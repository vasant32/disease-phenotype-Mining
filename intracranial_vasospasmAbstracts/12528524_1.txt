OBJECTIVE: To observe the changes of somatosensory evoked potential(SEP) and nitric oxide (NO) after subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH), and the influence of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb). METHOD: Rats in sham-operated group, SAH model group and EGb-treated group underwent measurement of dynamic changes of regional cerebral blood flow(rCBF), SEP and NO levels both in serum and in brain tissue within 24 h after operation. RESULT: In SAH group, rCBF decreased immediately after operation, with no tendency to recover within 24 h. The latency of SEP delayed progressively from 1 h to 24 h after SAH. NO levels in serum and in brain tissue decreased and increased respectively from 1 h to 24 h after SAH. EGb effectively antagonized the changes of above parameters. CONCLUSION: SEP is helpful in the judgement on brain ischemic damage after SAH. Decrease of NO in serum and increase of that in brain tissue may lead to cerebral vasospasm and ischemic brain damage respectively after SAH. EGb relieves SAH-induced brain ischemic damage by reversing the pathological alterations of NO.
