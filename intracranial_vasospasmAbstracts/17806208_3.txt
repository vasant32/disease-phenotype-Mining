OBJECTIVES: Increased calcium sensitization mediated by Rho/Rho-kinase may be important in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm. The effects of a highly selective Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, were investigated on spasmogen-induced contractions of canine basilar artery. METHODS: Typical spasmogenic substances present after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), including prostaglandin F2a (PGF2a), 12-deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate (DPB), sphingosylpho-sphorylcholine (SPC) and high K+, were used in the study. Isometric tension was recorded in canine basilar artery rings in vitro. Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and contraction force were measured simultaneously in fura-2-loaded canine basilar artery strips. The myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation levels were measured by glycerol gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Isometric tension recording revealed that the Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, dose-dependently inhibited vasocontraction induced by PGF2a and SPC, but not that induced by DPB. Simultaneous recordings of [Ca2+]i and tension revealed that the vasorelaxing effect of Y-27632 was not associated with changes in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that Y-27632 may inhibit calcium sensitization. Vasocontraction induced by DPB was not inhibited by Y-27632, but was inhibited by staurosporine. Phosphorylation of MLC was increased by PGF2a and SPC, and significantly inhibited by Y-27632, whereas such phosphorylation was increased by DPB, but not significantly inhibited by Y-27632. DISCUSSION: Several spasmogenic mediators released after SAH may cause vasospasm through Rho-kinase-mediated increase in calcium sensitization. Rho-kinase inhibitors, including Y-27632, may be effective for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm after SAH.
