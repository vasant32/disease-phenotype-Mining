Summary: A 22-year-old woman had an aneurysmal SAH due to a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm and was treated successfully with endovascular coiling. The patient subsequently developed severe clinical and angiographically distal vasospasm. After failure of both medical treatment and proximal balloon angioplasty, the NeuroFlo device was tried and the patient showed substantial clinical recovery. We demonstrated an excellent outcome using a novel treatment for distal cerebral vasospasm with the NeuroFlo device.
