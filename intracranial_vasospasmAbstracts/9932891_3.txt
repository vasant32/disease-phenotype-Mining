OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible role of the antioxidant ebselen in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm, we examined the effects of ebselen on the vasoactive mechanisms induced by endothelin (ET)-1, oxyhemoglobin, and oxygen-derived radicals. METHODS: Isolated rabbit basilar arteries with intact endothelium were fixed in a perfusion system and perfused intraluminally. Contraction of the artery was detected as an increase in perfusion pressure. RESULTS: Ebselen, in a certain concentration range (3 x 10(-6) and 10(-5) mol/L), significantly reduced the contractile response to ET-1 (10(-10) to 10(-8) mol/L) but not the contraction induced by 40 mmol/L potassium. It reduced the contraction induced by 10(-4) mol/L 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, a protein kinase C activator. Addition of 10(-5) mol/L dithiothreitol, a sulfhydryl-reducing agent, partially reversed the inhibitory effects of ebselen on ET-1- and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol-induced contractions. Ebselen (10(-5) mol/L) as well as a combination of catalase (1000 units/mL) and superoxide dismutase (150 units/mL) inhibited the potentiating effects of oxyhemoglobin (10(-5) mol/L) on ET-1-induced contraction. Both ebselen and catalase inhibited the contractile response to hydroxyl radical generated by ferrous ion (10(-3) mol/L) plus hydrogen peroxide (10(-2) mol/L). Ebselen reduced the response to potassium when a high dose (3 x 10(-5) mol/L) was applied and failed to preserve contractility of the preparation after exposure to hydroxyl radical. CONCLUSION: Ebselen suppressed ET-1-induced contraction and synergetic interaction between oxyhemoglobin and ET-1, where free radical formation was involved. These effects may result from modification of the intracellular regulatory system including protein kinase C, as well as from protection against free radicals.
