This article describes the pharmacological properties and the overall preclinical and clinical profiling of bosentan (Ro 47-0203), a non-peptide endothelin receptor antagonist with oral activity. Bosentan is a combined and competitive antagonist of both ETA and ETB receptors that is selective for the endothelin system. In vitro and in vivo, bosentan potently antagonises the vascular response elicited by the endothelins. Preclinical efficacy is demonstrated in a variety of pathological models including pulmonary and essential hypertension, renal failure of ischaemic and nephrotic origin and cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid haemorrhage. Effects are particularly marked in experimental models of heart failure (HF) where bosentan acts as a potent vasodilator that improves overall left ventricular performance. After chronic treatment, bosentan also improves survival in rats with HF. As a result of the first encouraging clinical results that show pulmonary and systemic vasodilation, long-term studies are ongoing in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF).
