Low density areas on computed tomography were correlated with changes in the neurological state of a patient who had cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured anterior communicating aneurysm. No aneurysm was revealed on repeated angiograms initially because of vasospasm, but a low density area was found in the inferior part of the left frontal lobe. Following an attack of low blood pressure on the 12th day his neurological state deteriorated and CT disclosed low density areas in the inferior part of both frontal lobes. The aneurysm was finally disclosed and operated successfully on the 49th day when cerebral vasospasm had disappeared completely.
