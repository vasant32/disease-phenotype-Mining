INTRODUCTION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage is one of the most common entities encountered in neurocritical care units. Knowledge of disease sequelae and their management is paramount for all neurointensivists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study relates the case of a 70-year-old woman with poor grade subarachnoid hemorrhage who underwent endovascular detachable coil embolization of a right internal carotid artery aneurysm. Her hospital course was subsequently complicated by symptomatic carotid stenosis and cerebral vasospasm requiring intervention. DISCUSSION: The discussants present their views regarding five main questions pertaining to management of the patient regarding the choice of endovascular versus surgical aneurysm occlusion, stent-supported angioplasty in a patient with a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage, and treatment options for vasospasm.
