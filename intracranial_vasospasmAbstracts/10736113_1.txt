Peripheral blood CD3+, CD19+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD45RO+ mononuclear cell subsets, T-cell proliferative responses to combinations of coimmobilized OKT3 antibody and an ECM protein (collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin or elastin), and T-cell adhesion to collagen IV, fibronectin and elastin were studied in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. No significant difference was found in the major lymphocyte subsets between subarachnoid haemorrhage patients receiving no dexamethasone for brain oedema treatment and healthy blood donors. Compared with the latter, both the dexamethasone-untreated and -treated subarachnoid haemorrhage patients showed decreased relative proliferative responses of circulating T cells to OKT3 combinations with collagen IV and fibronectin, and an increased PHA-activated T-cell adhesion to elastin. CD45RO+, CD4+ and CD19+ peripheral blood cell subsets, CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio, PHA-activated T-cell adhesion to fibronectin and collagen IV, and OKT3-triggered T-cell costimulatory responses to elastin, collagen IV and fibronectin were significantly higher in subarachnoid haemorrhage patients presenting with delayed cerebral vasospasm (DCV) than in their DCV-free counterparts. The DCV-related differences in circulating lymphocyte subsets showed no apparent relationship to the glucocorticoid treatment, whereas the differences in the other indices were confined to the dexamethasone-untreated subarachnoid haemorrhage patients. The above results suggest that the CD4+/CD8+ ratio and T cell-ECM interactions play a role in the emergence of subarachnoid haemorrhage/DCV and may represent potential targets for subarachnoid haemorrhage therapy.
