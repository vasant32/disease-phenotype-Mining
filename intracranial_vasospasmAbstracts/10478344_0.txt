Despite recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is still a serious condition associated with high mortality and morbidity. There are no effective treatments other than surgical intervention. However, another option for decreasing the occurrence of SAH may be prevention of aneurysms formation and of their rupture by controlling risk factors. Cigarette smoking has been recently shown to be one of the major risk factors for SAH. We investigated whether cigarette smoking increased the risk of developing cerebral aneurysms and of SAH. Degree of smoking was investigated in 182 patients with SAH and in 123 patients with an unruptured cerebral aneurysm incidentally detected during investigation of other diseases. Sixty-nine patients with other diseases who were shown to be free of cerebral aneurysms through MR angiography served as controls. Smoking significantly increased the risk of both aneurysm formation and SAH; The odds ratio for SAH was 2.4, and for unruptured cerebral aneurysm 1.7. Smoking especially increased the occurrence of SAH in women and in youngsters. However, smoking did not influence the occurrence of cerebral vasospasm and multiplicity of aneurysms. These data suggest the importance of avoiding smoking to prevent the occurrence of cerebral aneurysms and of SAH.
