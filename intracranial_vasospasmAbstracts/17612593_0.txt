OBJECTIVE: To study the expression change of interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene in the basilar artery of rabbit and the effect of IL-8 on the development of cerebral vasospasm induced by experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: Thirty five healthy Japanese White Rabbits were randomly divided into saline-control group and experimental group. The experimental group was subdivided into four groups, representing day 1, 4, 7 and 14 after the first blood injection of SAH. The delayed cerebral vasospasm (DCVS) model was established by double injection of autologous blood into the cisterna magna. The expression change of cytokine IL-8 mRNA in the basilar artery was analyzed by RTPCR. RESULTS: The expression of IL-8 gene increased on day 4-7 after the first blood injection of SAH compared with control (P< 0.001), and decreased to normal on day 14. The expression of IL-8 gene in the SAH groups were positively correlated with the degree of basilar artery stenosis (r = 0.642, P< 0.01). CONCLUSION: The expression level of IL-8 gene in basilar arteries was intimately associated with the degree of cerebral vasospasm, suggesting that IL-8 may play an important role in the DCVS after SAH as an immunological inflammatory factor.
