Magnesium has neuroprotective and antivasospastic properties in the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The present study investigated the effect of intracisternal administration of magnesium on cerebral vasospasm in the experimental SAH rat model. The rat double-SAH model (0.2 mL autologous blood injected twice into the cisterna magna) was used. Normal saline (SAH group, N=8) or 10 mmol/L magnesium sulfate in normal saline (SAH + MG group, N=8) was infused into the cisterna magna at 1.5 microL/min for 30 min on day 5. Control rats without SAH also received intracisternal infusion of normal saline (control group, N=6). Local cerebral blood flow (CBF) at 24 locations and the weighted average were quantitatively measured by the autoradiographic technique using [(14)C]iodoantipyrine during infusion. The weighted average CBF was significantly reduced (P<0.01, Student's t-test) in the SAH group (0.78+/-0.16 mL g(-1) min(-1)) compared to the control group (1.0+/-0.15 mL g(-1) min(-1)) and was significantly improved (P<0.01, Student's t-test) in the SAH + MG group (0.98+/-0.18 mL g(-1) min(-1)). Local CBF was significantly reduced (P<0.05, unpaired t test) in 16 locations in the SAH group and significantly improved (P < 0.05, unpaired t test) in 12 locations in the SAH + MG group. Intracisternal infusion of magnesium sulfate significantly improved reduced CBF induced by experimental SAH in the rat.
