15 patients after SAH from ruptured cerebral aneurysm were operated on within 72 hours after SAH. During the operation after clipping of aneurysm 10 mg of rtPA was administered into basal cisterns, Control group consisted of patients who did not receive rtPA. All the patients on the basis of CT scan were classified to III grade according to Fisher's classification. Control CT scan revealed dissolution of most clots in basal cisterns. In comparison with control group the patients who received rtPA rarely experienced radiological signs of vasospasm and delayed neurological deficit.
