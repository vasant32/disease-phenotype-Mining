We examined three groups of adult patients to evaluate the clinical application of transcranial colour-coded real-time sonography (TCCS): 28 patients suffering from intracerebral haemorrhage, 36 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and 38 patients with primary brain tumours. All sonographic examinations were performed through the intact skull. Cerebral haemorrhages were visualised via TCCS as hyperechogenic areas, which were closely correlated in size and location to CT findings. Apart from the imaging of subarachnoid haemorrhages and cerebral vasospasms, TCCS permitted the identification of the angiographically confirmed aneurysms in 76%. Brain tumours were delineated in the vast majority of the patients examined. In this type of pathology TCCS provided additional information on tumour extension and macroscopic appearance.
