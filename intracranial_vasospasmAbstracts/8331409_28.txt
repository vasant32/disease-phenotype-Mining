Although hemin is known to exert toxic effects on a variety of cell types, its possible participation in the genesis of cerebral vasospasm has received little attention. The authors measured the concentration of hemin in experimental subarachnoid clot and studied its effects on the morphology and 45Ca++ uptake of vascular smooth-muscle cells dissociated from canine carotid artery. Craniectomies were performed in five dogs under general anesthesia, and 3 to 5 ml of autologous whole blood was deposited in the supraclinoid subarachnoid compartment. The concentration of hemin recovered by Folch extraction from clotted material removed 7 days after surgery was 390 +/- 247 microM (mean +/- standard error of the mean). Mean vascular smooth-muscle cell length after 40 minutes of exposure to 50 microM hemin was 37.3 +/- 1.2 microns (control 51.6 +/- 1.6 microns) (p < 0.01). The mean percent permeation of 45Ca++, measured by a dual label technique, of cells exposed to hemin was 200.9% +/- 23% (control 102.9% +/- 4.3%) (p < 0.01). These findings indicate that hemin accrues in subarachnoid hematoma, that it exerts a constrictive effect on vascular smooth-muscle cells, and that this effect is associated with an increased uptake of Ca++. This study demonstrates that hemin should be included in the list of potential agents that participate in the development of cerebral vasospasm.
