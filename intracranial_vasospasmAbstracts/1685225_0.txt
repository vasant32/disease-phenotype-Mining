In order to evaluate various spasmogens, which are candidates for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage, the intracellular calcium mobilizations were examined in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells preloaded with a fluorescent Ca2+ probe fura-2. Endothelin, oxyhaemoglobin, 5-hydroxytryptamine, norepinephrine, prostaglandin F2 alpha, leukotrienes C4 and D4 produced dose-dependent increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). However, bilirubin did not induce any significant [Ca2+]i elevation. The maximal levels of [Ca2+]i peak attained by endothelin or oxyhaemoglobin were higher than those of other compounds. Endothelin was the most potent in that it induced a high sustained [Ca2+]i elevation at much lower concentrations compared with others. The combination of oxyhaemoglobin and endothelin induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a sustained lower plateau, then the [Ca2+]i level was again increased slowly followed by a sustained higher plateau which lasted for more than 10 min after the exposure. These results suggest that endothelin and/or oxyhaemoglobin may play a crucial role in contraction of vascular smooth muscle after subarachnoid haemorrhage.
