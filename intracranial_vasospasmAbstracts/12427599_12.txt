A substantial number of rat models have been used to research subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced cerebral vasospasm; however, controversy exists regarding which method of selection is appropriate for this species. This study was designed to provide extensive information about the three most popular subarachnoid hemorrhage rat models: the endovascular puncture model, the single-hemorrhage model, and the double-hemorrhage model. In this study, the basilar artery and posterior communicating artery were chosen for histopathological examination and morphometric analysis. Both the endovascular puncture model and single-hemorrhage model developed significant degrees of vasospasm, which were less severe when compared with the double-hemorrhage model. The endovascular puncture model and double-hemorrhage model both developed more vasospasms in the posterior communicating artery than in the basilar artery. The endovascular puncture model has a markedly high mortality rate and high variability in bleeding volume. Overall, the present study showed that the double-hemorrhage model in rats is a more suitable tool with which to investigate mechanism and therapeutic approaches because it accurately correlates with the time courses for vasospasm in humans.
