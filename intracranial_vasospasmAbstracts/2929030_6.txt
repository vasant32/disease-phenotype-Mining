We produced cerebral vasospasm in 29 dogs by the "two-hemorrhage" method of intracisternal injections, 2 days apart, of autogenous arterial blood. Leukotriene (LT) C4, LTD4, and LTE4 were purified from incubated basilar artery, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, median eminence, and blood clot from around the basilar artery using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and the amount of each LT was quantified separately by bioassay with guinea pig ileum. The biosynthetic capacity for total LTs was approximately three times higher in the hypothalamus and median eminence than in the basilar artery and medulla oblongata in the eight normal dogs. In the dogs with subarachnoid hemorrhage, the biosynthetic capacity was increased significantly both before and 2 hours after the second injection of blood on Day 2 and was normal on Day 7 in the basilar artery and medulla oblongata, whereas the biosynthetic capacity was decreased significantly 2 hours after the first and second injections of blood and was increased significantly on Day 7 in the hypothalamus and median eminence. In blood clot the biosynthetic capacity was increased continuously after the first injection of blood. Thus, the biosynthetic capacity for total LTs showed a time- and tissue-specific change after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
