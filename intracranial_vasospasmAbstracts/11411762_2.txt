Gene transfer to blood vessels is remarkably effective in altering vasomotor function, and has proven to be a useful tool for studying vascular biology. Gene therapy for cardiovascular diseases is an attractive new approach, which will be used initially for diseases in which pharmacologic approaches are not effective. Preliminary data suggest that two possible targets for gene therapy are prevention of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage and treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Perhaps, as better vectors are developed, common clinical problems such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia also may become targets for gene therapy.
