Three cases of symptomatic vasospasm after spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage are reported. Vasospasm occurred preoperatively in two instances and postoperatively in another. All three cases received an intraarterial perfusion with 0.2 mg nimodipine (BAY e 9736) per hour for 90 minutes. Resolution of the spasms was demonstrated by angiography. As there were no side effects attributable to this form of treatment, new possibilities for neuroradiological intervention may arise in selected cases.
