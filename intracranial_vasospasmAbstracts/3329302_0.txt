The present studies show that nimodipine prevents and/or improves permanent ischemic neurological deficits in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. This was particularly marked in four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in which statistically significant reductions in mortality and morbidity as consequence of cerebral vasospasm were found. The drug has been shown to increase cerebral blood flow, to reduce vasoconstriction, although not to fully prevent angiographic vasospasm, and to improve central conduction time. Nimodipine did not increase the rate of rebleeding. Its administration during anesthesia does not result in management problems. In general, nimodipine was well tolerated. Side effects were recorded mainly in open studies using the intravenous formulation and consisted mainly of decreases in blood pressure and headaches. Transient increases in liver enzymes may be due to the organic solvent. Hence, all results indicate that patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage will benefit from preventive or therapeutic nimodipine treatment.
