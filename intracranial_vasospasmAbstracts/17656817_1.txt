Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare neurological condition identifiable by clinical presentation and MRI appearance.1 Patients present with headache, seizures, loss of vision and altered mental function. The pathogenesis of the syndrome is poorly understood. One hypothesis is that cerebral vasospasm results in cerebral ischaemia and subsequent development of T2 hyperintensity, and the other is a temporary failure of the autoregulatory capabilities of the cerebral vessels, leading to hyperperfusion, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and consequent vasogenic oedema. It is believed that a rapid rise in blood pressure overcomes cerebral autoregulatory mechanisms with abrupt dilatation of cerebral arterioles. We report a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and PRES after recurrent spontaneous abortion.
