Throughout the period 1943 to 1980, 1368 patients with verified intracranial saccular aneurysms were treated in the University of Aarhus neurosurgical department. Forty-three (3.1%) patients (25 boys and 18 girls) were 19 years old or younger, and 33 (77%) had an onset of symptoms typical of subarachnoid bleeding. Using the classification system of Hunt and Hess as a basis for clinical assessment on admission, 58% of the patients could be placed in Grade I or II. Cerebral vasospasm was demonstrated in 53% of the patients undergoing angiography between the 4th and 16th day after hemorrhage. There was no increased morbidity or mortality in the group of patients with vasospasm, and no cerebral infarction was demonstrated at necropsy. Therefore, it is possible that vasospasm is of minor prognostic significance in children. In 15 patients (37%), aneurysm rupture was accompanied by intracerebral hematoma. The mortality rate in this group of 15 patients was 50%, whereas in the group without hematoma it was 26%. The overall mortality rate was 33%. The surviving 29 patients were followed for 3 months to 14 years. Twenty-three patients made a good recovery (80% of survivors and 54% of the total series), five were moderately disabled, and one was severely disabled.
