OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of balloon angioplasty and intra-arterial infusion of vasodilating agents for patients suffering from severe vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is often unsatisfying and there is still demand for further last resort treatment strategies. In the current prospective study, we attempted the intrathecal lavage administration of nimodipine in cases of severe cerebral vasospasm that were refractory to medical and endovascular therapy. METHODS: Eight of 146 patients with aneurysmal SAH were included in the prospective study, which had been approved by the local ethics committee. Treatment was instituted by intraventricular nimodipine bolus (0.4 mg), followed by a continuous lumbar intrathecal infusion (0.4 mg/h). Effectiveness was monitored angiographically, with transcranial Doppler (TCD), perfusion CT (pCT), and by neurological examination during treatment course and follow-up. RESULTS: The neurological condition improved directly in three patients and remained unchanged in four patients. Seventeen (70.8%) CT perfusion analyses revealed improved perfusion. A reduction of vasospasm was seen angiographically by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in seven (66.6%) investigations. Additional ischaemic infarction after onset of the intrathecal therapy was documented in two (25%) patients. There were no serious adverse effects observed. CONCLUSION: The present study has for the first time demonstrated the feasibility and safety of intrathecal nimodipine lavage in patients with severe vasospasm resistant to the established medical and endovascular treatment strategies. The results of the study are therefore encouraging, and further experimental and clinical trials should be carried out so as to investigate the efficacy of intrathecal nimodipine lavage in vasospasm therapy.
