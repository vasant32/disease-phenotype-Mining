The short-term (less than or equal to 72-hour) reaction to subarachnoid injections of various blood components was determined in a canine model of cerebral vasospasm. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) formed durable clots in the basal cistern surrounding the basilar artery and provoked no vascular reaction in 72 hours or more. Freshly isolated autologous erythrocytes resuspended in PRP likewise provoked no vasoconstriction in 72 hours although a second injection of fresh erythrocytes in PRP induced significant reaction, as in the conventional "double subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)" canine model. Hemolysate of fresh erythrocytes led to a severe immediate vascular reaction after introduction into the basal cistern using PRP as the carrier/clotting medium, as did the injection of intact erythrocytes incubated ex vivo for 72 hours. Resolution of the initial reaction was rapid for hemolysate, but slow and (depending on hematocrit) incomplete for intact "aged" erythrocytes. In vitro measurements of erythrocyte lysis in these media and histological examination indicate that the production of erythrocyte lysate was responsible for the vascular reaction observed, suggesting that the rate of lysis of erythrocytes in the subarachnoid clot is a major factor in the genesis of vasospasm after SAH.
