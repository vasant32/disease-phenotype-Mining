Benign headaches related to sexual activity and exertion are being recognised with increasing frequency. We wish to report a case of benign sexual headache (Type 2) and benign exertional headache, occurring sequentially in the same patient. Multiple areas of cerebral arterial spasm were demonstrable on angiography. This observation would support the concept that benign sexual headache (Type 2) and benign exertional headache may have a similar pathophysiology.
