Cerebral vasospasm presents a challenge for the nursing staff. To date, no effective prevention methods have been identified. The key to decreasing the mortality rates is in discovering a method of preventing or reversing the arterial narrowing caused by vasospasm. The nurse needs to be aware of the theories of vasospasm and the rationale for treatment. Neurologic assessment skills are important for the nurse to detect minimal changes that may indicate vasospasm. Nurses who are informed will be able to provide optimal care to patients with cerebral vasospasm and provide the necessary support for family members. Drug therapy continues to be the first-line defense in treating vasospasm. Nimodipine is a very promising drug with demonstrated effectiveness to reduce the neurologic deficits caused by vasospasm. Further research on the treatment of vasospasm following SAH is currently in progress.
