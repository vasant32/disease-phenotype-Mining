Posttraumatic vasospasms occur according to various authors in 5-10% of cases, and in our material they were demonstrated in 6% of the patients, that is about 8 times less frequently than in cases of bleeding from a vascular malformation. Computed tomography of the head showing posttraumatic vasospasm complicating "normal" clinical course is ever less frequent which does not mean that this disturbance is not occurring, but rather it shows that CT is insufficient for its demonstration. It was shown that in every case of unclear aetiology in which the clinical condition is not correlating with CT pattern of the head angiography of brain vessels should be performed or cerebral blood flow should be determined by other making possible early institution of adequate (targeted) treatment.
