Cerebral vasospasm is a major cause of morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. With improvement in surgical techniques and perioperative care, the results in neurologically intact patients are generally satisfactory. However, cerebral vasospasm remains a major problem in the successful management of neurologically deteriorating patients. Until the pathophysiology of cerebral vasospasm is clarified, a reliable treatment regimen will remain elusive and the overall outlook for patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage will remain limited.
