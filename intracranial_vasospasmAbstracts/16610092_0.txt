OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between cerebral vasospasm and occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND). METHODS: The clinical records and radiographic images of 118 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted during last 5 years were reviewed. The incidence,degree and localization of cerebral vasospasm were evaluated, and morbidity of related DIND was analyzed. Patients with cerebral vasospasm were divided into three groups: Group MCA (middle cerebral artery), Group ACA (anterior cerebral artery) and Group ICA (intracranial carotid artery) according to the location of cerebral vasospasm. The consistency of DIND and image of cerebral infarction were examined. RESULT: There was a weak correlation between cerebral vasospasm and incidence of DIND (r=0.22; P=0.016). The incidence of DIND was increased with severity of cerebral vasospasm (U=2.589, P<0.05). The group MCA had a significantly higher incidence of DIND than that of ACA and ICA groups (68.0% compared with 36.7% and 25.0%, respectively, chi(2)=8.195, P=0.004), the difference between later two groups was not statistically significant (chi(2)=0.646, P=0.421). CONCLUSION: Cerebral vasospasm may be an important factor leading to DIND occurrence; the severity and location of cerebral vasospasm is related to the incidence of DIND.
