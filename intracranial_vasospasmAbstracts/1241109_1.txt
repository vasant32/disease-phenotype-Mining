The management of patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysm is complicated by an apparently irreducible and unmanageable morbidity that can be traced directly to cerebral vasoconstriction. Technical skills required to attack aneurysms successfully have been mastered by many surgeons. Vasospasm, on the other hand, remains a challenge and has yet to respond to any practical modality of treatment. Spasm of the basilar artery in the dog was induced by the injection of blood into the cisterna magna, and documented by means of vertebral angiography. The author, also, described the modification of experimental cerebral vasospasm by the administration of reserpine to deplete platelets of serotonin as well as other vasoactive amines such as histamine and catecholamines.
