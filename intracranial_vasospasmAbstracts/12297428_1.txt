OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in the expression of neuropeptide Y mRNA in the cerebral tissues of rat models of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), to shed light on the prevention and treatment of cerebral vasospasm induced by SAH. METHODS: SAH rat models, saline and sham-operation control groups were respectively established, in which the relative abundance of neuropeptide Y mRNA in the corpus striatum, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus were subsequently measured and compared by reverse transcriptase PCR at 15 min, 30 min and 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 h after corresponding treatment. RESULTS: The abundance of neuropeptide Y mRNA significantly elevated in the cerebral tissues after SAH, and gradually declined with the passage of time, but were still significantly higher than that of saline and sham-operation controls at any of the same time points. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropeptide Y mRNA level in the cerebral tissues significantly elevates after SAH, which may play an important role in inducing cerebral vasospasm.
