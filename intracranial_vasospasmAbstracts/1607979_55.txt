Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) endothelin (ET)-1-like immunoactivity in 27 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was measured serially by radioimmunoassay for 2 weeks after SAH onset. Mean ET-1-like immunoactivity levels in plasma of patients with SAH were highly elevated during the whole study period, while the levels in CSF of the same patients were not. Plasma ET-1-like immunoactivity levels in patients with SAH classified as Fisher computerized tomography (CT) Group 3 were higher than those in patients with SAH classified as Fisher CT Groups 1 and 2. There were no significant differences in plasma ET-1-like immunoactivity levels between the patient groups stratified by Hunt and Kosnik grade. In this series, plasma ET-1-like immunoactivity levels in the 12 patients with vasospasm were higher than those in the 15 patients without vasospasm during the 1st week; CSF ET-1-like immunoactivity levels in patients with vasospasm were in the normal range on Days 0 to 3 after SAH onset, then became elevated on Days 5 to 7 and remained high until the end of the 2nd week. In contrast, CSF ET-1-like immunoactivity levels in patients without vasospasm were within the normal range during the entire period of study. The time course of the occurrence of vasospasm and that of the increase in CSF ET-1-like immunoactivity coincided precisely. The possible role of endogenous ET-1 in the pathogenesis of vasospasm due to SAH is discussed.
