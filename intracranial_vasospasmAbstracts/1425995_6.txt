We examined the possible prophylactic potential of HA1077, a calcium antagonist and vasodilator, on chronic cerebral vasospasm induced in a two-hemorrhage canine model, and also its effects on cerebral hemodynamics. The intravenous infusion of HA1077 3 mg/kg over 30 min twice daily (day 1-day 7) after the first intracisternal injection of 5 ml autologous blood significantly prevented the occurrence of chronic cerebral vasospasm. The mean diameter of the basilar arteries on day 7 was 66.1 +/- 1.6% (n = 7) of the baseline before the intracisternal injection of blood, compared to 54.2 +/- 1.6% (n = 9) of the baseline in the untreated group (P less than 0.01). Bolus intravenous administration of HA1077 (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) dose dependently increased local cerebral blood flow. Since HA1077 prevents the development of chronic cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage and improves hemodynamic functions, as manifested by increases in local cerebral blood flow, further study is warranted regarding the possible clinical use of this drug.
