In order to study how immune-inflammatory responses are involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), the kinetics of expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), a ligand for the leucocyte adhesion receptor, were studied on the cerebral arteries following SAH in rats. The SAH was induced by intracisternal injection of arterial blood. The rats were sacrificed at specified times: immediately after induction of SAH to seven days after SAH. Cryostat sections of the basilar artery (BA) were prepared and incubated with anti-rat ICAM-1 antibody. Morphometric analysis of the BA revealed a significant narrowing of the luminal diameter on Day 2 following SAH. While in the non-treated normal animals, no nor only weak expression of ICAM-1 was observed on the endothelial layer of the BA, there was greater expression of ICAM-1 on the endothelial layer of the BA in SAH rats, and the expression was observed also in the medial layer of the artery from Day 2 to Day 5 following SAH. The present results indicate that SAH really causes responses in the cellular immunity not only in the endothelial layer, but also in the medial layer of the artery as a target of immune damage, which is presumed to be one of the important steps in the development of cerebral vasospasm.
