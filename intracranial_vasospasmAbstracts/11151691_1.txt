In a retrospective study, we investigated whether embolisation of intracranial aneurysms during the spasm period (days 3-14) after subarachnoid haemorrhage carries an increased risk. A comparison was made with patients embolised during the same period but in the first 2 days after the haemorrhage. The two groups compared well except for a higher incidence of posterior circulation aneurysm in the group with delayed treatment. There seems to be no difference in the short-term outcome between the two.
