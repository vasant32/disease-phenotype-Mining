Despite recent advances in the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage delayed ischaemic deficits from cerebral vasospasm remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. As magnesium is a potent cerebral vasodilator we have introduced routine supplementation in patients presented with subarachnoid haemorrhage to determine whether there has been a reduction in the incidence of cerebral vasospasm. Method: All patients presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage from February 1997 were included except those who presented after day 5 following bleed. Identical management protocol was used except intravenous magnesium supplementation which was introduced to all patients from May 1999. Incidence of cerebral vasospasm on angiograms among the two groups was analysed. Results: Seven out of 10 patients who did not receive magnesium supplement developed vasospasm requiring intra-arterial papaverine compared with 2 of 13 patients among the treated group (P<0.008). Conclusions: From our pilot study it appears that magnesium supplement has a beneficial role in the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Further studies would seem justified.
