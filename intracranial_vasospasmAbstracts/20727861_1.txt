It has been suggested that the pathogenesis of vasospasm is complex including endothelial damage, oxidative stress, inflammatory damage, and the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Recently, a growing body of evidence indicates that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays a unique role in many physiological stress processes. In this study, a total of 48 rabbits were assigned randomly to four groups: control group, SAH day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups. The animals in SAH day 3, day 5, and day 7 groups were subjected to injection of autologous blood into cisterna magna twice on day 0 and day 2 and were killed on days 3, 5, and 7, respectively. Cross-sectional area of basilar artery was measured and the Nrf2 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. The mRNA levels of Nrf2 were also determined by RT-PCR. The basilar arteries exhibited vasospasm after SAH and became more severe on days 3 and 5. The elevated expression of Nrf2 was detected after SAH and peaked on days 3 and 5. Nrf2 is increasingly expressed in a parallel time course to the development of cerebral vasospasm in a rabbit experimental model of SAH.
