Calcium blockers are being investigated for a potential role in the prevention and treatment of cerebral vasospasm. They have been found to inhibit platelet function both with in vivo and with in vitro experiments. Clinical evidence of abnormal platelet function is sparse, however. We are presenting three patients who developed increased bleeding times that reverted to normal when the diltiazem was discontinued. This may lead to serious consequences in the presence of an unsecured aneurysm and for patients facing major intracranial surgery.
