Cerebral vasospasm and rebleeding are important clinical phenomena associated with a high mortality rate. Therefore, any promising finding in the laboratory deserves assessment in clinical practice. The present study was designed to examine the possible effects of trapidil on the basilar artery of the rabbit through a cerebral vasospasm model. This experimental study was carried out on 26 adult New Zealand albino rabbits of both sexes weighing 2.5-3.0 kg. A transclival exposure was performed. Vasospasm was produced by an intracisternal injection of autologous blood. After observation of the vasospasm, trapidil was locally applied in increasing concentrations (10(-5)-10(-4) M). The effect of each concentration was measured independently after 10 minutes for each application and was extended to three hours. Trapidil was shown to have a clear spasmolytic effect on the rabbit's basilar artery. These data suggest that trapidil can have a potential use in the treatment of patients suffering from cerebral vasospasm.
