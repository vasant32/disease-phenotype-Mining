Positron emission tomography was performed using an oxygen-15 gas inhalation technique to measure regional cerebral blood flow, metabolic rate for oxygen, oxygen extraction fraction, and cerebral blood volume in 13 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage during the period of delayed vasospasm after surgery as well as in 10 volunteers as controls. Compared with the controls, the patients showed decreased hemoglobin concentration and decreased total arterial oxygen content due to postoperative hemodilution. Global reductions in the metabolic rate for oxygen and in the tissue oxygen supply were noted even in the apparently normal cortex of the patients in spite of adequate blood flow and adequate oxygen extraction fraction. In addition, regional reductions in blood flow and in perfusion reserve were seen in the cortical territory corresponding to cerebral vasospasm. Our results indicate that two processes are involved in the pathophysiology of cerebral vasospasm: 1) generalized impairment of oxygen metabolism with a reduced tissue oxygen supply, even in the apparently normal cortex, and 2) additional impairment of regional perfusion in the territory of vasospasm.
