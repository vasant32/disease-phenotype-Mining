Acute vasospasm of the transclivally exposed basilar artery of anesthetised cats was produced by the subarachnoid injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treated with enough adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to induce platelet aggregation and secretion. Vasorelaxation was produced by the topical application of the calcium antagonist verapamil. Changes in the internal diameter of the basilar artery were determined by measuring the blood column diameter from photomicrographs taken sequentially, at 5 minute intervals, through the operating microscope. Changes in blood vessel diameter are expressed as a plus or minus percentage of the pretreatment diameter. Arterial blood pressure and blood gas values were kept in the physiological range for the cat. The subarachnoid injection of PRP-ADP produced severe constriction of the basilar artery (mean constriction at 5 minutes after injection: -40.7% +/- 2.8 SEM). Platelet-free plasma, ADP alone and Elliott's A solution had no spasmogenic effect when injected into the subarachnoid space. The topical application of the calcium channel blocker verapamil (0.1 mg per kg) 30 minutes after the injection of PRP-ADP, with the basilar artery still in spasm (mean constriction: -23% +/- 3.5 SEM), produced prompt and dramatic vasodilation (mean dilation at 5 minutes after application: +52.7% +/- 18.1 SEM). This spasmolytic effect persisted in a decremental fashion for the 60 minute period of observation, by which time the previously constricted vessel had returned to its normal size. These observations indicate that the platelet fraction of whole blood may be involved in the genesis of acute vasospasm following subarachnoid hemmorrhage and that this phenomenon can be readily reversed by calcium antagonism.
