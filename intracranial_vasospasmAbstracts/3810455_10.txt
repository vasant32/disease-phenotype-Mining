Many investigators have concluded that hemoglobin is the spasmogen responsible for cerebral vasospasm. The present study was designed to ascertain whether the contractile responses of isolated canine basilar arteries to xanthochromic cerebrospinal fluid from subarachnoid hemorrhage patients was associated with hemoglobin concentration as measured spectrophotometrically. The results clearly showed that spasmogenicity and hemoglobin content were not correlated. The magnitude and duration of the arterial responses varied greatly, further indicating that more than a single factor was responsible. The potent antagonistic, vasodilator effect of such proteins as antithrombin III may account for some of the variation, but the results directly complement clinical findings of others indicating that hemoglobin is not the singular cause of cerebral vasospasm.
