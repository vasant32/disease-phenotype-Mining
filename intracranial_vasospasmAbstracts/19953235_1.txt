 INTRODUCTION: Cerebral vasospasm (CV) remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Here, we examined the effectiveness and safety of intra-arterial injection of colforsin daropate hydrochloride (CDH). METHODS: A consecutive series of 29 patients with angiographically confirmed CV received intra-arterial CDH (IAC) therapy. Angiographic changes in spastic vessels and the cerebral circulation time (CCT) were assessed before and after IAC treatment, together with the change in clinical status. RESULTS: IAC treatment was performed in 53 procedures in 29 patients. Angiographic improvement was observed following all procedures (100%), and clinical improvement was observed following 36 of 42 procedures (86%) in symptomatic cases. CCT improved significantly. At the 3-month follow-up, 19 patients (66%) showed good recovery or moderate disability on the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Major adverse effects were headache and increased heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: IAC treatment was effective and safe for the treatment of CV after SAH.
