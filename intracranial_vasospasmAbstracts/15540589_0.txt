Patients admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage are monitored for symptoms of vasospasm. A prospective study was designed to compare two monitoring instruments: a standard neurological tool (SNR) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The two assessment tools were compared to evaluate their concordance and to identify areas where efficiency in recording assessments might be improved. We found no statistical difference between the two tools in detecting symptomatic cerebral vasospasm. Substantial discrepancies in the documentation of observations were noted, particularly in the assessment of limb drift. Avoidance of these discrepancies may require further definition in the SNR tool. A qualitative component consisting of a review of the nurses' notes regarding neurological status in the patients' charts was conducted. It was demonstrated that nurses commonly document information in the progress notes that is already captured in the SNR. Further education of nurses in the use of assessment tools is therefore recommended to avoid redundancies and increase efficiency in recording clinical observations.
