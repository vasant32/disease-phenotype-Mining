Since their discovery in 1988, endothelins have attracted scientific interest because of their extremely potent and long lasting vasoconstrictive effects. In the clinical part of the study plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of big endothelin-1, endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were measured serially for 2 weeks after the onset of SAH. Big endothelin-1 was the predominant peptide present in CSF. The CSF concentrations of big ET-1, ET-1 and ET-3 were significantly higher in older than in younger patients. In patients with cerebral vasospasm postoperative concentrations of endothelins in the CSF remained at or were increased above levels measured before surgery. The volume of hematoma in the basal cisterns was predictive of the concentrations of endothelins in CSF. In the experimental study the efficacy of the orally active endothelin-receptor-antagonist RO 47-0203 for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm after experimental SAH, using the canine two-hemorrhage model, was investigated. Twenty-eight beagle dogs were used in this laboratory experiment. Fourteen animals each were assigned to the treatment and to the control group. In the treatment group each dog received two single doses of 30 mg/kg RO 47-0203 orally per day. The diameter of the basilar artery decreased from 1.36 +/- 0.17 mm at day 1 to 1.19 +/- 0.23 mm at day 8 in the treatment group while in the control group the vessel diameter decreased from 1.48 +/- 0.19 mm at day 1 to 1.02 +/- 0.22 mm at day 8. These results corresponded to a decrease of vessel diameter of 13.1% +/- 11.2% in the treatment group and a decrease of vessel diameter of 30.7% +/- 12.4% in the control group (p < 0.001). Concentrations of endothelin-1 in CSF significantly increased with time after SAH. These results underline the important role of endothelin in the development of cerebral vasospasm, and gives for the first time evidence that prevention of cerebral vasospasm can be achieved by the endothelin-receptor-antagonist RO 47-0203.
