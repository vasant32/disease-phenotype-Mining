BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies suggest statins ameliorate aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced cerebral vasospasm and ischemic complications. We tested safety and feasibility of simvastatin 80 mg/d for vasospasm prevention in SAH patients. METHODS: Thirty-nine statin-na√Øve Fisher grade 3 SAH subjects were double-blind randomized to receive simvastatin 80 mg/d (n=19) or placebo (n=20), stratified by Hunt and Hess grade. Primary end points were death and drug morbidity. RESULTS: Mortality was 3/20 in the placebo and 0/19 in the simvastatin group. Study drug was withdrawn in 1 subject in each treatment group for reversible liver enzyme or creatine phosphokinase elevation. Angiographically-confirmed vasospasm occurred in 8/20 placebo and 5/19 simvastatin-treated subjects. Vasospasm-related ischemic infarcts developed in 5/20 placebo and 2/19 simvastatin-treated subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Simvastatin for the prevention of delayed cerebral ischemia is safe and feasible after SAH. A larger study is needed to test its efficacy.
