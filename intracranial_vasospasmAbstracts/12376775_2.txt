BACKGROUND: Chronic cerebral vasospasm is delayed-onset cerebral arterial narrowing in response to blood clots left in the subarachnoid space after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Rabbit models of vasospasm have been developed as in vivo experimental pathogenesis and the treatments of cerebral vasospasm using human vessels are not possible. The present study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV-DSA) in chronic cerebral arterial spasm following induced SAH in the rabbit. METHOD: Ten rabbits' left leg veins catheterised by intravascular access needle and 3F catheters introduced to the right leg arteries probing the proximal of the vertebral arteries. Initially IV-DSA and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA) was performed. Three millilitres of fresh autologous arterial blood was injected into the cisterna magna of the ten rabbits' in order to produce in vivo model of chronic SAH. Angiograms were obtained 15 minutes and 72 hours after the SAH. FINDINGS: Diameters of the basilar arteries were similar to each other in both methods and reduced after the SAH. Interpretation:The present study shows that IV-DSA is a relatively simple and effective method for demonstrating cerebral vessels, especially the basilar artery.
