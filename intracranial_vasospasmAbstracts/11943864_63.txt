Cerebral vasospasm and ischemic damage are important causes of mortality and morbidity in patients affected by aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Recently, i.p. administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-Hu-EPO) has been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect during experimental SAH. The present study was conducted to evaluate further the effect of r-Hu-EPO administration after SAH in rabbits on neurological outcome, degree of basilar artery spasm, and magnitude of neuronal ischemic damage. Experimental animals were divided into six groups: group 1 (n = 8), control; group 2 (n = 8), control plus placebo; group 3 (n = 8), control plus r-Hu-EPO; group 4 (n = 8), SAH; group 5 (n = 8), SAH plus placebo; group 6 (n = 8), SAH plus r-Hu-EPO. r-Hu-EPO, at a dose of 1,000 units/kg, and placebo were injected i.p. starting 5 min after inducing SAH and followed by clinical and pathological assessment 72 h later. Systemic administration of r-Hu-EPO produced significant increases in cerebrospinal fluid EPO concentrations (P < 0.001), and reduced vasoconstriction of the basilar artery (P < 0.05), ischemic neuronal damage (P < 0.001), and subsequent neurological deterioration (P < 0.05). These observations suggest that r-Hu-EPO may provide an effective treatment to reduce the post-SAH morbidity.
