BACKGROUND: Cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains a major complication in patients suffering from SAH. In our previous study, we reported that stimulating vascular K(+) channel activity prevented the development of cerebral vasospasm. Recent evidence indicates that glyceryl nonivamide (GLNVA), a capsaicin derivative, has a vasorelaxant effect on the aortic vascular smooth muscle due to the release of coronary calcitonin gene-related peptide, which in turn stimulates K(+) channel opening. The purpose of the present study was to examine the preventive effects of GLNVA on vasospasm. METHODS: New Zealand white rabbits were subjected to experimental SAH by injecting autologous blood into the cisterna magna. GLNVA or vehicle was injected intrathecally immediately after the induction of SAH. All animals were killed by perfusion-fixation at 48 hours after SAH. The basilar arteries were removed and sectioned, and their cross-sectional areas were measured. RESULTS: The average cross-sectional areas of basilar arteries were reduced by 69% and 71% in the SAH only and SAH plus vehicle groups, respectively, when compared with the healthy controls. After treatment with 0.35, 1.75, and 3.5 mg/kg GLNVA in rabbits subjected to SAH the average cross-sectional area was decreased by 46%, 12% and 2%, respectively, when compared with the healthy controls. The protective effect of GLNVA achieved statistical significance at all dosages. Morphologically, corrugation of the internal elastic lamina of vessels was often observed in the vehicle-treated group, but was not prominent in the GLNVA-treated groups or healthy controls. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that GLNVA dose-dependently attenuated cerebral vasospasm after SAH in the rabbit. These results suggest that intrathecal administration of GLNVA could be an effective strategy for preventing cerebral vasospasm after SAH.
