It is proposed that the basic mechanism of vasospasm which sometimes follows subarachnoid hemorrhage is dependent on increased free intracellular calcium ion produced by spasmogens from closely applied extravasated blood. Relaxation of this spasm occurs when the intracellular cyclic AMP levels are raised, resulting in sequestration of calcium ion by the vascular smooth muscle cell sarcoplasmic reticulum.
