The problem of cerebral arteriospasm following rupture of intracranial aneurysm is analysed comprehensively in the clinical, angiographic, electroencephalographic and, particularly, neurosurgical aspects in a group of 51 cases. Seventy-six patients without arteriospasm after aneurysm rupture served as controls. It was found that cerebral arteriospasm caused deterioration of the preoperative condition of the patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and influenced unfavourably the results of surgical treatment of patients with intracranial aneurysm.
