The pharmacological properties of a novel thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist, ONO-3708, on blood vessels were examined in vitro and in vivo. ONO-3708, 10 microM, inhibited the rabbit aorta contractions induced by thromboxane A2, prostaglandin H2, 11,9-epoxymethano-prostaglandin H2 (U-46619) or prostaglandin F2 alpha without affecting the contractions induced by angiotensin II, serotonin or norepinephrine. ONO-3708, at a concentration of 1 to 100 nM, appeared to be a competitive inhibitor of the contractile responses of the canine basilar artery to 9,11-epithio-11,12-methano-thromboxane A2 (STA2), U-46619 and PGF2 alpha, and a non-competitive inhibitor of the contractile responses to 15-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE). In in vivo studies, ONO-3708 (10 and 100 micrograms/kg per min i.v.) ameliorated the decrease in diameter of the basilar artery induced by the i.v. infusion of STA2 (0.1 microgram/kg per min) in cats. Furthermore, infusion of ONO-3708 (10 and 30 micrograms/kg per min i.v.) prevented the cerebral vasospasm in an experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage model in dogs. These results indicate that ONO-3708 is a potent antagonist of the thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor in vitro and in vivo and may be of therapeutic use in preventing cerebral vasospasm.
