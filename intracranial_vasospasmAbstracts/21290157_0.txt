Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) was described in patients after trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgery due to intra-operative trauma of arteries or blood clots around the arteries of Willis' circle. We consider that in the two presented cases the main cause of CVS in early postoperative period was meningitis. Two patients with pituitary adenomas were operated with trans-sphenoidal approach. CVS developed in early postoperative period. Meningitis was revealed in both cases. CVS regressed only after successful treatment of meningitis. In the first case empiric antibiotic therapy was ineffective and CVS remained until Klebsiella pneumonia was detected in CSF and specific therapy was performed. In the second case empiric therapy was effective and CVS vasospasm regressed in 12Â days. These cases show that meningitis can be a leading cause of CVS in early postoperative period in trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgery. Adequate treatment of meningitis shortens duration of CVS in these patients.
