To explore whether topical administration of Nimodipine improves the cerebral blood flow (CBF) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in pigs. Fourteen pigs were randomly divided into Sham group(n=4), SAH group(n=5) or SAH+ Nimodipine group(n=5). The SAH model was established by injection of fresh autologous nonheparinized arterial blood into subtemporal area of basilar cisterns. The operative area was administrated with 0.04g/ml Nimodipine or saline placebo at 4 days after SAH. The CBF was measured at 60 minutes after topical administration of nimodipine by cranial CT/SPECT scans with 5 mCi 99mTc-ECD intravenously. The CCR (Corticocebellar ratio) was calculated by dividing the counts/voxel of the whole cerebral hemisphere by the average count /voxel in the cerebellar region of reference and RD (relative dispersion) was calculated by dividing standard deviation (SD) of regional perfusion by mean perfusion (RD=SD /Mean). CCR and RD were applied to describe hemisphere CBF and perfusion heterogeneity. Cerebral perfusion significantly decreased in SAH group (CCR:1.382+/-0.192, RD:0.417+/-0.015) compared to sham group (CCR:1.988+/-0.346, RD 0.389+/-0.015) (p<0.05). However, cerebral perfusion was not significantly improved in Nimodipine+SAH group (CCR: 1.503+/-0.107, RD: 0.425+/-0.018) compared to SAH group (p>0.05). The topical administration of nimodipine may not significantly improve CBF following SAH, even our previous data shows that topical administration of nimodipine significantly alleviates cerebral vasospasm following SAH. The possible mechanisms need further investigation.
