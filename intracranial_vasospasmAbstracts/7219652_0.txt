Cerebral vasospasm is caused by many factors. Primarily it is caused by Noradrenalin (NA) localised in the vessel walls and by platelet aggregation, with raising of the concentration of 5-HT in the intima. Its prolongation is based on blood breakdown products and or biochemical disturbances of brain metabolism. The most potent vasoconstrictors are acting through the vessel's own receptors (Serotonin, NE, Histamin), so the most effective therapy is based on the contractile system of the vessel. By blocking the alpha-receptors by Phenoxybenzamine, blockade of the Phosphodiesterase by Papaverin, Euphyllin to raise the concentration of cAMP and stimulation of Adenyl-Cyclase-System by beta-stimulation, it is possible to get good results in the treatment of cerebral arterial vasospasm.
