To investigate the alteration of endothelium-dependent responses in chronic vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), experiments were carried out in the double-hemorrhage canine model. After the presence of vasospasm was confirmed by cerebral angiography on Days 0 and 7, pharmacological studies on the basilar artery were conducted in vitro on Day 8. In the SAH group, endothelium-dependent relaxation was abolished in response to arginine vasopressin and was significantly reduced in response to thrombin. Endothelium-independent relaxation in the SAH group was preserved in response to papaverine and was minimally reduced in response to sodium nitroprusside. Endothelium-dependent contraction in response to arachidonic acid, acetylcholine, the calcium ionophore A23187, adenosine diphosphate, mechanical stretching, and hypoxia persisted in the SAH group. The maximal contraction to KCl and uridine triphosphate, which is endothelium-independent, was diminished in the SAH group, but not changes in sensitivity were noted in the concentration-response relationships. A significant correlation was observed between the degree of vasospasm determined angiographically and the loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation. The loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation and the persistence of endothelium-dependent contraction suggest that the deterioration in the endothelium-dependent responses may be an important component in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm.
