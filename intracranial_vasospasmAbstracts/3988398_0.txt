Red cell deformability was compared between two groups with and without severe cerebral vasospasm. The results obtained revealed that deformability was decreased in the former as compared to the latter. Pentoxifylline, an ameliorant of microcirculation, also demonstrated the tendency to improve deformability in the case of vasospasm. But improving efficacy for clinical manifestations could not be met only by virtue of such a change while favorable.
