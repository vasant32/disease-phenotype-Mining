A 32-year-old woman had a history of left temporal and occipital bone defects since her infancy and she developed left exophthalmos in the last three years following a ormin head injury. The left eye ball was displaced downward and rotated nasally, and she was unable to move the left eye voluntarily beyond the mid-line. The left eye ball could not be rotated beyond the mid-line even by muscle traction. Skull x-rays and carotid angiograms showed various abnormalities of skull dysplasia and positional abnormalities of intracranial arteries. Pneumoencephalography demonstrated dilatation of the arterior and temoral horns of the left lateral ventricle. Cranioplasty was performed and postoperative vasospasm occurred in the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries, causing right hemiparesis and aphasia. Congenital vascular abnormality in neurofibromatosis was discussed in relation to the cerebral vasospasm.
