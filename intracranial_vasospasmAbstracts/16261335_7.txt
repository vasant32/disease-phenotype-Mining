We describe two patients with symptomatic vasospasms after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who were successfully treated with intraarterial injection of colforsin daropate hydrochloride (HCl). Colforsin daropate HCl is capable of directly stimulating adenylate cyclase, which in turn causes vasorelaxation via elevated intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. We suggest that colforsin daropate HCl might be a useful therapeutic tool in treating cerebral vasospasm.
