Electron microscopic data on the development of myonecrosis following cerebral vasospasm associated with subarachnoid haemorrhage, meningitis and trans-sylvian surgery are presented. The basic feature of myonecrosis was dissolution of myofilaments with resultant fine granular or filamentous material. The disintegrating cytoplasm often contained numerous glycogen granules, dense bodies, autophagic vacuoles and myelin-like membranous bodies. A well-developed sarcoplasmic reticulum was preserved despite myofilament dissolution, while mitochondria showed marked swelling. The nuclei showed either dilution of chromatin or pyknotic change. The basal lamina was remarkably thickened and maintained an irregular outline of the necrotic smooth muscle cells. Enlarged intercellular space contained abundant cellular debris, vesicular structures and connective tissue fibres. The pathogenesis of these changes is discussed.
