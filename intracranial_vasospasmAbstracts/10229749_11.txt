BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The noninvasive diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm with the use of conventional transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) is based on a velocity study of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The authors report a prospective comparative study between transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS), conventional transcranial Doppler (TCD), and angiography in the diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm after surgical treatment for aneurysm. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients underwent routine angiography after surgical treatment for intracranial aneurysm. The distribution of vasospasm was determined after a prospective calculation of the angiographic diameter of the MCA, internal carotid artery (ICA), and anterior cerebral artery (ACA). The blood flow velocities (systolic and maximum) of the MCA, ICA, and ACA were evaluated by TCCS and TCD. RESULTS: The correlation between mean maximum velocity and angiographic diameter was significant for the MCA (r=-0.637, P<0.0001), ICA (r=-0.676, P<0.0001), and ACA (r=-0.425, P<0.01). TCCS sensitivity and specificity were higher than those for TCD for MCA (100% and 93%, respectively) and ICA (100% and 96.6%, respectively). For ACA, the sensitivity and specificity were 71.4% and 84.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that TCCS is useful for accurate monitoring of cerebral vasospasm in the MCA and ICA. In the ACA, TCCS monitors the hemodynamic state of the anterior part of the circle of Willis, which could expose the patient to a delayed ischemic deficit.
