Thromboxane, a highly vasoactive substance, is found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients and experimental animals following subarachnoid haemorrhage. A stable synthetic analogue of thromboxane A2 was administered intracisternally in rabbits. This resulted in an increase in endothelial permeability of the major cerebral arteries to Evans Blue dye and horseradish peroxidase. Thromboxane may be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm and may be related to the contrast enhancement of the arteries in the basal cisterns on CT scans of patients who are prone to develop arterial narrowing.
