A review of 36 interictal EEGs compatible with the diagnosis of benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS) was made in this study. These children constituted 31% of the children with focal epileptic EEG activity observed in the same period. The dipolic spikes occurred either as a single focus (78%) or as two independent foci with a greater preponderance to the right (22%). The onset of seizures before the age of 5 years (Group I) is 53% and between 6 and 10 years (Group II) is 47%. Clinical evaluation showed that 60% of the patients in Group I and 75% in Group II had lateralized seizures, although all of them were initially diagnosed as nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures. A follow-up study showed 31% complete recovery, 47% seizure-free under medications, 8% occasional seizures, 8% frequent seizures, and the rest 6% had a single seizure without medication. It is therefore concluded that the syndrome is common in Saudi Arabia and is usually unrecognized by the general physicians. The follow-up of our patients so far confirms the excellent prognosis.
