A considerable proportion of children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) have increasingly been found to show neuropsychiatric deficits such as cognitive impairment and impulsivity, possibly associated with frontal lobe dysfunctions. We performed 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based brain volumetry to characterize serial changes in frontal and prefrontal lobe volumes and compare volumetric changes with clinical symptoms. Serial changes in regional cerebral volumes were measured in a 5-year-old boy with BCECTS. Seizures were not easily controlled, and he demonstrated oromotor deficits, cognitive impairments and behavioral problems. Cognitive and behavioral deficits persisted even after remission of seizure disorder and oromotor deficits. Two BCECTS patients (5-6 years old) without neuropsychological disorders served as typical BCECTS, and nine normal subjects (4-10 years old) served as controls. Volumes of the frontal and prefrontal lobes were determined using a workstation, and prefrontal to frontal lobe volume ratio was calculated. Frontal and prefrontal lobe volumes showed no growth even after remission of seizure disorders. Prefrontal to frontal lobe volume ratio reduced slightly even after remission of both seizure disorders and EEG abnormalities. The result suggests that BCECTS presenting with atypical course may be associated with frontal lobe dysfunction resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits.
