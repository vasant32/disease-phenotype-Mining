Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is a common disorder in childhood. After a brief overview of BECTS, a review of the data in favor of treatment with anticonvulsant medications is followed by the data indicating that treatment is not indicated. Some children appear to have cognitive consequences from BECTS. The parents and children with BECTS require a full discussion of the pros and cons of treatment, but based on data available at this time, it is concluded that treatment is generally not indicated for most patients. Future research may lead to changes in the recommendations.
