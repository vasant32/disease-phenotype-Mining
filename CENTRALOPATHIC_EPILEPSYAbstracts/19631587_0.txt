The relationship between educational problems and clinical/electroencephalographic aspects was assessed in 38 children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS). Children were assessed using the School Performance Test; questionnaires on learning difficulties administered to parents and teachers; the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition; and EEGs. Absolute and relative amplitudes in the classic bands (quantitative EEG) and characteristics of epileptiform activity on the EEG were examined. Educational problems were observed in 7 (18.4%) children with BECTS. In this subgroup, relative alpha amplitudes at the central and parietal electrodes were lower as compared with those of the BECTS subgroup with normal educational performance and a control group matched for age, gender, and socioeconomic status. The data indicated a possible relationship between alterations in background brain electrical activity and the tendency toward inferior educational performance in children with BECTS. This study suggested that quantitative EEGs are a possible physiological tool in the assessment of cognitive aspects in children with BECTS.
