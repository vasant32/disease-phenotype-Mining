In 41 patients with EEG features of benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECCT), we noted associated generalized spike-wave discharges (GSWD) in 14.6% and multiple independent sharp wave foci in 9.8%. The presence or absence of these EEG features was not predictive of the clinical course. The high incidence of GSWD in children with BECCT suggests a possible relation in the expression of these two EEG traits.
