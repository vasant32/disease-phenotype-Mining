OBJECTIVES: We report the analysis of scalp topography and dipole modeling of the rolandic spikes in 6 patients suffering of benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood with extremely high amplitude SEP by tapping stimulation of the finger of the hand. METHODS: EEG and BESA analysis were performed for both rolandic spontaneous interictal spikes and high amplitude scalp activity evoked by tapping and electrical stimulation of the first finger of the right hand. RESULTS: The evoked responses showed a morphology characterized by a rapid phase (spike) followed by a slow phase (slow wave). The spike presented an early small positive component followed by a main negative component. Similar morphology, dipole configuration and source localization were observed for both rolandic spikes and evoked high amplitude scalp responses. Dipole localization showed an overlap of spatial coordinates between rolandic and evoked spikes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the extremely high amplitude SEPs could be evoked spikes which probably had the same cortical generators of the spontaneous rolandic spikes.
