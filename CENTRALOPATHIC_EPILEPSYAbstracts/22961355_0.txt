 PURPOSE: Epilepsy and migraine frequently show a clinical overlap. An increase in number of electroencephalographic abnormalities, such as centro-temporal spikes (CTS), may be observed in patients suffering from migraine, epileptic abnormalities that are typically in benign epilepsy of childhood with CTS (BECTS). The aim of this study is to better define the role of CTS in children with migraine compared to children with BECTS, in relation with their neuropsychological profile. METHODS: Thirty-two children were enrolled and divided into three groups on the basis of their diagnosis: 16 children (eight males and eight females, aged 12.3 ± 2.58 years) affected by BECTS, 8 patients (four males and four females, aged 11.8 ± 3.47 years) affected by BECTS and migraine, and 8 children (four males and four females, aged 13.5 ± 1.79 years) affected by migraine showing CTS abnormalities. A cognitive and neuropsychological assessment was performed, using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-third edition and NEPSY II, in all patients. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A similar neuropsychological impairment was found in patients affected by BECTS and in those affected by BECTS and migraine; a significant deficit in short- and long-term verbal memory was evident in patients affected by migraine and CTS. CTS in patients with migraine can influence the neuropsychological tests, with a possible negative impact on language and learning development.
