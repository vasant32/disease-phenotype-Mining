INTRODUCTION: Rolandic epilepsy is the most common epileptic syndrome in infancy. It usually has a favourable prognosis and seizures disappear during the teenage years. AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe a sample of children diagnosed with rolandic epilepsy in clinical, electrophysiological and imaging terms. We also intend to compare the results obtained with those described in the literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study of the children diagnosed with rolandic epilepsy who had been submitted to a follow-up at the Neuropaediatrics Unit at the HGSA since 1989. Children who were less than 2 years old when they suffered their first seizures or who had abnormal neurological/imaging examinations were excluded. Two groups were defined (typical and atypical), several variables were characterised and these were then analysed statistically. RESULTS: A total of 87 children (51 males) were included in this study, their mean age being 13.6 years. The population was divided into two groups: A (typical cases; n = 69) and B (atypical cases; n = 18). The mean age at the onset of seizures was 6.2 and 6 years for groups A and B, respectively. The predominant type of seizures was simple partial for group A and complex partial for group B; they were mainly sporadic and nocturnal in both groups. Medication was administered to 51 (73.9%) of the children in group A, with a good response in 78.4% of them; 13 members of group B (72.2%) received medication, with a positive response in 76.9% of them. CONCLUSIONS: Rolandic epilepsy has a broad clinical spectrum and usually courses with normal psychomotor development, but may coexist with learning disabilities. In this study, no significant differences were found between the typical and atypical forms of presentation, as far as their progress and response to treatment are concerned.
