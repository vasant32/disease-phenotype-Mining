Benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS) is a form of focal idiopathic epilepsy, with seizure remission by the age of 18. Recent studies have suggested that some children with BECTS can suffer from deficits of memory, attention and learning ability and in auditory-verbal and performance sub-tests. On the other hand, alterations in the baseline brain electrical activity determined by using the quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) have been described. The objective of this study was to evaluate the absolute and relative powers in the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands of the qEEG in children with BECTS, and their relation to IQ measurements (WISC-III). Twenty-six 8 to 11-year-old children with BECTS were studied, paired with a control group of healthy children according to age and gender. It was shown that the absolute delta and theta powers were statistically greater in the children with BECTS than in the control group, at almost all the electrodes. In the children with BECTS, a negative correlation (Pearson's correlation test) was observed at various electrodes between the absolute delta and theta powers and the performance IQ. These data indicate a possible relationship between maturational disturbance in the brain electrical activity development and the tendency for inferior cognitive performance in children with BECTS.
