We report the case of a 5-year-old boy, first referred in 1995, with benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS) with proximal negative myoclonus as the only seizure type who experienced severe aggravation of seizures when lamotrigine (25 mg/d) was prescribed in association to valproate (400 mg/d). Lamotrigine was stopped and progressively the drops of the legs disappeared within 6 months but valproate was continued. The overall prognosis was benign, confirmed by long-term follow-up until age 20, inkeeping with the diagnosis of BECTS. There was a clear relationship between introduction of lamotrigine and the detrimental effect and the condition improved dramatically when lamotrigine was stopped. Thus lamotrigine may aggravate BECTS in certain conditions and should be used with proper care in this indication.
