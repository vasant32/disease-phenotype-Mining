INTRODUCTION: Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome, or bilateral anterior opercular syndrome, is characterised by facio-pharyngo-glosso-masticatory diplegia with 'automatic-voluntary dissociation', which consists in the abolition of voluntary movements while involuntary movements and reflexes are preserved. It is produced by bilateral involvement of the anterior or frontal opercular region. In adults it is related to ischemic lesions. In childhood it presents congenitally in perisylvian dysplasias and as an acquired disorder in encephalitis or can be episodic in symptomatic or idiopathic epilepsies such as benign rolandic epilepsy. CASE REPORT: A 13-year-old patient who presented, over five straight days, four episodes of facial dysplegia, anarthria, dysphagia, drooling, paralysis of the upper limbs, while involuntary facial expression was normal and the corneal, cough and gag reflexes were preserved. The first three come to an end spontaneously at 2, 4 and 20 hours, respectively; the fourth episode concluded an hour and a half after onset, following administration of intravenous phenytoin for 5 minutes. Computerised axial tomography and magnetic resonance images of the brain, as well as the interictal electroencephalograms (EEG), were normal. Administration of oxcarbazepine was started but at 8 months was stopped after a normal EEG during nocturnal sleep was obtained. After 15 months, the patient has not presented any more episodes. CONCLUSIONS: The paroxysmal character of the disorder together with normal interictal periods, the normality of the neuroimages, and the speedy recovery achieved after the administration of phenytoin support the notion of an epileptic origin. We believe that we are dealing with a bilateral anterior opercular syndrome due to a non-convulsive epileptic state, compatible with the presentation of benign rolandic epilepsy.
