Topographic EEG investigation with instant voltage mapping showed maximal negativity of "Rolandic" spikes over central or midtemporal electrodes with spread to parietal or upper frontal areas with a dipol formation (centro-temporal negativity, frontal positivity). Spike amplitude or duration was not correlated with spread to adjacent areas. No other focal abnormalities, such as focal slowing, occurred. Spike activity was pronounced during light sleep and was often associated with generalized spike wave activity, which is more likely to be a sign of functional disturbance rather than the sequelae of brain damage. A review of literature shows that this pattern is helpful in the differentiation from focal abnormalities due to brain lesions.
