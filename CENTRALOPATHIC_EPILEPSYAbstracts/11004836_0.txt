Two cases of auditory disturbance caused by carbamazepine are reported. Patient 1, a 9-year-old boy with benign Rolandic epilepsy, developed impairment of pitch perception one day after administration of carbamazepine. Patient 2, a 33-year-old female with glossopharyngeal neuralgia, developed impairment of pitch perception several hours after administration of carbamazepine, complaining that the perceived sounds became lower than previously by a semitone. Her pitch perception recovered soon after the cessation of carbamazepine. The carbamazepine-induced disturbance in pitch perception may be more frequent than we guess.
