The purpose of this study was to clarify the neurophysiologic basis of oromotor deficits in a patient with atypical rolandic epilepsy. We investigated magnetoencephalographic analysis of rolandic discharges with right predominance before and during clonazepam therapy. Before clonazepam administration, current sources of rolandic discharges were broadly distributed in the secondary sensory cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and parietal association area in addition to hand and orofacial division of the primary somatosensory cortex. During clonazepam therapy, oromotor deficits were improved, along with a decrease in rolandic discharge, and current sources of residual right-sided rolandic discharges were shifted to the right superior parietal lobule. Taking the clinical course and magnetoencephalographic findings together, the distributed rolandic discharge focus might be closely related to oromotor deficits, and clonazepam was effective for the disorder.
