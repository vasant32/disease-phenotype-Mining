We characterized the neuropsychological status of children with newly diagnosed idiopathic childhood epilepsy and measured differences in IQ between children with different types of epilepsy. The Korean Education Development Institute-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (KEDI-WISC) was administered to 72 patients (35 males and 37 females), of mean age 8.7Â±2.6 years, with newly diagnosed idiopathic childhood epilepsy. Of these patients, 22 (30.6%) had generalized epilepsy, 48 (66.7%) localization-related epilepsy, and 2 (2.8%) mixed epilepsy. Children with generalized epilepsy and benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BCECTS) were of similar verbal IQ and full-scale IQ, although performance IQ was significantly lower in patients with generalized epilepsy. Among children with BCECTS, those with unilateral spikes had higher full-scale and performance IQ scores than those with bilateral spikes. Follow-up studies on large numbers of patients are needed to determine the effects of epilepsy per se, and antiepileptic drugs, on intelligence.
