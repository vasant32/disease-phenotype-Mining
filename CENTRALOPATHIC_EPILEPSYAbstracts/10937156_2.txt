We report the case of a child with benign partial epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECT) in whom protrusion of the tongue stopped the interictal abnormalities, and describe the polygraphic EEG recording of a seizure which terminated upon voluntary protrusion of the tongue. We mention the close link between the post-central (somatosensory) cortex and pre-central (motor) cortex, and how the primary sensory area has direct access to the motor cortex. We also examine how a tactile stimulus may provoke the inhibition of an epileptic discharge.
