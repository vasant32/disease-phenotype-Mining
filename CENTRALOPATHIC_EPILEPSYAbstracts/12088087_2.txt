The purpose of this research was to publish a complete ictal electroencephalographic (EEG) record of a child with benign centrotemporal epilepsy. The record includes a brief description of the patient's epilepsy syndrome, analysis of interictal and ictal EEG records, and a description of corresponding clinical ictal events. Ictal EEG activity appeared over the right rolandic cortex and spread to adjacent sites. Initial rhythmic activity was followed by bilateral series of sharply contoured slow waves. The electric field of the seizure discharge changed during the seizure. Tangentially oriented dipolar field was found in the middle part of the seizure. Evolution of clinical seizure phenomena roughly corresponded to propagation of the ictal discharge. In terms of topography and electromorphology, this ictal record was similar but not completely identical with those reported previously. Collection of further ictal records in benign rolandic or centrotemporal epilepsy of childhood and other epilepsy syndromes is necessary.
