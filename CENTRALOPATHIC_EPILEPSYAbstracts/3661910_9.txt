Factors useful to predict seizure frequency and duration of antiepileptic treatment of children with benign partial epilepsy and rolandic spikes were retrospectively evaluated in 72 patients seizure-free for at least 5 years and off antiepileptic drugs for at least 2 years. Three groups were considered: Group I, 11 patients (15%) with a single seizure: Group II, 40 patients (56%) with 2 to 6 seizures; Group III, 21 patients (29%) with over 6 seizures. Significant predictors of rare seizure frequency were: presence of convulsive generalized seizures as the sole ictal manifestation, found in 17 patients of Group II and in one patient of Group III (p less than 0.001), and longer average interval between first and second seizure in Group II than in Group III (7.8 months versus 3.5 months, p less than 0.0001). Although the average duration of the disease was significantly shorter in Group II than in Group III (1.5 years versus 4.5 years, p less than 0.00001), the duration of the antiepileptic treatment was similar in both groups. Of the 8 untreated patients, 5 had a single seizure and one had 2 seizures. Therefore, it is suggested that antiepileptic treatment be delayed without risk until the third seizure occurrence and restricted to patients with no predictor of rare seizure recurrence.
