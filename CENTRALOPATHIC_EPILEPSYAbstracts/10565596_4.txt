A girl aged 5 years developed nocturnal seizures (mouth twitching, salivation, anarthria, with right arm jerking and occasional secondary generalisation), with frequent focal sharp waves over the left centrotemporal region in her EEG, suggesting benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS). Seizures became diurnal and frequent, not modified by carbamazepine (CBZ) or valproate (VPA) but responding to VPA and lamotrigine (LTG) with recommended dosage schedules for this combination. Her school performance then deteriorated insidiously, with poor memory and concentration, clumsiness, stuttering, and emotional lability. After 4 months, new episodes, < or =10 per day, occurred. These lasted a few seconds; she stared into space, her jaw dropped, her head dropped to the right, and her eyelids flickered. She usually maintained awareness. Attacks were often provoked by blowing or sneezing. Ictal EEG showed anterior-predominant 3/s sharp-slow wave complexes lasting < or =8 s, with bilateral rolandic discharges interictally. Withdrawal of LTG resulted in rapid improvement in cognitive function and gradual remission of the new attacks. CONCLUSIONS: This appears to be a paradoxic reaction to LTG in the setting of BECTS.
