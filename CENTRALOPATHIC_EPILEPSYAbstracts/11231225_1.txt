Hippocampal and/or white matter abnormalities have been found on the MRIs in 10/18 children with typical rolandic epilepsy. The etiology of the first-mentioned is not evident, whereas the latter may be a result of a maturational delay involving a defective myelination. Both abnormalities may cause cognitive dysfunction. In order to get a better understanding of rolandic epilepsy both MRI and neuropsychological studies are wanted in groups of children with typical rolandic seizures with and without rolandic sharp waves, as well as in groups of children with typical rolandic sharp waves and atypical seizures.
