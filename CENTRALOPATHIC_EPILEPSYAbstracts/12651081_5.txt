Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), also known as benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) of childhood represents 15% of all childhood epilepsies [Handbook of Epilepsy Treatment (2000)]. A majority of these patients do no require treatment; however, in those cases where treatment is justified, the most efficacious medication with a benign safety profile should be selected. We present three clinical cases of otherwise healthy children with BECTS who were treated only with levetiracetam. All three of these children remain seizure-free and are experiencing no reported side effects.
