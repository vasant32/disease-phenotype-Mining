Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common type of childhood focal epilepsy. Although there is no intellectual deficit, children with RE may have specific cognitive impairments. The aims of this study were to identify changes in executive functions in children with RE and to verify the influence of epilepsy and seizure variables. We evaluated 25 children with RE and 28 healthy controls. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was utilized. The results showed that the RE children had worse performance than the control group in some categories of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the Trail Making Test part B, and the Verbal Fluency Test (FAS). Children with earlier onset of epilepsy had worse performance when compared with children with later onset of epilepsy. We conclude that children with RE may show a deficit in executive function despite their normal IQ. The set of tests was more extensive than what was previously used in other studies. Our study suggests that early seizures can interfere with brain development. Regarding cognition, the term benign should be used cautiously in RE.
