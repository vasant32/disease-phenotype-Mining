We studied clinical-EEG features of 63 children, age range of 2-14 years, with occipital epileptiform activity in the EEG, with epileptic seizures and no evidences of brain damage. Age at onset was between 1-12 years. In 15 cases the seizures last for more than 30 min up to 6 h. Seizures occurred during sleep in 28 children. Autonomic symptoms were apparent in 25, head deviation in 24 and hemiconvulsion or generalization in 17 cases. Ten children reported visual symptoms. In 14 children the seizures were exclusively generalised convulsions. Spikes were observed in 27 cases and spike and slow-wave complex in 36. Discharges blocking by eyes opening were confirmed in 15 cases. Somatosensory evoked spikes by foot stimulation were observed in 9.5% cases. The cases were classified in the following idiopathic epileptic syndromes: early-onset occipital -- Panayiotopoulos-type (EOO), 32 cases; late-onset occipital -- Gastaut type (LOO), 8; rolandic epilepsy in 7. CONCLUSION: EOO occurred more frequently than LOO. Idiopathic occipital syndromes diagnosis was possible in 63.4% of the cases.
