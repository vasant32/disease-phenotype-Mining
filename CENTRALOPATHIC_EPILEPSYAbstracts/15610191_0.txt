 PURPOSE: To study factors associated with discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and symptomatic/cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy (S/CLRE) METHODS: For the IGE study, 71 patients who were able to discontinue their AED (discontinued-IGE group) were compared to 71 patients who continued AED therapy (continued-IGE group) and 20 patients with seizure relapse after discontinuing AED (relapsed-IGE group). For S/CLRE, 90 patients who were able to discontinue AED (discontinued-S/CLRE group) were compared to 90 patients who continued AED (continued-S/CLRE group) and 76 patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes who were able to discontinue AED (discontinued-BECTS group). RESULTS: Compared to the continued-IGE group, the discontinued-IGE group showed a weaker seizure propensity, better response to AEDs, more frequent epileptiform discharge suppression, and lower frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCs). Compared to the relapse-IGE group, the discontinued-IGE group had more frequent epileptiform discharge suppression. The discontinued-S/CLRE group showed a weaker seizure propensity, better response to AEDs, more frequent epileptiform discharge suppression, and less frequent symptomatic signs compared to the continued-S/C LRE group. Notably, the age at epilepsy onset was not a critical factor for discontinuing AEDs in both IGE and S/CLRE. Although the discontinued-S/CLRE group had more frequent symptomatic signs, older age at epilepsy onset and less frequent epileptiform discharge suppression than the discontinued-BECTS group, no difference was found in seizure propensity and response to AEDs between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Seizure propensity, epileptiform discharge, and response to AEDs should be considered to predict the possibility of terminating AED therapy in IGE or S/CLRE. In addition, attention should be paid to seizure pattern in IGE and symptomatic signs in LRE.
