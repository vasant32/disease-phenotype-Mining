INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Advances in genetics, techniques for diagnosis and treatment, and increasing concern for the quality of life and neuropsychological aspects of epileptic children and the possible repercussions of treatment lead to changes in the approach to epilepsy and require continual adaptation. In this study we analysed a series of cases of idiopathic and cryptogenic epilepsy attended by the Neuropaediatric Department of the Hospital Miguel Servet in Zaragoza (Spain). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the cases diagnosed as having idiopathic or cryptogenic epilepsy between May 1990 and December 1999. RESULTS: We assessed 4,507 children. In 1,794 (39.8%) consultation was for a paroxystic disorder. Epilepsy was diagnosed in 466 children (10.3%) and 103 cases were considered possibly or probably epilepsy but the diagnosis remains in doubt (2.3%). In 111 cases (23.8%) the epilepsy was considered idiopathic, in 122 (26.2%) cryptogenic and in 233 cases (50%) symptomatic. The following epileptic syndromes were identified: epilepsy-absence attacks in 28 cases (6%), benign myoclonic infantile epilepsy in 4 cases, other idiopathic generalized epilepsies in 61 cases (13%), benign Rolandic epilepsy in 18 cases (3.9%), 2 cases of cryptogenic Ohtahara syndrome, 6 cases of cryptogenic West syndrome, 1 severe case of infantile myoclonic epilepsy, 1 case of continuous wave epilepsy during slow eye movement sleep and 1 case of Landau-Kleffner syndrome. CONCLUSION: Current requirements and the rate of advances in epilepsy make it essential for neuropaediatric teams to include experts in epilepsy.
