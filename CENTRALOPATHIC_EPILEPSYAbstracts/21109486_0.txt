 OBJECTIVE: Peri-rolandic spikes are typically seen in benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes. However, some cases of epilepsy with peri-rolandic spikes manifest with medical intractability or cognitive dysfunction. The present study evaluated whether spike source localization is predictive of different prognosis of epilepsy and/or cognitive function. METHODS: The localization of peri-rolandic spikes was compared between 6 patients whose seizure remitted under age of 15 years with no cognitive impairment (benign group) and 6 patients with either intractable epilepsy or cognitive dysfunction (non-benign group). The sources of epileptic spikes were approximated by the single equivalent current dipole (ECD) model using whole-head magnetoencephalography. RESULTS: The spike locations in the benign group were significantly lateral (14.8±5.3 versus 5.3±3.3 mm, p<0.05), anterior (11.6±2.1 versus 3.7±4.8 mm, p<0.01), and inferior (27.7±3.6 versus 12.0±10.0 mm, p<0.01) to those in the non-benign group. Seizures tended to involve the laryngo-pharyngo-oro-facial area in the benign group and the facial-hand-foot area in the non-benign group. CONCLUSION: The clear difference in spike dipole location between benign group and non-benign groups. SIGNIFICANCE: Spike localization may be useful for predicting prognosis in epilepsy with sensorimotor seizures and spikes along with central sulcus.
