OBJECTIVE: To localize the irritative zone in children by combined spike-related fMRI and EEG multiple source analysis (MSA) in children with benign rolandic epilepsy. METHODS: Interictal spikes were averaged and localized using MSA, and source locations were displayed in the anatomical 3D-MRI in 11 patients (5-12 yrs, median 10). Interictal spikes were additionally recorded during the fMRI acquisition (EEG-fMRI), and the fMRI sequences were correlated off-line with the EEG spikes. RESULTS: MSA revealed an initial central dipole in all patients, including the face or hand area. A second dipolar source was mostly consistent with propagated activity. BOLD activations from EEG-fMRI, consistent with the locations of the initial dipoles, were found in four patients. We found additional large areas of BOLD activations in 3 of these subjects extending into the sylvian fissure and the insula. These were identified as propagated activity by MSA using the short time differences in the source waveforms. CONCLUSIONS: MSA provided reliable localization of the spike onset zone in all children with benign rolandic epilepsy. Using the combination of EEG-fMRI and MSA we were able to discriminate the spike onset zone from propagated epileptiform source activity, using the spatial resolution of the EEG-fMRI technique and the temporal resolution of the MSA. However, the sensitivity of the EEG-fMRI technique was low and further improvements of the technique are warranted. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that a combination of EEG-fMRI and MSA may be a powerful tool to describe the irritative zone of patients with idiopathic focal epilepsies. Clinical studies in patients with non-idiopathic focal epilepsies may clarify whether both techniques can be used as complementary clinical tools to localize the onset of interictal epileptic activity in focal epilepsies.
