Forty-four patients with rolandic epilepsy (32 boys, 12 girls), aged from 5 to 14 years, were examined in the prospective study during 5 years. Before the antiepileptic treatment, most of patients had transitory cognitive disturbances. There were the impairment of verbal functions, especially verbal intellect, while non-verbal intellect remained intact; dyspraxia, impairment of auditory-speech memory, disturbances of arbitrary regulation and optical-motor coordination. The cognitive impairment was not severe and did not impact on learning of school program. No significant correlations were found between the lateralization of regional EEG changes and the character of cognitive dysfunction though the age-related lateralization of the focal epileptiform activity was shown: the right-side localization of central-temporal EEG spikes predominated in children at the age of 6.29 +/- 0.9 years, the left-side localization - in children at the age of 8.4 +/- 1.4 years. The clinical remission was achieved 4-5 years earlier than the recovery of cognitive functions. Valproates used as monotherapy or in the combination with ethosuximidum and levetiracetam were drugs of choice.
