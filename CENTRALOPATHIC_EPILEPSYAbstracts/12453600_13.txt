The occurrence of seizures in patients with fragile X syndrome (Fra-X) is reported. Among the 30 patients, six had epilepsy that was particularly severe and two also showed atypical facial dysmorphism that was different from that seen in classical Fra-X. From the study performed in this series of Fra-X patients the authors arrived at the following conclusions. (1) The occurrence of seizures in Fra-X population is around 20%, as reported in the literature. (2) The EEG pattern of benign childhood epilepsy with central-temporal spikes (BCECTS) was found in only three patients (10%). (3) According to the pattern of seizures and EEGs, four groups may be recognizable, the less frequent being the uncommon group characterized by severe epilepsy unresponsive to treatment. (4) In this group atypical facial dysmorphism (although not similar in the two patients and different from the classical facial pattern of Fra-X) was found. The authors maintain that additional genetic factors might influence the clinical course and neurological aspects of Fra-X syndrome.
