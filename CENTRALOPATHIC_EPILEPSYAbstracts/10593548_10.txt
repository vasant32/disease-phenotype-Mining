The effects of antiepileptic drugs on cognition are difficult to delineate, yet of critical importance for children with epilepsy. We investigated the cognitive and behavioral effects of carbamazepine in children with benign rolandic epilepsy. Ten subjects with benign rolandic epilepsy were evaluated with and without carbamazepine treatment. Fourteen unmedicated subjects with migraine headache evaluated twice served as a control group. Subjects were 6 to 12 years of age, fluent in English, and not mentally retarded. We found that children with benign rolandic epilepsy were quicker on a visual-search task and recalled stories better when not treated than when treated with carbamazepine. After correction for multiple comparisons only the memory finding remained significant. Higher carbamazepine serum level was associated with slower performance on the same visual-search task. This latter finding did not meet multiple comparison criteria. Numerous significant practice effects were found within the control group. Comparisons with reliable change indices identified two subjects with benign rolandic epilepsy with particularly poor scores while receiving carbamazepine. These findings suggest some effects on memory from carbamazepine; however, they do not support meaningful dosage-related effects, within the recommended range. Significant practice effects confirmed the need to control for such effects when evaluating treatments. Finally, identification of two subjects who performed more poorly while on carbamazepine suggests that some children might experience particular difficulties while receiving this medication and highlights the need to investigate individual subject responses to treatment.
