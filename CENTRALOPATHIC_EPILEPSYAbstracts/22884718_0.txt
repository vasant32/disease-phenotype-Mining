The molecular pathogenesis of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) remains unclear whereas mutations of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes have been identified as causes of benign familial neonatal convulsions. We report here a girl with benign neonatal convulsions followed by BECTS, for whom a mutation of KCNQ2 was identified. This case may provide the clue to the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of BECTS.
