The purpose of this study was to determine if reduction in spike frequency in children with benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes treated with sulthiame correlates with improved neuropsychologic function. Six untreated children (5 boys, 1 girl) with a mean (standard deviation) age of 9.1 years (1.5 years) underwent overnight ambulatory electroencephalograph recording and neuropsychologic evaluation at baseline and after 6 months of sulthiame monotherapy. The Reliable Change Index was used to determine whether a statistically reliable change in neuropsychologic function occurred. All children continued receiving sulthiame monotherapy (dose range, 8.0-9.3 mg/kg per day) for the study period without further seizures. Although spike frequency was reduced in all 6 children (3 showing a decrease to less than 10% of baseline), they all demonstrated significant deterioration in their reading ability, 5 had significant declines in general memory, and more than half had reduction in attention skills and mathematics ability. Although sulthiame was effective at seizure control and significantly reduced spike frequency in children, it was also associated with deterioration in cognitive function.
