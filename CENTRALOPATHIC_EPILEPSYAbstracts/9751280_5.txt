We performed a spike topography study and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a female patient with benign rolandic epilepsy presenting single high-amplitude evoked spikes in response to somatosensory peripheral stimulation. The stimulus was delivered to the first finger of the right hand using a tendon hammer, which evoked a single spike followed by a slow wave, showing the maximal amplitude over the left central regions. fMRI showed that the contralateral sensory cortices (S1 and S2) and the motor cortex (M I) were activated during tapping stimulation. In 3 normal subjects, tapping stimulation produced no fMRI activation. This fMRI study documents a highly focal activation of sensorimotor areas related to subclinical evoked spikes in benign rolandic epilepsy.
