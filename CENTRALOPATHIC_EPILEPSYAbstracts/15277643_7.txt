The authors describe a paradoxical reaction to lamotrigine (LTG) treatment in a patient with idiopathic rolandic epilepsy characterized by seizure deterioration, the appearance of new seizure type, and transient cognitive impairment. This phenomenon was present at a low dose after a slow titration and promptly reverted on LTG discontinuation. This rare event may have similarities with carbamazepine-induced seizure worsening caused by the Na++ channel inhibitory effect of the two antiepileptic drugs.
