Cases with a clinical and electroencephalographic phenotype of benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) in association with a proven organic brain lesion have rarely been reported.

Our case bolsters the argument that in at least some cases, BECTS is associated with organic brain disease.
