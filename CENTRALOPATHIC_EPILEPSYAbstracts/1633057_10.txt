To assess the clinical applicability of dipole tracing in childhood epilepsy, the location and stability of electric source generator of focal spikes seen in EEG of epileptic children were investigated using this method. The patients were divided into 3 groups; benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECS, Group A, n = 14), other types of epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (Group B, n = 15) and epilepsy with focal spikes in other areas (Group C, n = 13). The spike dipole in each group was analyzed using dipole tracing method. The following results were obtained. (1) The spikes of BCECS were characterized by constantly stable dipoles, compared to those of the other types of childhood epilepsy. The spikes of epileptic children with mental retardation mostly lacked the stability of dipoles. These seemed to suggest that the stability of dipoles was closely related to the prognosis and pathophysiology of epilepsy. (2) The dipoles of BCECS were localized strictly in the Rolandic area. Dipole tracing from EEG spikes was considered to contribute to the elucidation of the pathophysiology of childhood epilepsy.
