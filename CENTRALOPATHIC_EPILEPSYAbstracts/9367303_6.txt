An 8 year-old girl presented with simple facial motor seizures. Although the electroencephalogram (EEG) demonstrated left hemisphere centrotemporal spikes with features consistent with benign rolandic epilepsy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated a left hemisphere focal cortical dysplasia. MRI-assisted EEG dipole analysis of the spikes suggested that the rolandic fissure rather than the focal cortical dysplasia was the origin of the epileptic spike discharge. This noninvasive method may be a useful adjunct in evaluation of some patients with epilepsy and focal superficial cerebral lesions.
