Benign Rolandic epilepsy (BRE) and primary generalized epilepsy (PGE) are found at about the same period of childhood. Crossover from PGE to BRE and vice versa may occur; two short case reports provide further evidence for this development. Hence, transitions from a primarily generalized to a focal (partial) epileptic seizure disorder and vice versa is a possibility. Both PGE and BRE are based upon states of hyperexcitability, i.e. dysfunctional rather than structural abnormalities that are capable of changing their spatial distribution.
