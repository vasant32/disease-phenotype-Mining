In order to determine the borderlines of the benign partial epilepsy of children with centrotemporal spike foci ('Rolandic epilepsy') 43 patients with epilepsy and spike foci in the centrotemporal region or elsewhere drawn from the EEG files were re-evaluated as adults. The prognosis was equally good whether the spike focus was in the centrotemporal region or elsewhere, and synchronous paroxystic activity did not make the prognosis worse, but focal temporal low frequency activity did. It is suggested that borderline cases exist between 'Rolandic epilepsy' and other age dependent epilepsies.
