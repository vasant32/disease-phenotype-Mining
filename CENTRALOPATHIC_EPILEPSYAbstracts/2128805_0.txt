The spike discharge from 11 children with benign rolandic epilepsy was analyzed using both linear and non-linear regression techniques to estimate the correlation between different scalp regions. To preserve temporal information, short (200 msec.) overlapping windows were used during computation, covering the initial fast and later slow components of the spike. Several unique topographic patterns of electrical interdependence were observed. These changes in association patterns between different scalp regions during the evolution of these spike discharges may shed light on the cortical activation involved.
