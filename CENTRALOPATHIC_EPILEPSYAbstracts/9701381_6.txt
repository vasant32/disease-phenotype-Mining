PURPOSE: We wished to determine incidence, clinical features, and prognosis of benign rolandic seizures (BRS) and benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) in a total population. METHODS: Cases were ascertained through review of all EEG records, and diagnosis was verified by review of medical records. Follow-up information regarding seizures and treatment was obtained from parents and treating physicians. RESULTS: In the Icelandic population aged 3-15 years, the incidence of BRS is 6.2 and BRE 4.7 in 100,000. Five years after onset 95% were seizure-free. At last follow-up, all were seizure free and had not been treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for at least 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that BRS is a common entity in children. The prognosis is excellent and treatment is not necessary in all cases. It is important to identify BRE/BRS correctly and distinguish it from other types of epilepsy.
