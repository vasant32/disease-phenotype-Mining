Typical benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) is a frequent and well-delineated epileptic syndrome in childhood. Mild cognitive and behavioral difficulties are increasingly recognized in the course of BRE and should not be considered as atypical features. Atypical features are recognized on electroclinical grounds. These features, particularly early age at onset and frequent spikes or spike-wave discharges, seem to be risk factors for neuropsychological deficits but also for an atypical evolution of BRE. Atypical evolutions of BRE are defined by the appearance of severe neuropsychological impairments and continuous spike-and-waves during slow sleep (CSWSS). The clinical expressions of these situations correspond to the syndromes known as atypical benign focal epilepsy of childhood (ABFEC), status of BRE, Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), and CSWSS syndrome, which may be part of a continuum related to BRE.
