 INTRODUCTION: Benign epilepsy with central-temporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common epileptic syndrome in childhood. It is an age-dependent, genetically determined and benign condition. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical course and prognosis in 60 patients with BECTS diagnosed in our hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We made a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with BECTS in a University Hospital (1995-2009). They were divided into 2 groups: 1) Patients who met all BECTS classical criteria. 2) Patients who met all the criteria but one (less than 4 years; diurnal seizures; atypical EEG abnormalities). RESULTS: A total of 60 patients, 34 males and 26 females were included, with 31 patients in group 1 and 29 in group 2. The mean age at onset in group 1: 7.45 years, group 2: 6.55 years. Medical treatment was indicated in 32.2% of patients in group 1 and 41.3% in group 2. The outcome was favourable in the majority: 58% in group 1 and 62.1% in group 2 were free of seizures after 1 year. Average age in which it disappeared: 8.54 years in group 1 and 7.84 years in group 2. There were no statistically significant differences in any of these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike that published by some authors, we have not identified any poor outcome factors in patients with BECTS in this study, meaning that an accurate diagnosis correlates with a good prognosis and excellent neurological outcome.
