Waking and sleep EEGs were recorded in 69 siblings of 43 patients with rolandic spikes. 36 suffered from rolandic epilepsy, 7 from other diseases or symptoms (headaches, migraine, learning problems). At least one sibling with epileptic activity was found in 51.16% of the patients. Taking the 69 siblings as a basis, in 26 (37.68%) epileptic activity was recorded. Benign spike foci were recorded in only 4 siblings, generalized spike-wave complexes were seen in 22. Most epileptic activity was recorded in the age group of 5-12 years (54.3%). Nearly one-half (17.4%) was recorded exclusively in sleep, predominantly in sleep stage C (88%). Siblings of patients with (40%) and without seizures (37.5%) showed approximately the same rate, likewise siblings with (40%) and without seizures (34.8%). An autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance is assumed, but a multifactorial mode is also discussed.
