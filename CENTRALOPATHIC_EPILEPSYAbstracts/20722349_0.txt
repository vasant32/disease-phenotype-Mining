Benign focal epilepsy in childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is one of the most common forms of epilepsy. In adults there is a higher percentage of lateralized epileptic discharges in the left cerebral hemisphere; however, in children this pattern does not seem to have the same distribution. The objective of this study was to evaluate the lateralization of interictal spikes in children with BECTS in relation to the sex of the child and the age of onset of epilepsy. We studied the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of 114 children with a clinical diagnosis of BECTS according to ILAE. The results obtained from two EEGs, performed at intervals of 6 and 12 months, were correlated with the age of onset of the epileptic seizures and the sex of the child. There was no association between the onset of epileptic seizures and the age of the child (p=0.461). When we analyzed the relationship between laterality and sex we did not observe any difference in the first EEG (p = 0.767) results; however, in the results of the second EEG there was a difference (p = 0.002). In males, left and bilateral interictal spikes were predominant, and in females the right hemisphere showed predominant spikes and there were continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow sleep (CSWSS). The analysis between laterality and a child's age did not show predominant interictal spikes in the hemispheres, except in males where there were predominant multifocal and generalized spikes, but not lateralization (p=0.011). The conclusion was that in BECTS the lateralization of interictal spikes was not consistent as described in adult patients, but there was a slight left hemispheric predominance in boys and right hemispheric predominance in girls.
