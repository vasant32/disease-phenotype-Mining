Prognosis of 175 psychoneurologically normal children with the onset of epilepsy after 18 months of age were studied. The remission rate of partial epilepsy (81 of 107 cases, 76%) was higher than that of generalized epilepsy (34 of 56 cases, 61%). Prognoses for patients with sleep epilepsy (52 of 62 cases, 84%) were better than those for patients with waking epilepsy (63 of 101 cases, 62%). Most (95%) of the children with sleep epilepsy had partial epilepsy, including benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spike (BECT, 36 cases) and partial epilepsy other than BECT (23 cases). Benign courses were not limited to BECT patients. Generalized waking epilepsy other than absence had the lowest remission rate. Eleven children exhibited mild mental retardation on last examination. Most of them had atypical absence and/or myoclonic seizures with the onset of seizure before 3 years of age. It appeared important to classify the epileptic children with regard to time of seizure occurrence as well as seizure type to determine their prognoses.
