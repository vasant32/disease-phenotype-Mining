Children with benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) experience elevated rates of cognitive, behavioral, and affective problems. Frequent epileptiform spike discharges may impair behavioral functioning. To elucidate this relationship, we evaluated associations between the EEG spike frequency index (SI) and parental ratings of psychosocial adjustment and executive functioning in school-aged children with EEGs typical of BRE. Twenty-one children (6-12 years) participated. Parents completed validated questionnaires at a median of 5 months (range: 1-8) after a routine outpatient EEG. The EEG SI was calculated for wakefulness and sleep. The strength of association between the SI and behavioral variables was evaluated by simple and multivariate correlation. Higher awake and sleep SIs were associated with more symptoms of depression (P<0.001), aggression and conduct problems (P<0.01). Higher sleep SI was associated with executive dysfunction and anxiety (P<0.05). Symptoms of hyperactivity and inattention had no correlation. Increased epileptiform activity in children with BRE may predict higher rates of mood and behavioral problems.
