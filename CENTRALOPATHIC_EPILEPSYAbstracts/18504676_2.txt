 PURPOSE: We have studied the clinical differences between early-onset benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (early-onset BECT) and Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS) to investigate the hypothesis that BECT and PS nosologically constitute age-dependent benign childhood seizure susceptibility syndromes based on a common etiopathogenesis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 24 patients with BECT and 62 patients with PS, who satisfied the following definitions: 1) onset of epilepsy before 5 years of age; 2) the BECT and PS seizures started mainly with orofacial focal motor attacks and emetic symptoms followed by focal seizures, respectively; 3) follow-up examinations for longer than 2 years. We compared the various clinical features between these two groups. RESULTS: In children with early-onset BECT, the seizures at times manifested with hypersalivation, vomiting, and focal motor seizures, but the vomiting that developed in the middle of seizures was different from the initial vomiting observed in patients with PS. Although the seizures recurred more frequently in patients with early-onset BECT, the incidence of status epilepticus as well as prolonged seizures was higher in those with PS. The patients demonstrating below borderline IQ scores and mild developmental behavioral disorders were more frequently seen in early-onset BECT than PS, accounting for 37.5 and 14.6% (P<0.05), and for 8% and 21%, respectively (P<0.05). DISCUSSION: Early-onset BECT and PS have heterogeneous clinical characteristics, except for the same onset age, and appear to be nosologically different epileptic syndromes. The former seems to develop in combination with other acquired disturbances based on a BECT predisposition, while the latter develops based on a PS predisposition and involves a better prognosis.
