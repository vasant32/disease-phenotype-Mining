Epileptic syndromes are more reliable than etiology in determining prognosis and optimal treatment in infants and children. Benign neonatal and infantile convulsions are either idiopathic or dominantly inherited, the latter being genetically nonallelic. Forms of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) include absence epilepsy, benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, and epilepsy with generalized myoclonic atonic seizures. Forms of idiopathic partial epilepsy include benign partial epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECT), benign partial epilepsy with occipital paroxysms, idiopathic partial epilepsy with affective seizures, and benign partial epilepsies with extreme somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPS). These idiopathic epilepsies appear to result from a multifactorial genetic predisposition. The diagnosis is based on strict clinical and EEG criteria. In epileptogenic encephalopathies, cognitive disorders are the main feature and are linked to so-called interictal abnormalities. Some epileptic syndromes, particularly myoclonic epilepsies, remain unclassifiable because of poor understanding of nosology or heterogeneous outcome.
