The reactivity of rolandic spikes (RS) and the occurrence of transitory cognitive impairment (TCI) during RSs were assessed in 33 children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS). The children were assessed simultaneously with EEG and computerized neuropsychological testing in a visual discrimination between words and pseudowords task (DWPT). In 20 (60.6%) children, there were insufficient RS to assess the occurrence of TCI. Of 13 children with RS between stimulus presentation and response, only 2 (15.4%) made a significantly greater proportion of errors during RS than during RS-free periods, characterizing the occurrence of TCI. The RS appear to be easily inhibited by the DWPT. TCI occurred in a limited number of cases and did not impair school performance. There is a need to study other tasks and search for other factors influencing cognitive abilities in children with BECTS.
