This study was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, crossover, placebo-controlled, pilot clinical trial investigating the effect of Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos (K448) on the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) from the EEGs of children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, or "rolandic" epilepsy. The goal was to demonstrate decreased frequency of IEDs with exposure to K448. Four subjects were recruited and 4-hour awake EEG recordings performed. IED frequency per minute was averaged over each of three epochs per hour. Mean IED count per epoch, standard deviations, and variance were calculated. Only complete waking epochs were analyzed. Two subjects demonstrated sufficient waking IEDs for statistical analysis, consisting of three epochs of K448-related effects. Significant decreases in IEDs per minute (33.7, 50.6, and 33.9%) were demonstrated comparing baseline with exposure to K448, but not to control music (Beethoven's FÃ¼r Elise).
