The morphology of the rolandic spike, the trough between the rolandic spike and the following slow wave, and of the slow wave itself was quantitatively studied in 43 children, classified into five clinical groups: (a) functional with epilepsy benign focal epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECT) with oropharyngeal seizures or (b) BECT with unilateral or generalized seizures or (c) functional without epilepsy, and (d) organic with or (e) without epilepsy. The morphologic features of the rolandic spike-and-wave complex were identical in the five clinical categories. Thus, a quantitative description of the rolandic spike-and-wave complex can be given that is valid for the 43 children of the present study, although they represent a heterogeneity of associated clinical syndromes. The rolandic spike appeared to be not a spike but a sharp wave with a mean duration of 88 ms. In contrast to the opinion of several investigators, the morphology of the rolandic spike does not provide a clue to its "epileptogenicity" or to the presence or absence of an organic cerebral lesion in the individual child. In clinical practice, additional information (background activity of the EEG, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain) is needed to determine the significance of rolandic spikes occurring in the EEG of a child with respect to the probability of a cerebral lesion and the prognosis in relation to epileptic seizures.
