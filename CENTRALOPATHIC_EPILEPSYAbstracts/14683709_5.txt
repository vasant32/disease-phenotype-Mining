The purpose of this study was to study the relationship between interictal spike sources and somatosensory cortices in benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood (BREC) using a whole-scalp neuromagnetometer. We recorded spontaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) and EEG signals and cortical somatosensory-evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) to electric stimulation of the median nerve in 9 children with BREC. Interictal rolandic discharges (RDs) and SEFs were analyzed by equivalent current dipole (ECD) modeling. Based on the orientation and locations of corresponding ECDs, we compared generators of RDs with primary (SI) and second somatosensory cortices (SII). Our results showed that RDs and SII responses had similar ECD orientation on the magnetic field maps. The ECDs of RDs were localized 15.3 +/- 1.9 and 12.2 +/- 2.8 mm anterior to SI and SII, respectively. The spatial distance on average from the location of RDs to SII (21.9 +/- 1.6 mm) cortex was significantly shorter than to SI cortex (29.7 +/- 1.7 mm) (P<0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In conclusion, the cortical generators for RDs in patients with BREC are localized in the precentral motor cortex, closer to hand SII than to SI cortex.
