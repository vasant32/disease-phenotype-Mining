The purpose of the study was to evaluate the incidence of a possible combination of rolandic and absence signs in epileptic children, which remains a subject of controversy. The medical files and electroencephalographic (EEG) records of children with rolandic, childhood absence, and juvenile absence epilepsy were retrospectively analyzed. During the antiepilepsy treatment, 6 of 66 patients with rolandic epilepsy, most of them with initial carbamazepine therapy, had absences and generalized spike-wave discharges of a secondarily generalized type. Five cases of 34 children with childhood absence epilepsy and 3 of 11 patients with juvenile absence epilepsy were identified with an EEG focus of the rolandic type. We considered the likely relation of absence features in rolandic epilepsy to the treatment or to an atypical course. The presence of a rolandic focus in absence epilepsies, however, makes the coincidence of these entirely distinct phenomena, even if very rare, not excluded. Further studies are required to elucidate a probable genetic or functional link between partial and primarily generalized EEG discharges in the idiopathic childhood epilepsies.
