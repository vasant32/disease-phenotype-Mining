Epilepsy is a significant health public problem in Senegal with an estimated prevalence of 8 to 14%. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and electroencephalographic features of epilepsy in a cohort of Senegalese infants, search for etiological factors and determine the impact of disease on school life. This retrospective study concerned 459 children who attended the neurological outpatients clinic at the Fann hospital, Dakar, Senegal, between July 2003 and December 2006. All were aged under 19 years. Among the 135 children with idiopathic epilepsy, 23.7% had parental consanguinity and 37.77 % familial epilepsy. Rolandic epilepsy and epilepsy with absences were more frequent but several infants with idiopathic epilepsy were not classified. Non-idiopathic epilepsy was noted in 312 children. In this group, estimates of parental consanguinity and familial epilepsy were of 21.79 and 17.94%, respectively. Etiological factors were predominantly pregnancy and birth abnormalities (28.84%) and central nervous system infection (20.19%). Twelve children had febrile seizures. Of patients with idiopathic epilepsy, 65.18% were attending school versus only 9.29 with non-idiopathic epilepsy.
