In this study, we describe three patients who each had two different forms of idiopathic focal epilepsiy. Two of these patients had electroclinical features compatible with Panayiotopoulos syndrome and benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BCECTS), one of whom developed a particular electroclinical picture of atypical benign focal epilepsy and the other an atypical evolution characterized by verbal auditory agnosia and aphasia. The third patient had clinical and electroencephalographic features of BCECTS and of idiopathic childhood occipital epilepsy (Gastaut type) which evolved into electroclinical features of continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep (CSWS). All three patients presented with two focal idiopathic epilepsies with a particular evolution associated with CSWS, supporting the concept of benign childhood seizure susceptibility syndrome as described by Panayiotopoulos (1993).
