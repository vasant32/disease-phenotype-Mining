We studied 1036 children with epileptic seizures, aged from 1 to 18 years, during 2004-2008. One hundred and six patients were diagnosed with idiopathic focal epilepsy (IFE). The following forms of IFE were singled out: benign seizures of infancy (familial and non-familial) - Watanabe--Vigevano syndrome - 5,7%, occipital epilepsy of childhood with early manifestation (Panayiotopoulos syndrome) -26,4%, occipital epilepsy of childhood with late manifestation (Gastaut syndrome) - 12,3%, benign epilepsy of childhood with central-temporal spikes (rolandic epilepsy) - 51%, benign focal epilepsy with affective symptoms - 4,7%. The efficacy of the first monotherapy was significantly worse in rolandic epilepsy compared to the other IFE forms. Prescription of valproate or the combination of valproate, ethosuximidum and levetiracetam, in case of resistant course, as a starting therapy was found optimal.
