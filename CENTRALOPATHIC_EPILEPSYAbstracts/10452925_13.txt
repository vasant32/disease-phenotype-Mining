Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) is a partial idiopathic epilepsy of childhood presenting with a nocturnal seizure and with a typical EEG showing centrotemporal spike and multifocal or generalized sharp slow waves. Although normal neurological and intellectual development are expected in BRE, it is not infrequent to detect subtle defects in neuropsychological functions and neuromotor development. This study included 20 cases of BRE diagnosed according to the criteria of ILAE. The patients underwent several tests of neuropsychological functions as well as detailed neurological examination and the results were compared statistically to normal controls. In the patient group, a family history of language delay or learning disability (P < 0.005), presence of consanguinity (P < 0. 05), dyspraxia in the lower extremities (to imitation) (P < 0.05), difficulties in go-no-go test (P < 0.001), as well as some problems related to language such as dysprosody (P = 0.05), minor motor deficits in the left (P < 0.05) and right upper extremity (P < 0.05) were significantly more frequent compared to the control group. One should be rather guarded against the prognosis in BRE with respect to the higher cortical functions and neurodevelopmental problems.
