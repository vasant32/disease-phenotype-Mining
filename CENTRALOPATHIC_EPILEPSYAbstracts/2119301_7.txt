Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is characterized by brief stereotypical partial seizures with motor and/or sensory symptoms with frequent secondarily generalized seizures. The interictal EEG shows slow, disphasic, high-voltage spikes in the centrotemporal areas. The few published examples of ictal tracings depict focal rhythmic sharp waves and spikes without significant postictal slowing. We report an ictal event in BECTS that is unusual in the evolution and polarity of the ictal discharges. In this subclinical seizure, ictal multiple spike and wave discharges appear as a dipole: they are electropositive in T3-C3 and negative in F3. These surface positive epileptic discharges are unique and require explanation. We postulate that the seizure discharge arises in the depths of the sylvian fissure involving folded cortical areas. This occurs in such a way that the negative component of the discharges is concealed from the scalp electrodes. Thus, a relative positivity is recorded on the surface. This represents a dipole reversal relative to the interictal discharges (characteristic of BECTS). This geometrical explanation allows us to avoid postulating an unusual mechanism of generation of this seizure.
