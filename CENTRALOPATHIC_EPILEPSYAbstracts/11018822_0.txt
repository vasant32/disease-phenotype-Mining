Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) is known for its dissociation from structural alterations. Nevertheless, the number of cases with reported organic lesions has been increasing. This led to the creation of two subgroups, "benign" and "non benign" BRE, and resulted in the need for additional parameters to define electrographic benignity. We assessed the possible associations between interictal electroencephalographic findings and clinical behavior in 60 BRE cases, testing four parameters of electrographic benignity (paroxysm morphology, horizontal dipole, base rhythms, laterality of rolandic spikes). We also assessed the relationship between neuroimaging findings and electrographic and clinical classifications, and found a statistically significant association (sensitivity=73.5%; specificity=81.8%; positive predictive value=94. 8%; negative predictive value=40.9%). Three of the electrographic parameters proposed were associated with clinical classification: paroxysm morphology, horizontal dipole, and base rhythms. Cases electrographically classified as benign have 21 times more chances to be equally classified as clinically benign according with the tested criteria.
