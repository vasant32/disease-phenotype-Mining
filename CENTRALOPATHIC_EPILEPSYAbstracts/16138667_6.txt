Twenty children (11 females; age range 8y 2mo to 14y 7mo, mean 10y 6mo, SD 1y 8mo) with electroclinically typical rolandic epilepsy (RE), were investigated to demonstrate possible occurrence of abnormal oromotor functions and oral sensibility, linguistic problems, and impaired auditory discrimination. Twelve children were treated with an antiepileptic drug (carbamazepine, valproate, or sulthiame). They were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group of 24 children (14 females; age range 8y 2mo to 14y 5mo, mean 11y, SD 1y 8mo). The test battery included tests for facial expressions, lip and tongue movements, repeated syllables, and articulation using nonsense and tongue-twisting words. Sensibility on tongue and lips was tested with two-point discrimination. As language tests, Rapid Confrontation Naming, orthographic, and phonologic decoding tests were used. A dichotic listening test was performed in 13 children with RE and in 14 controls. Compared to control children, those with RE had significantly greater problems concerning tongue movements (p < 0.05) and articulation (nonsense words and tongue-twisting words; p < 0.01), and worse performance on dichotic listening (p < 0.05). Oro-lingual sensibility and results of language tests did not differ between those with RE and control children. The results indicate that children with RE have distinct but mild problems with oromotor performance and auditory discrimination.
