Characteristics of cognitive deficits in benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) remain unclear. The authors screened 200 BECTS children presenting for a clinical trial, finding relative weaknesses in fine motor control, visual learning, and attention in the presence of overall normal intellect, with simple partial seizures associated with more difficulty. Parental concerns for psychosomatic and learning problems were noted. Monitoring select cognitive and behavioral features in BECTS appears appropriate.
