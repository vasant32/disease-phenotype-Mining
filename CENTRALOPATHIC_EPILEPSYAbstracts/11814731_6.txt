Atypical features of rolandic epilepsy are not uncommon, although the long-term prognosis of this condition is not known. Eighty-five children (50 male and 35 female) attending the Department of Pediatrics of the University of Chieti, the Department of Pediatrics of Brindisi Hospital, and the Department of Neurology of San Valentino Hospital were selected for the study; these patients were subdivided into two groups according to their clinical presentation. Group A consisted of children who suffered from typical rolandic epilepsy and Group B consisted of children with atypical features of rolandic epilepsy. All patients of both groups were re-evaluated after at least 8 years from the first evaluation, and the frequency of seizures and the response to treatment were similar in the two groups of children. In spite of this fact, in patients who suffered from atypical rolandic epilepsy, we found a significantly higher percentage of learning and behavioral disabilities than in children affected by the classical form of rolandic epilepsy (45.5% vs 7.8%; P < 0.0001). In conclusion, atypical rolandic epilepsy seems to be associated with a high percentage of learning and behavioral disorders.
