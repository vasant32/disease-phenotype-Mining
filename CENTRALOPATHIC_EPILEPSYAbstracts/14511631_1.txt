History and present definition of rolandic epilepsy (RE) is briefly presented. In the literature there has often been misconceptions in the description of the syndrome, and the affinity to related conditions and structural abnormalities with rolandic discharges is often unclear. This has resulted in confusion regarding the definition and delineation of RE. A spectrum of RE based on a maturational continuum is possible. Until more is known about the genetic background of RE, a simple classification is proposed: 1) RE "pure" according to the original definition; 2) RE "plus"; 3) RE-related disorders; 4) Structural brain lesions with signs and symptoms as in RE. A summary of results from neuroimaging, neuropsychological and oromotor studies in RE "pure" is presented. Accurate clinical assessment and EEG analysis is essential for a proper classification of RE.
