 AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of learning disorders in children with idiopathic epilepsy. METHODS: The study enrolled 16 children with idiopathic epilepsy, 8 with absence and 8 with rolandic epilepsy. This was a standardized neuropsychological assessment with particular attention to learning performance (reading and writing skills/number processing). RESULTS: Fourteen out of 16 subjects resulted with a specific learning disability, although specific patterns have not been identified. CONCLUSION: The study confirms the higher incidence of learning disorder in children with epilepsy (in front of normal prevalence, 2-10%). The importance of complete neuropsychological evaluation in children with focal or generalized epilepsy was highlighted.
