Rolandic epilepsy belongs to the most frequent forms of epilepsy in children. 43 patients aged 2-14 years were observed. Complex neurologic, genealogic, neurophysiologic and neuroradiologic examinations was performed. There was a microfocal symptomatology in the form of ptosis and syndrome of infantile cerebral paralysis. The changes found at neuroradiologic examination were not related to the location of an epileptic focus and didn't influence the prognosis of the disease. In 10 cases electroencephalographic patterns were observed in clinically healthy relatives. In all the patients a remission of the fits was achieved. Administration of low doses (20 mg/kg daily) of valproic acid (depakin) resulted in a remission of the fits.
