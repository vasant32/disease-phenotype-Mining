We present a retrospective study of 160 children attending our epilepsy out-patient department. Computed tomography (CT) was performed on 123 (77%) patients, namely all children with the exception of those with febrile seizures, typical absence seizures, and benign Rolandic epilepsy. Incidence of CT abnormalities and their correlation with clinical features were evaluated. The CT scan was normal in 84 and abnormal in 39 patients. Although in general, the detection of abnormality on CT will not alter the management of the child, in a small percentage (2%) of our cases a lesion treatable by surgery was discovered. The indications for CT are summarized.
