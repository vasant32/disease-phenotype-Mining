Quantitative EEG aspects are studied in children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotempral spikes (BCET). A total of 27 children, from 7 to 11 years neurologically and intellectually normal was studied and compared to a control group of normal children. They were submitted to anamnesis, neurological examination, Raven test, digital electroencephalogram and quantitative eletroencephalogram analysis. There was a higher delta, theta, alpha and beta absolute power in most of the electrodes and of alpha and beta for some electrodes in the BCET group. Relative theta power was also higher for the BECT group in most of the electrodes. These findings suggest that in BECT there are diffuse differences form age-matched normal children including a difference in relative spectrum of electrical cerebral activity and that this may be related to a functional immaturity.
