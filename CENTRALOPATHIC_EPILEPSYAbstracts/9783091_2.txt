Five children (3 girls and 2 boys) who showed generalized synchronous 3/sec spike and wave complexes as well as centrotemporal spikes in the same EEG or in different EEGs are described. Among these five patients only 1 boy and 1 girl showed clinically both absence seizures and partial motor seizures with or without secondary generalization. One girl and 1 boy have only absences and the other girl only partial motor seizures. A concomitance of generalized synchronous 3/sec spike and wave discharges and centrotemporal spikes in the same patient is rarely found. The clinical manifestation of absences and partial motor seizures in the same patient is extremely rare.
