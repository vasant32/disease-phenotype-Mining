Rolandic epilepsy is frequent in children but seizures are rarely seen by the physician or captured by video-EEG monitoring. In most children the attacks are few and sporadic and generally occur at night. Also, a high percentage of children with benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS) have characteristic centro-temporal spikes based on routine EEG monitoring and therefore do not require further tests such as telemetry or sleep studies. We report a video-EEG recording of a seizure in a patient with rolandic epilepsy which may be useful for educational purposes.
