There are few reports of the ictal pattern of benign partial epilepsy with centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS) in the literature. This paper describes the case of a 7-year-old boy without significant perinatal history or psychomotor development delay. There was positive family history of seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the head was normal. The patient had a nocturnal isolated seizure, followed by a postictal motor deficit at the left arm. The EEG two days after the seizure showed a normal background activity with spikes in the centrotemporal bilateral area, and two subclinicals rhythmic discharges of spike and wave, with a duration of more than 50 seconds in the right centrotemporal area. This pattern of rhythmic discharge wasn not described in BECTS before.
