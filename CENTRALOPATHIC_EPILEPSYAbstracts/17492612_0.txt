INTRODUCTION: Benign focal epilepsy in infancy with centro-temporal paroxysms is a frequent form of epilepsy within this group of epilepsies. Despite its relative benignity, however, it may be accompanied by neuropsychological deficits and therefore constitutes a suitable in vivo model for studying how the brain functions when processing information. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 7-year-old child who began with this type of epilepsy by manifesting focal seizures during the early stages of sleep and who, with the absence of any continuous spike-wave activity in non-REM sleep, presented transient unilateral neglect syndrome on the right-hand side related with electroencephalographic intercritical activity. CONCLUSIONS: The neuropsychological manifestations in this type of epilepsy can be due to intercritical paroxysmal activity. The clinical features depend on where the paroxysms are located and in which direction they spread. A dysfunction of the physiological neuronal synchrony among the neuronal networks that are necessary for thinking processes could be the cause of this disorder.
