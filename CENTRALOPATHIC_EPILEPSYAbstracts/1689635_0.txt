We studied the relationships between clinical variables and those related to the states of vigilance in 18 cases of benign partial epilepsy with centro-temporal spike-waves, 22 cases of definite symptomatic partial epilepsy, and 16 cases of undetermined partial epilepsy. The time of day during which the seizures appeared and the paroxysmal activity densities during non-REM and REM sleep are not distributed differently among the 3 electro-clinical types. However, the benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes group had more patients with sleep-sensitive paroxysmal activities. Patients who mainly had nocturnal seizures were found to have more frequent generalized seizures and a greater sleep-sensitive paroxysmal activity. Three cases demonstrated continuous spike-waves during sleep. The patients who had little or no paroxysmal activity during sleep were the youngest. This study illustrates that sleep-sensitive seizures and paroxysmal activities are not specific to benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes, and that seizures and paroxysmal activities are two manifestations associated with epilepsy, affected in different ways by states of vigilance.
