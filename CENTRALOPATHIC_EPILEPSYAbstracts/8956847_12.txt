PURPOSE: We studied the functional organization of the interictal epileptic spike complex in patients with benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood (BREC). METHODS: We recorded interictal epileptiform spikes and somatosensory evoked potentials after median nerve stimulation, providing a biologic marker for the location of the central sulcus in 12 patients with BREC. We used multiple dipole modeling to assess the number, the three-dimensional intracerebral location, and the time activity of the underlying neuronal sources. RESULTS: Although the interictal spike complex could be modeled by a single tangential dipolar source in seven patients (group 1), in the remaining five patients, two sources-a radial and a tangential dipole-were necessary adequately to explain the interictal spikes (group 2). The tangential source was located deeper than the radial source and was characterized by a frontal positivity and a centroparietal negativity with a phase reversal across the central sulcus, suggesting that the interictal spikes originated in the anterior wall of the central sulcus. The radial source showed a single electronegativity over the ipsilateral central region, which would be compatible with involvement of the top of either the pre- or postcentral gyrus. Both sources showed biphasic time patterns with an average latency difference of 30 ms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that in some patients with typical BREC, the interictal epileptiform spike complex is generated by multiple, simultaneously active neuronal populations within the central region and that epileptiform activity is propagated between these two adjacent cortical areas.
