We report on an otherwise healthy infant who presented with clusters of alternating central facial nerve paresis. At 11 months of age, the patient showed intermittent facial asymmetry compatible with right-sided upper motor neuron facial paresis and accompanying incomplete upper motor neuron hypoglossal paresis. Laboratory work-up and imaging studies did not reveal signs of infection, infarction or structural lesions, and after one week, symptoms spontaneously resolved. Similar episodes affecting alternate sides were noted at ages of 17, 27 and 49 months lasting for 4-14 days. At 49 months, EEG showed right temporo-occipital benign sharp waves with activation during drowsiness and sleep. A diagnosis of benign focal epilepsy with negative motor phenomena was made. She is now 60 months old and no further episodes have occurred without antiepileptic treatment. Ictal orofacial phenomena are the clinical hallmark of benign focal epilepsy with centro-temporal sharp waves (BECTS). As in our patient, negative epileptic motor phenomena frequently lead to a broad diagnostic work-up. In infants presenting with episodic central facial nerve paresis, the possibility of negative epileptic motor phenomena should be considered.
