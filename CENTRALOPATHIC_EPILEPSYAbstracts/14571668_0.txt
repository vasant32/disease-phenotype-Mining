The article summarized the results of long-term studies of the author with using experimental methods--creation of penicillin and aluminium epileptogenic foci, orbito-frontal cortex stimulation and elimination, and clinical investigation of epileptic status, prefrontal epilepsy, absence EEG activity, symptomatic rolandic epilepsy, childhood epilepsy. Based on the results obtained, the author formulates the conceptions on (1) the key role of prefrontal cortex in the antiepileptic defense system and motor activity control, (2) the role of slow activity in antiepileptogenesis, (3) the age-dependent rhythmic possibilities of children's brain, which determined age-dependent epilepsy types, (4) the complexity of between-hemispheric interactions in this disease.
