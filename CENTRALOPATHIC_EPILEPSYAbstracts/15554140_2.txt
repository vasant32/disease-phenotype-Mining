Thirty-three patients, aged 3-29 years, with the following epileptic types: symptomatic forehead (15), symptomatic temporal (6), symptomatic occipital (2), juvenile myoclonic, in combination with eyelid myoclonus syndrome with absences, (5), epilepsy with isolated generalized seizures (3) and rolandic epilepsy (2), were treated with topamax. A medication dose was 50-200 mg per day in children younger 12 years and 100-550 mg per day in those older 12 years and in adults. The results obtained suggest the high efficacy and well tolerability of topamax in monotherapy of epilepsy. Therapeutic effect was achieved in 28 out of 33 patients (84.8%), i.e. seizures stopping--in 18 patients (54.5%). Monotherapy was mostly effective in symptomatic forehead epilepsy: seizures stopped in 53.3% patients and a frequency of seizures reduced in 33.3%. Side-effects were detected only in 18% cases, they were mostly transient and resulted in treatment withdrawal in 6% patients only.
