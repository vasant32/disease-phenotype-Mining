Benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECT) was studied in Malaysian children, and was observed in Chinese, Malay and Indian children in the ratio 10:6:5. There were 12 boys and 9 girls. Fit frequency varied from almost daily to a single fit. The age of onset ranged from 2-13 years and BECT was not noted in any child over 13 years old. There was a strong circadian rhythm and fits occurred mainly in sleep. Generalised seizures were more common than partial seizures. During the 3-year study from April 1989 to April 1992, 21 children with BECT were identified from the EEG records done at the University Hospital and it was found that this genetic epilepsy which is autosomal dominant with age dependent penetrance occurs in approximately 4.8% of our epileptic children. In addition there were 3 children in whom petit mal co-existed with a BECT EEG trait.
