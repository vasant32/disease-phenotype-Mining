Corticosteroids are often considered as the first therapeutic choice in children with continuous spike and wave in slow-wave sleep on electroencephalogram; however, they are associated with significant adverse effects. "Idiopathic" forms of continuous spike and wave in slow-wave sleep may represent the severe end of the spectrum of benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood. This report describes a 5-year-old male with language delay who presented with a single focal-onset, nocturnal seizure and had continuous spike and wave in slow-wave sleep on electroencephalography. After 1 month of sulthiame therapy, his electroencephalographic abnormality had resolved, and his language development improved.
