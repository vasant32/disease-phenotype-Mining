The purpose of this paper is to compare the morphological features of interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) in patients with benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes to IED of those with symptomatic localization related epilepsies using information theory. Three patients from each clinical group were selected. Two-second epochs centered at the peak negativity of the sharp waves were analyzed from a referential montage during stage I sleep. The epochs from the two groups were compared using parametric and information theory analysis. Information analysis determined the likelihood of correctly identifying the clinical group based on the IED. Standard parametric, morphological and spectral analyses were also performed. We found no significant difference in the morphology of the sharp wave between the two groups. The after-going slow wave contained the greatest information that separated the two groups. This result was supported by morphological and spectral differences in the after-going slow wave. Greater distinguishing information is held in the after-going slow wave than the sharp wave for the identification of clinical groups. Information analysis may assist in differentiating clinical syndromes from EEG signals.
