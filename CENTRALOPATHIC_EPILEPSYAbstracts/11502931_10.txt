Forty-three of 79 children (54%) with benign rolandic epilepsy from a regional population were treated with antiepileptic drugs (AED); 36 (46%) were not. Physician advice was a major determinant of treatment choice. AED significantly reduced generalized seizures (p = 0.001) but did not reduce partial seizures. After 4 to 14 years and >900 seizures, all patients were in remission without medication or injury. Physicians may confidently offer a no-AED treatment strategy.
