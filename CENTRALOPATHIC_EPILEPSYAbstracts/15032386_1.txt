A 5-year-old boy presented with typical clinical and electrophysiologic features of benign rolandic epilepsy. His neurodevelopment, language, and behavior prior to the onset of epilepsy were appropriately normal. He demonstrated marked deterioration of language and cognitive function during the course to a mild and then a moderate disability range. Serial sleep electroencephalographic recordings initially showed continuous and bilateral rolandic discharges with evolution to localized left rolandic spikes. Language and cognitive improvements were subsequently seen. Educational support and evolution of the electroencephalogram to a localized focus could have been contributory. It is anticipated, however, that he will have significant long-term problems in complex language.
