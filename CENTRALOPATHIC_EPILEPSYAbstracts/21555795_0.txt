Benign partial seizures of adolescence (BPSA) presents as partial seizures with or without secondary generalization occurring isolated or in a cluster in the first 24 to 48 hours after onset in adolescents. Correct recognition of this entity can avoid use of antiepileptic drugs and associated risks. We conducted retrospective review of charts to identify seven cases of BPSA between 11-15 years at presentation who did not have generalized epilepsy, benign rolandic epilepsy, benign occipital epilepsy, an epileptogenic lesion on neuroimaging, or unprovoked recurrent tonic-clonic seizures. All of them had partial seizures, normal neuroimaging and electroencephalogram with no recurrence of seizures despite no treatment.
