Aware of parental reports of academic variability, we investigated month-to-month fluctuations in cognitive abilities and EEG status by repeated measures testing in six children with benign epilepsy with central-temporal spikes (BECTS). All showed greater than normal test-retest variability. Daytime EEG abnormalities were also variable. Short-term fluctuations in cognitive function appear common in children with BECTS, potentially impacting academic performance.
