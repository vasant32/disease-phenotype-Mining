Serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies (A AchR Ab) and anti-synaptic premembrane antibodies (A PrM Ab) were measured in 21 patients with absence epilepsy, 21 cases with benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BCECTs) and 13 cases with atypical epilepsy. Respectively, in five (23.8%), eleven (51.2%) and eight (66.7%) of the above mentioned groups of patients both A AchR Ab and A PrM Ab were found.
