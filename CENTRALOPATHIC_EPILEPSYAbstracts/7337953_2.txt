Abnormal arousal responses paired with paroxysmal discharges and photosensitivity are the principal mechanisms in the precipitation of seizures in primary generalized epilepsy. The abnormal arousal responses show a consistent maximum over the frontal midline region. An exception from this rule was found in two children with primary generalized epilepsy (petit mal absences, one also with grand mal) with a strongly positive family history. In these patients, the generalized-synchronous bursts showed a maximum over the vertex (Cz electrode). Both of these children also had single spikes over the Rolandic region. A relationship between primary generalized and benign Rolandic epilepsy is demonstrated. Both forms of seizure disorder are based on dysfunction (hyperexcitability) rather than on a structural epileptogenic lesion. A dichotomy of dysfunctional and structural epilepsies is presented but gray zones of overlap indubitably exist. The limitations of the dichotomy concept are pointed out.
