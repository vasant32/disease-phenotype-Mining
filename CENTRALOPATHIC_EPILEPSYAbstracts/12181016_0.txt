 PURPOSE: To describe an association between continuous simple partial seizures and independent right and left partial seizures in children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS). METHODS: Three children with BCECTS and episodes of continuous simple partial seizures are described. RESULTS: All three children had a history of typical rolandic seizures occurring on the right and left sides of the body on different occasions. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of independent right and left rolandic seizures in children with BCECTS may be a predisposing factor for the development of partial status epilepticus.
