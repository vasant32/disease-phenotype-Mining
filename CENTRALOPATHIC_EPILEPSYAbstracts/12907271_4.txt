In order to collect local data for children with Benign Childhood Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS), we conducted a retrospective study of 50 Chinese children (32 males and 18 females) with BECTS diagnosed in two regional hospitals in Hong Kong from 1995 to 1998. Their peak age of onset was 7 years (range 3-13 years) and a male predominance was observed. Seven patients (14%) had a past history of febrile convulsions and five cases (10%) had a family history of epilepsy. The presentation was protean, but most of them had infrequent, short, nocturnal generalised seizures. The EEG spike foci were most frequently found in mid-temporal regions, followed by centrotemporal regions. Fourteen percent of children did not require anti-epileptic drug treatment. For those who were treated, they were easily controlled on a low dose of carbamazepine (median dosage of 12.75 mg/kg per day) or sodium valproate (median dosage of 20 mg/kg per day). Our study suggested a generally good prognosis for BECTS. No risk factors of frequent seizure recurrence could be identified.
