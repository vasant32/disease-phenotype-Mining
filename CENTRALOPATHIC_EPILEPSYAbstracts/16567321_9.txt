Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is regarded as a benign form of epilepsy because of its usually favorable outcome, in terms of seizures. Eighteen children with BECTS were studied in terms of neuropsychological and learning abilities: intellectual quotient, oral language (phonological production, naming skills, verbal fluency and syntactic comprehension), drawing and visuo-spatial skills, visual and selective attention, verbal and visuo-spatial memory, reading, numeracy and spelling. The mean IQ of the population was within the normal range, but individual results were heterogeneous. Verbal functions and memory were normal. In contrast, drawing and visuo-spatial skills, attention and visuo-spatial memory were significantly weak compared to the normal range for age. Reading, numeracy and/or spelling ability were significantly delayed by one academic year or more in ten of the children. In conclusion, despite its benign outcome in terms of epilepsy, BECTS can be accompanied by specific cognitive disorders and low academic achievement.
