 OBJECTIVE: An association between impaired school performance and rolandic epilepsy is frequently reported. Language outcome, in particular, seems to be affected, although rolandic epilepsy originates from the motor-sensory cortex. In this study we tried to find a correlation between locomotion problems and language impairment. METHODS: In this noncontrolled, open, clinical cohort study of 48 children with rolandic epilepsy, a 24-hour EEG and a neuropsychological assessment were obtained for all children. RESULTS: Children with rolandic epilepsy had a significant delay in reading skills (reading words: mean=6 months, SD=11.9, P<0.002; reading sentences: mean=8.6 months, SD=12.7, P<0.001), compared with the healthy population. There was a significant correlation between problems in motor development and delays in reading skills (reading words: r=-0.426, P=0.006; reading sentences: r=-0.343, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Reading performance is impaired in children with rolandic epilepsy. Reading of sentences is more impaired than reading of words. There is a significant correlation between problems in motor development and language, suggesting their interaction at the level of the cortex.
