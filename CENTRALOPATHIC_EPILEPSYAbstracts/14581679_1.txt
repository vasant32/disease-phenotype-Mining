Reported is an association of atypical benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) and homocystinuria in three apparently healthy children with borderline intelligence, two of whom had difficult-to-control seizures. In all three, EEG were suggestive of BECTS, although the clinical features were not. Homocystinuria could not be diagnosed for several years, pending metabolic evaluation.
