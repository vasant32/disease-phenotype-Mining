 PURPOSES: To elucidate the oscillatory dynamics with respect to interictal spike occurrence in benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE). METHODS: Using a whole-scalp magnetoencephalography (MEG), we recorded scalp EEG and MEG signals in 10 BRE patients (age 8-12 years) and visually identified unilateral interictal spikes that were simultaneously present on both EEG and MEG channels. We obtained the peak timing of individual spike complex based on MEG single-dipole modeling, and then applied wavelet transform to analyze the time-frequency components of corresponding MEG signals with respect to spike occurrence. RESULTS: In the hemisphere with time-domain spike waveforms, we identified a clear increase of 0.5-40 Hz activity around the spike peak, most prominent at alpha band (8-13 Hz). Notably, at the approximate timing we also observed an increase in 0.5-25 Hz oscillations over the homotopic area in the other hemisphere where no spike signals were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate bilateral increases in 0.5-25 Hz oscillations during unilateral spike formation in BRE patients. By using wavelet transform analysis, one could be able to detect some irritative feature that would in visual analysis remain undetected.
