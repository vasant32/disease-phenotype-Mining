Neuropsychological implications of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes-rolandic spikes (BECTS) have not been adequately investigated. The aim of this study was to compare the results in a school performance test of patients with BECTS and normal age-matched controls. A total of 20 children with BECTS and 20 normal controls were submitted to anamnesis, clinical evaluation, Raven test, school performance test (SPT), digital electroencephalogram and quantitative electroencephalogram analysis. Comparing with normal controls, children with BECTS showed significantly lower SPT results, especially in reading test. There was an association between the higher number of rolandic spikes and inferior performance in SPT reading test. These findings suggest that discharges may be a factor in the genesis of lower performance in reading test in children with BECTS.
