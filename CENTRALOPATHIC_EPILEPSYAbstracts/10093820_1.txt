The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term evolution of headache associated with rolandic centrotemporal spikes (CTS). The patient group consisted of a group of 32 children who suffered from headache and presented CTS at electroencephalogram (EEG). As the control group, we selected 52 sex- and age-matched children with headache without any EEG abnormalities. During a follow-up of 5 years none of them showed epileptic seizures. The number of headache attacks decreased in the majority of patients, as in the controls. A good correlation could be identified between CTS and the number of headaches attacks both at baseline (r = 0.58, P < 0.001) and at follow-up (r = 0.64, P < 0.001). In four children (12.5%), the frequency of headache attacks increased and this increase was associated with a higher frequency of CTS. In two patients, a change in the EEG pattern was observed during follow-up, with a 'migration' of the epileptiform complex from central to parietooccipital leads. In conclusion, these findings confirm that CTS are not pathognomonic of centrotemporal epilepsy and that evolution of CTS and headache in children are statistically related.
