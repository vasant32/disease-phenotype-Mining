 BACKGROUND: Up till now there have been many discussions in the epileptological literature concerning the occurrence of cognitive deficits in children with rolandic epilepsy (RE). The aim of study: The aim of this study is to establish whether there exist any differences in general intelligence quotient or in particular cognitive functions in children with RE as compared to healthy children in the same age and if a correlation can be found between EEG and cognitive function in RE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The material comprised two groups: 38 children with RE (1-2 years after diagnosis establishing) and 15 children of the same age and sex - the control group. The study group was then subdivided into: 26 children with typical EEG patterns and 12 with atypical EEG acc. to Dalla Bernardina. The results of WICS, Benton, Raven's test, Bender-Koppitz and Bender-Gestalt test and 16-canal standard wake and sleep EEG were taken into account. Statistical analysis included: Student-test and Fisher exact test. RESULTS: IQ of children with RE in all types of scores (full, verbal or non-verbal) did not differ from the control group. Some differences in particular cognitive functions were found: auditory memory (p<0.01), logical thinking (p<0.05). In the group of children with RE and atypical EEG pattern the full and non-verbal score was lower (p< 0.05) and we found in these children statistically significant deficit in analytic-synthetic thinking based on concrete material and hyperactivity (p< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In spite of no difference in general IQ among children with RE and the control group, there are some cognitive deficits in this epilepsy particularly concerning auditory memory and logical thinking. The children with atypical changes in EEG are the risk group of lower full and nonverbal score analytic-synthetic thinking based on concrete material and hyperactivity.
