Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) and childhood epilepsy with occipital paroxysms (CEOP) are overlapping in age range of presentation. Some children have been reported to manifest occipital and rolandic seizures, as distinct events. However, the presence during the same seizure of rolandic and occipital symptoms is exceptional. We present a 7-year-old boy with BRE in whom we video-EEG recorded two seizures at 4 years of age. The first episode was a classic rolandic seizure during sleep, while the second was prolonged with initial rolandic and late occipital involvement. It is possible that a rolandic seizure, in a child within the age range of both BRE and early onset CEOP, could spread to selectively involve the occipital lobe, because there is susceptibility of cortical neurons of both areas to develop seizures at this age in idiopathic partial epilepsies.
