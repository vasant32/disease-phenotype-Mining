An initial investigation of cognitive functions in 32 children, aged 7 to 15 years, with rolandic epilepsy (RE), using an extensive test battery, was followed 2.5 to 3 years later by a second assessment of 26 of these children, using the same technique. The initial investigation reported cognitive deficits in memory and learning of auditory-verbal material together with executive functions compared with controls. At the second assessment, the ability for immediate memory, memory and learning of visuospatial as well as auditory-verbal material and delayed recall was the same in the RE group as in the control group. On one of the tests measuring executive functions, Verbal Fluency, the RE group scored significantly lower than controls. With respect to reading and writing ability, the children with RE had some difficulty with word comprehension. Nonverbal reasoning was the same in the two groups, as was general IQ. In conclusion, the children with RE did not present any major cognitive difficulties when a mean of approximately 5 years had passed since onset of the typical syndrome, and at a time when most of them were seizure-free. Maturational factors apparently are of importance to the course of RE.
