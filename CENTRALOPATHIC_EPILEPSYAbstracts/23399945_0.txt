By means of a longitudinal case study, we demonstrated the course of cerebral reorganization of language representation due to epilepsy in a child with benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS) evolving to Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS) and returning to BECTS. The child underwent the following procedures at the ages of 8.2, 8.6, and 9.3years: 3D source EEG imaging, language fMRI (sentence generation and reading), and neuropsychological testing. He had a follow-up testing at the age of 10.8years. Further, 24-h EEGs were regularly performed. At the age of around 8years, the child was diagnosed initially with left-hemispheric BECTS, which evolved to LKS with continuous bilateral discharges. In addition, 3D source imaging data revealed a left anterior temporal focus with a spreading to the right parietal and left centro-parietal areas. The patient had verbal agnosia with poor verbal yet good performance indices. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed a left-hemispheric reading network but sentence generation was impossible to perform. After initiation of adequate treatment, continuous discharges disappeared, and only very rare left-hemispheric centro-temporal spikes remained. Verbal IQ and performance IQ increased at the age of 8.6years. Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed, at this time, a right-hemispheric language activation pattern for sentence generation and reading. At the ages of 9.3 and 10.8years, language tasks remained right-hemispheric and verbal IQ remained stable, but right-hemispheric non-verbal functions decreased due to possible crowding-out mechanisms.
