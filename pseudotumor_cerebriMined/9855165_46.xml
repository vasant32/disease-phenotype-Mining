<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> associated with resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> from idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen consecutive female patients with IIH associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Patients underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> during a 24-week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> was graded: absent (grade 0), mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), and marked (grade 3), based on a predetermined grading system ("gold standard") using stereoscopic photographs and the Fris√©n classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 15 patients, with mean age of 31.3+/-8.8 years, had a mean weight of 110.5+/-28.7 kg and mean body mass index of 40.7+/-13.0 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven (73.3%) patients had improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> during the 24-week study period, of which 10 (66.7%) had complete resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> within a median time of 8.5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An average of 3.3% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (+/-0.5% standard error of the mean) was observed among patients having a one-grade change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> of 6.2%+/-0.6% standard error of the mean was associated with a three-grade change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (i.e., complete resolution of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine of the ten patients with complete resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> also took <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, none (26.7%) of the four patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> had improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> despite similar treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 6% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was associated with resolution of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in these authors' patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> in IIH is questioned since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, rather than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, appeared to have been the catalyst for reducing the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
