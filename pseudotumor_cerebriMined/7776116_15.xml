<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report 13 cases of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IH) in children with growth hormone (GH) deficiency treated with GH in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The group consisted of eight boys and five girls, 3 to 16 years of age (median, 9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interval from starting GH therapy to diagnosis of IH was 2 weeks or less in six patients, between 2 and 12 weeks in four, 8 months in one, 5 years in one, and unknown in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were not known to have previously described IH risk factors; the other six had at least one factor each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients but one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and visual changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, and cerebrospinal fluid pressures were elevated (&gt; 250 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GH dosage range was 0.17 to 0.35 mg per kilogram body weight per week (median, 0.30 mg/kg per week) for the 11 patients with dosage data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After discontinuation of GH and treatment with lumbar punctures and/or medications, signs and symptoms resolved in eight children; in two of these children signs and symptoms reappeared when GH therapy was restarted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four patients signs and symptoms resolved while GH therapy was continued; one child was treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt because of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cyst</z:hpo>, after which GH was restarted without subsequent IH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 12 patients with idiopathic GH deficiency the course of IH was benign, with complete resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because doses and scheduling of GH administration have changed since the introduction of recombinant GH, higher doses and increased frequency of administration may be contributing to the development of IH in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest beginning therapy at the lowest recommended dose, with gradual titration to higher doses, and the performance of routine funduscopic examinations during initiation of GH therapy and whenever signs or symptoms of IH develop </plain></SENT>
