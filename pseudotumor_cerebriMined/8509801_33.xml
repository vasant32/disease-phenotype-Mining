<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The group was comprised of 76 females and 5 males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ages ranged from 8 to 55 years; the mean +/- S.D. was 28.6 +/- 7.9 for women and 21.0 +/- 14.5 for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average crude annual incidence rates for IIH per 100,000 persons were 2.2 for the total and 4.3 for females for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages (3.2 for the total and 5.9 for the females when adjusted to the 1980 United States population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In females aged 15-44 years, IIH occurred at a rate of 12.0 per 100,000 per year; for those defined as <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, the rate rose to 21.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> occurred as a sequelae in 20% of our patients </plain></SENT>
