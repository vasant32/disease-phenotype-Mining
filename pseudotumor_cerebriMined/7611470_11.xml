<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether red cell flow velocity in individual capillaries of the cerebral cortex is maintained during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> decreases in CPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microcirculation of the superficial parietal cerebral cortex of adult <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi>-anesthetized artificially ventilated rats was visualized using a new design of closed-perfused cranial window and epifluorescent-intensified video microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">Fluorescein-isothiocyanate</z:chebi>-labeled red blood cells (FRBC) injected intravenously were used as markers of capillary flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CPP, defined as mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure, was reduced by controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or by stepwise elevation of local intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The movement of FRBC in the parenchymal capillary network was video recorded at each pressure level, and FRBC velocity in each capillary was measured off-line with use of the dual-window digital cross-correlation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FRBC flux in the capillaries was measured by automated cell counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FRBC velocity at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perfusion pressure was 1.47 +/- 0.58 (SD) mm/s and changed little in the perfusion pressure range of 70-120 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The autoregulatory index in this pressure range was 0.0049 mm.s-1.mmHg-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Opening of previously unperfused capillaries was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FRBC flux correlated with FRBC velocity, but the latter was maintained in a narrower range than FRBC flux, suggesting a decrease in capillary diameter or hematocrit with decreasing perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that flow autoregulation is associated with the maintenance of capillary flow velocity and that capillary recruitment does not contribute to flow autoregulation in the rat cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
