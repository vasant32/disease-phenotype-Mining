<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain-tumor</z:mp> patients and two benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intracranial pressure was recorded through an indwelling ventricular catheter attached to a pressure transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The systemic blood pressure was recorded through an intraarterial catheter placed in the femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recordings were made from 18 to 40 hours and a total of 770 plateau waves were examined in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The systemic blood pressure showed little or no change in spite of a marked rise in intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The respiratory alterations were always noted during the plateau waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This respiratory changes during the plateau waves were assigned into three patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The first was the suppressed respiratory pattern during the entire course of the plateau waves (Type I): the second was the pattern characterized by the initial suppression followed by the late <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> (Type II); and the third was the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> pattern during the entire course of the plateau waves (Type III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pattern of Type I was noticed in 65% of the observed plateau waves, the pattern of Type II in 23%, and the pattern of Type III in 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The heart rate decreased in most plateau waves, but there was little change in the heart rate in some plateau waves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
