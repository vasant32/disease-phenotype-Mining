<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Traditionally, idiopathic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks have been associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial pressure (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We speculate that at least one subset of these leaks may be associated with elevated ICP, more specifically, idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify radiographic manifestations suggestive of elevated ICP in 14 patients with idiopathic CSF leaks who clinically and epidemiologically resembled patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed high-resolution CT, MRI, and/or CT cisternography in 14 patients with elevated ICP and idiopathic CSF leaks for radiographic manifestations suggesting increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arachnoid pits were seen in 79% of patients, empty sella was seen in 50% of patients, meningo(encephalo)celes were seen in 50% of patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> was seen in 35% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Optic nerve findings were not shown as commonly seen as described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We show a subset of patients with idiopathic CSF leaks who display radiographic signs consistent with increased ICP who may represent an alternative presentation of IIH </plain></SENT>
