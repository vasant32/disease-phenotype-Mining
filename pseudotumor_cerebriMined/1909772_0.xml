<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>10%, 20% and 30% of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> were made and intravenously administrated with the same volume and speed (0.667 ml/kg/min) for 15 minutes to each <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> concentration group of cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequential changes of ICP were monitored and serial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> concentration, serum osmolality and electrolytes were then performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> concentration showed a biexponential curve and best fitted to the two-compartment model analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.9286) between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> concentration and extrinsic serum osmolality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disposition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> in cats was similar to that which had been reported in dogs and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution half-time was faster in 30% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, but the elimination half-time was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The integrated values of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> concentration difference between the central (Cc) and the peripheral compartment (Pc) were greatly correlated with the changes of ICP reduction during <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> administration (for 15min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time to vanish the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> concentration difference between Cc and Pc showed strong reverse correlation with the time to reach the lowest ICP level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The result indicates that the more rapidly <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> was administrated, the more rapidly the concentration difference between the two compartments was created, and, the higher the effective osmolality was developed, then, the more profound and prolonged ICP reduction can be obtained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
