<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data from the Kabi (Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn) international growth database (KIGS) for 82 children with Langerhan's cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> treated with recombinant growth hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the start of treatment the median (10-90th centile) age was 9.0 (5.2 to 14.7) years, with a median height standard deviation score (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) of -2.0 (-3.5 to -0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median pretreatment height velocity (measured in cm/year) was 3.6 (0.9 to 6.4); this increased to 8.8 (3.8 to 12.0) in the first year of treatment with growth hormone, and then remained significantly greater than the pretreatment height velocity at 7.3 (4.4 to 9.7) and 7.1 (4.1 to 9.3) cm/year in the second and third years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> increased from -2.0 to -0.8 (-2.3 to 0.6) by the end of three years of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no increase in the recurrence rate of the underlying disease and no adverse event could be directly attributed to growth hormone treatment, apart from one case of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> that resolved on stopping treatment with growth hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Growth hormone replacement treatment for patients with Langerhan's cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000824'>growth hormone deficiency</z:hpo> is beneficial and safe </plain></SENT>
