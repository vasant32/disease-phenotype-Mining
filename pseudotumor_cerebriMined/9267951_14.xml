<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A hepatologic intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Seventy-nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002480'>hepatic encephalopathy</z:hpo> grade 3 or 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: None </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum admission concentrations of both total and nonactin-complexed (free) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Gc</z:e>-globulin were determined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both total and free <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Gc</z:e>-globulin values were significantly lower in the patients, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Gc</z:e>-globulin values were significantly reduced in patients who subsequently developed cardiovascular failure (p &lt; .01), intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p &lt; .001), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (p &lt; .001), compared with those patients who did not </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with total <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Gc</z:e>-globulin values in the lowest quintile had on average 2.6 organ failures, whereas patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Gc</z:e>-globulin concentrations in the highest quintile had 0.9 organ failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures for the lowest and highest quintiles of free <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Gc</z:e>-globulin were 3.0 and 1.1 organ failures, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both total and free <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Gc</z:e>-globulin were inversely correlated to the number of organ failures (p &lt; .005 in both cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with multiple organ failure (&gt; or = 2 organ failures) had significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Gc</z:e>-globulin values compared with patients without multiple organ failure (p &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
