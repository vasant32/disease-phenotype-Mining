<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the sensitivity of confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) in detecting clinically significant changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> secondary to idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) and the correlation with visual field loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients--three new, two recurrent, and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cases of IIH--were examined over a 9 month period with SLO (Heidelberg retina tomograph) of optic nerve head and 30-2 Humphrey visual fields (six cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Optic disc swelling (volume) was assessed in each eye using a circular contour line placed around the swollen optic nerve head on the mean image of three topographic images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine volume measurements from single images in each eye of every patient were performed on one occasion to assess repeatability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cases optic disc volumes (range 1-16 mm3) decreased with treatment to stable, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of these had mild, reproducible, field defects which resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cases had stable or fluctuating disc volume with no detectable change in grade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> and mild field loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one case which underwent theco-peritoneal shunting both disc volume and field worsened, indicating therapeutic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both improved postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SLO has a high sensitivity for detecting small changes in disc volumes and correlates closely with visual field change in the short term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It can confirm therapeutic failure by detecting stable or increasing disc volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decreasing volume may indicate resolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo>, so accompanying funduscopy and visual fields remain essential </plain></SENT>
