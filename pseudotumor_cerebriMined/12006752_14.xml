<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Slit ventricle syndrome (SVS) has been described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> patients who continue to have shunt malfunction-like symptoms in the presence of a functioning shunt system and small ventricles on imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These symptoms usually present years after shunt placement or revision and can consist of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo> and decreased cognitive skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatments offered range from observation, medical therapy (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> treatment) and shunt revision to subtemporal decompression or cranial vault expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a subset of patients with SVS who were symptomatic with high intracranial pressure (ICP) as measured by sedated lumbar puncture and whose symptoms completely resolved after lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS) placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with a diagnosis of SVS underwent lumboperitoneal shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age at shunting ranged from 3 to 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most had undergone recent ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) revisions for presentation of shunt malfunction-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite this, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> remained symptomatic and underwent a sedated lumbar puncture to measure opening pressure (OP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had high OP in spite of a functional VPS and underwent LPS placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 7 patients had a prolonged period of overdrainage symptoms after lumboperitoneal shunting that resolved completely over several weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The initial etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was reported to include trauma, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002410'>aqueductal stenosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients required revision of their LPS, after which their symptoms again resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a certain subset of patients with SVS who are symptomatic from increased ICP, placement of an LPS is an effective treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It appears that this subgroup of patients previously treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting behave in a fashion similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> patients and respond well to lumboperitoneal shunting </plain></SENT>
