<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The character of the pressure curves is thought to result from interaction between the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> effect and the observed system's shifting equilibrium position, which is caused by other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The character of the pressure curves prior to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> infusion must be taken into consideration in estimating the actual effect of the drug; the authors suggest that in certain cases it might be possible to decrease further the rate of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The advantages of statistical approach to the evaluation of intracranial pressure variations are discussed </plain></SENT>
