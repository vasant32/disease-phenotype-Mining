<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnostic accuracy of the classic symptoms and signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> in infants and children has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children aged 2 months to 16 years with clinically suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> were eligible for this prospective cohort study at 2 large medical centers between February 2006 and October 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo>, or idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The emergency department physician obtained information on clinical symptoms and signs and cerebrospinal fluid analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>Meningitis</z:hpo> was defined as white blood cell count of 6 or higher per microliter of cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 108 patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>Meningitis</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 58 patients (53.7%; 6 <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> and 52 aseptic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity were 76% and 53% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (among the verbal patients) and 71% and 62% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000613'>Photophobia</z:hpo> was highly specific (88%) but had low sensitivity (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination revealed nuchal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> (in patients without open fontanel) in 32 (65%) of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and in 10 (33%) of the patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brudzinski and Kernig signs were present in 51% and 27% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, respectively, and had relatively high positive predictive values (81% and 77%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bulging fontanel in patients with open fontanel was present in 50% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> but had a positive predictive value of only 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Classic clinical diagnostic signs have limited value in establishing the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> in children and should not be the sole determinants for referral to further diagnostic testing and lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
