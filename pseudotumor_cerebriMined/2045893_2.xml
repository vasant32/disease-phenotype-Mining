<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Threshold values of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) required for maintenance of SSEP's are defined using a mathematical model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model describes loss of amplitude of SSEP's using the form of a dose-response curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amplitude of the SSEP's declined to 50% of control values at a CBF of 15 ml/100 gm/min and a CPP of 20 mm Hg in the normoxic animal; in the presence of mild <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (8 to 9 kPa), a significant increase in these values to 18 ml/100 gm/min and 32 mm Hg, respectively, occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No reliable changes in latency or central conduction time were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that given adequate oxygenation, evoked electrical activity is lost at too low a level of CPP for this parameter to be useful in clinical monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, even mild <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, when combined with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, produces a major risk to neuronal integrity </plain></SENT>
