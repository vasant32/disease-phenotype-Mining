<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ICP and systemic blood pressure were continuously recorded in nine cases of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the four cases demonstrating plateau waves in ICP recording, the latencies of the auditory brainstem evoked potentials (ABEP) measured during the appearance of plateau waves showed no significant differences compared to those measured during the interval phase between two plateau waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the five cases demonstrating B-waves in ICP recording, four cases showed significant (p less than 0.05) prolongation of the V wave of ABEP and three showed significant (p less than 0.05) prolongation of the P15 of somatosensory evoked potentials during the phase of increased ICP level with B-waves compared to those measured during the phase of decreased ICP level without B-waves, produced by external drainage of the cerebrospinal fluid or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that during the appearance of plateau waves there were no significant changes of electrical activity in the brainstem, even though there was a significant reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that in cases with the appearance of B-waves, an increase in ICP frequently affects the electrical activity in the brainstem </plain></SENT>
