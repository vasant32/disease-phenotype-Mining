<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The developments of a telemetric device for monitoring intracranial pressure, the Rotterdam Teletransducer, are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major problem in telemetric pressure sensing devices consists of diffusion of water into the transducer, resulting in unpredictable zero drift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, special attention was paid to bonding techniques for sealing the transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of improved <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30721">epoxy</z:chebi> sealing, active metal brazing and glass bonding are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro tests showed transducers sealed with <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30721">epoxy</z:chebi> resin to be stable for two months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the more complicated techniques of glass bonding and active metal brazing, hermetic seals could be achieved with stable transducers for over one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo functioning of the Rotterdam Teletransducer was tested in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> animal experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in vivo results corresponded to those obtained in the in vitro experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis between epidural and ventricular fluid pressure showed a one to one ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of clinical application of the device in 22 patients are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accurate depth setting of the transducer on the dura, according to the pressure depth curve, was shown to be essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The device has also been used with success for non-invasive fontanelle pressure measurements in infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The depth positioning of the transducer on the fontanelle according to a pressure depth curve is described </plain></SENT>
