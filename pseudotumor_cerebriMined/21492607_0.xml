<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine if use of antibiotic-impregnated shunt (AIS) systems to reduce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1141920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">shunt infections</z:e> in adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> has been cost-effective at one institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adult patients undergoing CSF shunt insertion over a 7-year period at the Johns Hopkins Hospital were retrospectively reviewed (2004-2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2006, a categorical switch to AIS catheters was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before 2006, standard nonimpregnated shunt catheters were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 1-year incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1141920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">shunt infection</z:e> was retrospectively assessed and accounting and billing records were reviewed to determine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1141920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">shunt infection</z:e>-related medical costs for patients undergoing AIS vs non-AIS shunt surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 500 (250 AIS, 250 non-AIS) shunt surgeries were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal-pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>) (n = 378 [76%]), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (n = 83 [17%]), and various obstructive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo> etiologies (n = 40 [8%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1141920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">shunt infection</z:e> was decreased in the AIS (1.2%) vs non-AIS (4.0%) cohorts (P = .0492 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the mean cost per <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1141920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">shunt infection</z:e> was $40,371 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Per 250 shunts placed, the total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related cost was reduced from $321,407 to $203,424 after the conversion to AIS catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AIS catheters were associated with direct cost savings of $47,193 per 100 shunt surgeries performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective cohort study of 500 CSF shunt surgeries performed in adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, this institution's categorical conversion to AIS catheters was associated with a significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related medical costs within the first year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although prospective randomized cost-utility studies are needed to confirm these observations, these results suggest that AIS catheters are cost-effective in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in adult patients </plain></SENT>
