<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is usually considered to result from deficient intracranial absorption of cerebrospinal fluid, but has also been suggested to be caused by decreased cranial venous flow because of increased intrathoracic pressure resulting from intra-abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, cerebrospinal fluid pressure (Pcsf), extracranial venous pressure (Pvf), intracranial venous pressure, and body mass index (BMI) were studied in patients with IIH with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> compared with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> tension-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (CTTH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: The Pcsf and the pressures in frontal veins without (Pvf) and with bilateral compression of the supraorbital branch of the frontal veins and the superficial facial veins (Pvfc), the latter considered to be about equal to Pvfc, were studied in 10 consecutive patients with IIH with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten consecutive CTTH patients were used for controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Orbital phlebography was performed to confirm that the compression of facial veins other than the frontal veins resulted in adequate communication between the frontal vein used for the studies and the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebrospinal fluid pressure was between 200 and 250 mm water in 5 of the CTTH patients and above 350 mm water in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body mass index was &gt;25 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CTTH patients and similar in the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid pressure was similar to Pvfc in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 CTTH patients but significantly greater in 6 of the 10 IIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pvf was similar in the 2 groups and related to BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> tension-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> patients may be prone to have Pcsf &gt; 200 mm water and BMI &gt; 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> because of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> occurred in the present study at Pcsf &gt; 350 mm water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings of Pvfc and Pcsf being similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CTTH patients support the suggestion that the techniques used for measuring intracranial venous pressure are adequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The findings of similar BMI in the CTTH and the IIH patients who differed significantly as to Pcsf refute the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> precedes, and is the cause of, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The difference between Pcsf and Pvfc in 6 of the IIH patients also does not support such a hypothesis but may indicate that IIH is due to deficient intracranial cerebrospinal fluid absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Since a relationship between intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is established and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is not found to cause intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in IIH, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may be suggested to be the primary cause of weight increase in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo>, however, may secondarily increase the preexistent IIH </plain></SENT>
