<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Demographic and outcome data in the era of modern neuroimaging are needed to describe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of children less than 18 years old who were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> between 1977 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> as (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, (2) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or small ventricles, and (3) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrospinal fluid composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The condition might be idiopathic or the result of a nontumor etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients had an initial diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients were subsequently diagnosed with a central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and were excluded from further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 35 patients included 10 patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> and 25 patients with disorders reported to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 10.6 years with a range of 3 to 17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (57%) were female and 13 patients (37%) were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At presentation 4 patients had a visual acuity less than 20/40 in the best eye and 10 patients had visual field deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (49%) had cranial nerve deficits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which resolved with normalization of the intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were obtained on 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had a final visual acuity less than 20/40 in the best eye, whereas six patients had residual visual field deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (33%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic nerve atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no gender predominance, and associated etiologic factors were common in these children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> occurs in some children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Quantitative perimetry and optic nerve examination were more sensitive than visual acuity determination in detecting damage to the visual sensory system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In rare instances the patient diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> will be found after extended follow-up to harbor an intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
