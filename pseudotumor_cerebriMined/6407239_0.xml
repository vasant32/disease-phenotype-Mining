<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Considering the lack of complete agreement of viewpoints concerning the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of ABB indices of CSF at various levels along the brain-spinal axis, an attempt was made to elucidate this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this procedure 82 patients suffering from diseases causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> and spinal pain were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 262 samples of CSF was taken from cisterna magna and from the lumbar region of the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In accordance with the degree of severity of clinical symptoms resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, the patients examined were divided into five groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of examination show irregular differentiation of samples of CSF which is related to the clinical state of the patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the law of thermodynamics of irreversible processes and in particular of the law of increase in entropy, clinical implications following from the results of investigations are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the ABB of CSF as a sign of thermodynamic imbalance of the living system, the author seems a relationship between the results of examination of the investigated system, its thermodynamic state systematisation, probability, and informative function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presented propositions are supported, in the opinion of the author, by results of investigations of ABB in CSF in 227 cases of cranio-cerebral trauma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors of the brain</z:e> </plain></SENT>
