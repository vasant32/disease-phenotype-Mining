<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, the only means of accurately diagnosing and following these patients is with repeated lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that transcranial doppler measurements of pulsatility correlate accurately with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study is designed to assess whether pulsatility index (PI) correlates with ICP in patients newly diagnosed with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with clinical suspicion of IIH were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical suspicion was based on history of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> examinations and imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral arteries were insonated to obtain average PI values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was then withdrawn, and closing pressures were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pulsatility index values were then obtained again, within ten minutes after completing CSF withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PI values were correlated with ICP values, and pre and post CSF withdrawal values were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven patients had elevated opening pressures (average 39 cm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>, range 27-70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The average closing pressure after approximately 30 cc of CSF withdrawal was 11.9 cm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The average PI before CSF withdrawal was 0.95, which dropped to 0.70 after CSF withdrawal (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The change in ICP was found to be correlated with a change in PI (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that PI may be useful for following patients with IIH non-invasively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further study with larger groups and blinded assessments should be useful in better characterizing the accuracy of this technique </plain></SENT>
