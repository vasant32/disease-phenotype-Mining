<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty-two epidural sensors for measuring intracranial pressure were implanted in 38 patients over the last four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sensor is a passive device consisting of an inductance and a pressure sensitive capacitance resonant at about 50 megahertz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study involved 17 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, nine of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, and the remainder included cases of cranial trauma, <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of the sensors failed in patients and were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of these had to be replaced to continue the pressure monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intracranial pressure is still being monitored in 22 patients, while 15 have been lost to follow-up for various reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients have been followed for about a year, and four for two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The baseline drift rate in most sensors is between 1 and 2 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> per day, with a few having greater rates of drift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Calibration errors were found in some of the sensors after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These errors were corrected by direct measurement of the cerebral spinal fluid pressure via lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensors have proven to be a valuable adjunct in the management and diagnosis of neurosurgical patients by simplifying the intermittent and continuous recording of intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was so despite the presence of calibration errors and a drift which necessitated an occasional lumbar puncture for making corrections </plain></SENT>
