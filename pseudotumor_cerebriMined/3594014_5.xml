<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The operations were performed in order to alleviate problems caused by an abnormally raised ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indirect measurements of perilymphatic pressure were made before and after surgery using a non-invasive technique which measures tympanic membrane displacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique proved extremely sensitive and revealed changes in cochlear fluid pressure brought about by changes in the ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results emphasise the need to consider audiological measurements in the context of ICP abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings have important implications in that an audiological technique may be used for the simple and non-invasive serial monitoring of changes in ICP and may even assist differential diagnosis in a number of neurological patients </plain></SENT>
