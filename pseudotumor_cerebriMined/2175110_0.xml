<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 40 children with the hypertensive hydrocephalic syndrome and 67 with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> that had occurred before two years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A study was made of the anamnestic, clinical, ultrasonic and computer-aided tomographic parallels of those conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first group, computer-aided tomography of the brain revealed a moderate enlargement of the cerebrospinal fluid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional ultrasonic examination of the brain via the open <z:hpo ids='HP_0000239'>large fontanel</z:hpo> also demonstrated the widening of the frontal cornua of the lateral ventricles and of the III ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second group children manifested an appreciable enlargement of the cerebrospinal fluid system, while the occlusive character of cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities required surgical treatment (drainage via the shunting system) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A table of the differential diagnosis of the clinical and preclinical symptoms recorded in the two patients' groups is presented </plain></SENT>
