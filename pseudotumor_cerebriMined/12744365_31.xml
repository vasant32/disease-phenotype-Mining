<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and visual deterioration that may culminate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> is caused by venous sinus obstruction in an unknown percentage of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of cerebral venous sinus disease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> and the potential of endoluminal venous sinus stent placement as a new treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine consecutive patients in whom diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> had been made underwent examination with direct retrograde cerebral venography (DRCV) and manometry to characterize the morphological features and venous pressures in their cerebral venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was measured simultaneously in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If patients had an amenable lesion they were treated using an endoluminal venous sinus stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients demonstrated morphological obstruction of the venous transverse sinuses (TSs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were associated with a distinct pressure gradient and raised proximal venous sinus pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients underwent stent insertion in the venous sinuses and reported that their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> improved immediately after the procedure and remained so at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vision was improved in three patients, whereas it remained poor in one despite normalized CSF pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> should be evaluated with DRCV and manometry because venous TS obstruction is probably more common than is currently appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with a lesion of the venous sinuses, treatment with an endoluminal venous sinus stent is a viable alternative for amenable lesions </plain></SENT>
