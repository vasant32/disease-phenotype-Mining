<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neuro-ophthalmologists frequently care for patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), although many questions remain unanswered regarding its diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Friedman-Jacobson criteria for the diagnosis of IIH specify lumbar puncture (LP) opening pressure values that are largely based on experience with little supporting normative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until recently, there were sparse data to define <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values of the LP opening pressure in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo>, the sine qua non of IIH, may not always be present, but the frequency of true IIH without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> is controversial and the threshold for diagnosing it varies among clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concepts regarding the pathogenesis of IIH continue to evolve; venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is certainly implicated even though it is uncertain whether venous sinus stenosis is the cause or effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2010 Jacobson Lecture discusses the evidence for some of the prevailing assumptions about <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lumbar puncture opening pressure, venous sinus stenosis, and the phenotypic continuum between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and IIH </plain></SENT>
