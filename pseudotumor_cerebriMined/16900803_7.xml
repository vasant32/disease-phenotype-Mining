<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Previous reports indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) may cause spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the clinical diagnosis of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) in this population using the modified Dandy criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of clinical data and measurements of ICPs after surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients with spontaneous CSF leaks were surgically treated from 1996 to 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients with CSF pressure measurements, strict adherence to the modified Dandy criteria definitively confirmed a diagnosis of BIH in 8 patients (72%) and a likely diagnosis in the 3 remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean ICP was 31.1 cm H20 (range, 17.3 to 52 cm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>), and 81% of the patients were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> middle-aged women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had signs and/or symptoms of elevated ICP, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (91%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> (45%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (45%), balance problems (27%), and visual complaints (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical repair was 100% successful in leak cessation over a mean follow-up of 14.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with spontaneous CSF leaks fulfill the modified Dandy criteria; thus, this disorder appears to be a variant of BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause of elevated CSF pressures in this group and whether medical or surgical treatments to correct the intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are warranted </plain></SENT>
