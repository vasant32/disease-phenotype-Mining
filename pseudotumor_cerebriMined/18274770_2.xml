<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since a direct non-invasive measurement of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure is not available, it was the purpose of the study to describe the non-invasive determination of the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein pressure as an estimate of an elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 28-year-old female patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo>, nuchal pain and prominent optic discs underwent modified ophthalmodynamometry to determine the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein pressure as surrogate of the intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A Goldmann contact lens with a pressure sensor mounted into its holding ring was placed onto the cornea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pressure was applied to the globe by slightly pressing the contact lens until the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein started to pulsate/collapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite an abnormally high central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein pressure (OD: 17 arbitrary units; OS: 33 arbitrary units), the neurological examination including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was unremarkable on the first day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A lumbar puncture revealed a cerebrospinal fluid pressure of 25 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>, which was at the upper limit of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over the next 2 days, ophthalmodynamometry showed increasing measurements of the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein pressure for both eyes, parallel to elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure measurements by lumbar puncture, leading to the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the cerebrospinal fluid pressure returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels, parallel to a decrease in the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein pressure as determined by ophthalmodynamometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmodynamometry of the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein was helpful in the diagnosis of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e>, with direct lumbar pressure measurement running parallel to the ophthalmodynamometric measurements </plain></SENT>
