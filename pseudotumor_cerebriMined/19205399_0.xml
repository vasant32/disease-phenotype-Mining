<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven healthy volunteers and 168 patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography revealed that there was a great difference in the standing of OD into the vitreous body in different stages of ODD, as evidenced by their comparison with that in the control group (healthy individuals), and a significant increase in the diameter of the optic nerve subtunicary space in patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> regression as demonstrated by ultrasonography leads to a concurrent reduction in the previously increased diameter of the optic nerve subtunicary space and the standing of OD into the vitreous body </plain></SENT>
