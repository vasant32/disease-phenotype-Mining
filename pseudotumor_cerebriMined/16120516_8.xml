<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Catheter studies show that patients with benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) frequently have high pressures in the intracranial venous sinuses proximal to stenotic lesions in the transverse sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These lesions have now been demonstrated on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether they would be visible on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT venography was performed on 10 patients with BIH and compared with 10 controls, matched for age and sex, undergoing CT angiography for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> controls were confirmed to have had ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> at craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a semi-automated technique to develop a profile of the cross-sectional areas along the lateral sinuses and to minimize observer bias, the narrowest point on each side was identified and summated in every subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with BIH exhibited a region of marked narrowing in both transverse sinuses, usually near the junction with the sigmoid sinus, rarely seen in our control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measured cross-sectional areas in these venous outflow tracts were substantially different between patients with BIH and controls (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT venography frequently demonstrates transverse sinus narrowing in BIH </plain></SENT>
