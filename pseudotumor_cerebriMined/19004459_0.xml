<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze retrospectively pediatric cases that were diagnosed and managed in the same institution during the 2002-2006 period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight children (four girls and four boys) with a diagnosis of BIH were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis was 10.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up lasted a mean two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical features were those of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One child had previously had optic nerve sheath fenestration and another one occipitocervical decompression because of an associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0007099'>Chiari I malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One child had a bilateral transverse sinus stenosis on angio-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven children had a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven children were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three children are free of symptoms with the association of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and depletive lumbar puncture (LP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For three others, a lumboperitoneal shunt had to be inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One child is in complete remission after depletive LP only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptoms of BIH disappeared for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight children, including normalization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> present in three children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BIH is a condition that threatens visual prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is assessed by clinical, radiological, and raised CSF pressure criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>First-line treatment is medical (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> at first intention) and surgery is recommended for refractory cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The relationship between BIH and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is less clear than for adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of CSF by LP is an important therapeutic factor </plain></SENT>
