<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In children with nonspecific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, supportive evidence for diagnosis may be required before invasive procedures such as lumbar punctures are performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography of the optic nerves (USON) is a noninvasive examination that can provide information about optic nerve changes, including those resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The applicability of USON in the diagnosis and follow-up of PTC was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Seventeen children were referred to our service because of a clinical suspicion of PTC, suggested by the presence of swollen optic nerve discs and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, without clinical evidence of another cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging results before referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each child was examined with USON while in the supine position and with a 30-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0005191'>head tilt</z:mp> and underwent a lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>USON was repeated on follow-up evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnosis of PTC was confirmed by lumbar puncture in 10 children and ruled out in 6 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, the USON results correlated with an increased opening pressure on lumbar puncture in 11 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We noted an excellent correlation between the clinical results and the USON findings in PTC, and in many cases repeated lumbar punctures could be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>USON is more easily applied than a lumbar puncture, without the accompanying risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may be used as an indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, as well as a follow-up tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are required before the accuracy of USON can be fully established </plain></SENT>
