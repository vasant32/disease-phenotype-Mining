<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the incidence of sleep breathing disorders in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Overnight respiratory monitoring was performed in 22 untreated patients with idiopathic intracranial pressure diagnosed at a tertiary medical center over a two-year period and 12 sex- and age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Breathing measures included heart rate, respiratory rate,oxygen saturation, and continuous end-tidal capnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sleep quality and daily <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> were assessed by self-report questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age of the study group was 32.6±12.2 years and of the control group, 37.0±12.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither group had significant findings of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> or hypercarbia during sleep, and there were no between-group differences in mean carbon dioxide level (patients, 35.8±4.41 mmHg; controls, 37.6±4.38 mmHg; p&gt;0.02) or minimal oxygen saturation (96.35±1.99% and 5.69±1.71%, respectively; p&gt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study group had significantly more events of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi>) per hour of sleep than the control group (1.21±1.38 and 0.92±0.56, respectively; p=0.02), although values were still within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (&lt;5/hr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is not associated with a clinically significant nocturnal breathing abnormality, and hypercarbia is apparently not involved in the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it is possible that a subtle increase in paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi>) events might be sufficient to cause vasodilatation of the cerebral blood vessels, thereby increasing intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> may be appropriate in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> patients, and further studies are needed to clarify this issue </plain></SENT>
