<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basis of the initial loss may be revealed by the rate of sensitivity recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We monitored the contrast sensitivity of seven patients immediately before and after surgical treatment in which a shunt was placed for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, the 13 of 14 eyes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> exhibited the characteristic preshunt loss of sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the first 3 days after shunt placement, sensitivity remained approximately equal to preshunt levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By postshunt days 4 through 6, sensitivity rapidly normalized and remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for up to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the rate and pattern of sensitivity normalization, we conclude that the initial loss represents an interaction of axoplasmic stasis with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> at the level of the optic nerve </plain></SENT>
