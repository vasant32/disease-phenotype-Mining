<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to study the immediate and long-term effects of repeated infusions of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen goats were operated on twice to implant: an epidural latex balloon in each cerebral hemisphere to measure ICP; an electromagnetic flowmeter around both internal maxillary arteries (the only cerebral blood input), after tying the extracranial branches, to measure the CBF; and two femoral catheters to measure blood pressure (BP) and for intravenous infusion (IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three groups of 6 goats each were formed: A) control; the BP and bilateral ICPs and CBFs were recorded under basal conditions and every 4 hours for 3 days after a cold injury (CI) was provoked; B) 20% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> solution 1 g/kg body weight injected every 12 hr starting at 24 hr post-CI; and C) 10.1% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> solution 0.5 g/kg body weight, administered as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">Glycerol</z:chebi>, as compared to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, presents the following major differences among its immediate post infusion effects: a lesser decrease in ICP, but no rebound phenomenon; lesser elevation of BP; CBF increases more gradually and constantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term effects with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> consisted of a rebound phenomenon observed in ICP during the last 12 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 groups, it was observed that CBF increases in relation to the ICP level </plain></SENT>
