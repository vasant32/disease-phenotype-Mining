<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005306'>capillary hemangioma</z:hpo> growing in the lumen of the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old girl had experienced progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fundoscopic examination disclosed bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and high intrathecal pressure, suggesting idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging, including magnetic resonance angiography as well as digital angiography, revealed a 3-cm mass protruding into the superior sagittal sinus lumen above the torcular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: A <z:hpo ids='HP_0005306'>capillary hemangioma</z:hpo> attached to the internal dural wall of the sagittal sinus lumen was microsurgically removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The symptoms resolved in several days and no additional treatment was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> growing into a venous sinus is a rare cause of venous outflow impairment and may generate the clinical signs of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case emphasizes the importance of multiple complementary imaging modalities and the efficacy of a direct surgical approach, which allowed resolution of symptoms </plain></SENT>
