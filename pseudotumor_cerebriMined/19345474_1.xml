<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> is a serious complication of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), we measured VEP in an attempt to evaluate quantitatively the optic nerve damage in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 20 consecutive IIH patients fulfilling modified Dandy criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VEPs were recorded bilaterally and at midline from occipital electrodes using pattern reversal stimuli to each eye separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared to norm values used in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VEP response latencies were usually similar in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were delayed in nine patients (45%) bilaterally and in two additional patients unilaterally (55% of patients had abnormal responses in at least <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VEP amplitudes were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>reduced visual acuity</z:hpo> in both eyes had prolonged VEP latencies, but abnormal records were seen frequently also in cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repeated examinations 6-12 months later revealed similar results in clinically stable patients and improvement of VEP latency in parallel to clinical improvement in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> in IIH is probably preceded by prolongation of VEP responses and the latter may be evidence of optic nerve dysfunction due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
