<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in the treatment of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chart review of 250 patients with suspected IIH revealed 58 women who met our criteria, did not undergo early surgical intervention, and had adequate documentation of visual status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, and weight at the baseline evaluation and at 6 months or longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups based on whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> &gt; or = 2.5 kg occurred during any 3-month interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> grade, visual acuity, and visual field grade at 6 months or longer and the time to improve each were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean time in months to improve one grade for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and visual field in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> was 4.0 versus 6.7 (p = 0.013) and 4.6 versus 12.2 (p = 0.032), respectively, for the 38 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> compared with the 20 patients with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> resolved in 28/38 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (mean, 7.6 months) and 8/20 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (mean, 10.2 months; p = 0.352) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in final visual acuity or visual field between the two groups, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> grade was slightly better in the worst eye in each patient at baseline in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> group (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Weight reduction is associated with more rapid recovery of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and visual field dysfunction in patients with IIH compared with those who do not lose weight </plain></SENT>
