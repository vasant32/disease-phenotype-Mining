<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">Vasodilators</z:chebi> are generally assumed to affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vascular beds including the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated effects of FE-induced (4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>arterial hypotension</z:hpo> on intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) under conditions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and increased intracranial elastance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICP and IOP responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were tested by infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (15 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), and the response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> was tested by elimination and reintegration of soda lime canisters in the breathing circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracranial elastance was increased by infusing mock cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the lateral ventricle (20 +/- 3 ml.h-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Arterial hypotension</z:hpo> induced with FE did not increase ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With increased intracranial elastance, the infusion rate of mock CSF had to be reduced while administering FE to avoid a rise in ICP (p &lt; 0.05 compared with preinfusion value); this indicates a shift on the volume-pressure curve to the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no indicators that cerebral autoregulation or <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity of the cerebral vasculature were affected by FE in this anesthetized porcine model, as speculated from analysis of the time course of delta ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There are, however, indicators of increased intracranial elastance, most likely caused by vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Caution should hence be exercised when FE is administered to patients with increased intracranial elastance </plain></SENT>
