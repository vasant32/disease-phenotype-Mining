<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The overall incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) has been estimated at 1 per 100,000 in the general population, with an increase to 19 per 100,000 among overweight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About 25% of affected patients are asymptomatic until they present with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that PTC would be highly prevalent among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients seeking bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The setting of our study was a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 2-year period, clinical data were collected from candidates for bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A group of the study population was concurrently screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> using fundus imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> images were reviewed by a single neuro-ophthalmologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with abnormal images were referred for neuro-ophthalmic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The imaging group (78% women) had a mean age of 45.4 ± 10.7 years, and the mean body mass index of 47.8 ± 8.7 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High definition nonmydriatic fundus imaging was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 489 patients (91.9%) and abnormal in 43 patients (8.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The subsequent evaluation by the neuro-ophthalmologist revealed ocular abnormalities other than optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in 27 patients (5.1%) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings in 7 patients (1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients (.9%) declined additional evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four patients (.8%) had confirmed optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain magnetic resonance imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 3 underwent lumbar puncture, which confirmed the diagnosis of PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We identified a greater prevalence of PTC overall (.65%) and in the imaging group (.9%) than previously reported or would have been predicted from the current data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although routine funduscopic examination is of limited utility, these findings warrant additional investigation into the utility of, and optimal method for, screening morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients for this co-morbidity </plain></SENT>
