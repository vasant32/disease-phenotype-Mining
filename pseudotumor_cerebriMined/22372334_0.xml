<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a predilection of occurrence in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women of childbearing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is likely related to abnormalities in the balance between production and drainage of cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is made by excluding the known causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the features, possible causes, treatment, and incidence of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as seen in patients attending our Department of Neurology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analysed a group of patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in our Department of Neurology during a twenty-year period (1989 to 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In six patients we confirmed the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of them were females and one was male, the average age of the patients was 32.30 years (22 to 52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The calculated incidence of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in our group was 0.15 per 100,000 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Out of these six persons there were four cases diagnosed in the last five years, changing the calculated incidence to 0.4 per 100,000 persons in this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average body mass index in our patients was 26.33 kg/m2 (20.1 to 31.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suppose that the increased incidence of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in our patients in the last five years has been associated with an advance in diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With literary data, half of our patients were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> or overweighted, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them underwent also hormonal treatment, some had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> and one of them was pregnant (Tab </plain></SENT>
