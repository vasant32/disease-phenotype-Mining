<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to determine the frequency of venous sinus disease and the need for MRV in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have studied 14 patients admitted between 1998 and 2005 in the Neurology Department of the University Clinical Hospital &lt;&lt;Lozano Blesa&gt;&gt; (Zaragoza; Spain) who had been diagnosed of PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the epidemiological and clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MRVs were reviewed and their appearances rated for focal narrowing and signal gaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients had strong signal in both lateral and transverse sinus and their image was considered as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other eight patients showed filling defects on the transverse sinus (focal unilateral narrowing in four cases, one or more signal gaps in four cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of signal gaps in the venous sinus (stenosis/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> or absence of signal) is a frequent finding in patients with PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>That is why we have concluded that this test is important in patients with PC in order to search for a possible etiology and treatment option </plain></SENT>
