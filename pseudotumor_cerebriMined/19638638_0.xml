<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the usefulness of neuroimaging in children with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of children with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and age-matched controls were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> had flattening of the posterior sclera in 61% versus 40% of cases, distension of perioptic subarachnoid space in 65% versus 35%, intraocular protrusion of pre-laminar optic nerve in 17% versus 0%, tortuosity of optic nerve in 30% versus 5%, and an empty sella in 26% versus 5% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of 3 or more of the MRI features is 95% specific in predicting idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed <z:chebi fb="28" ids="38869">general anesthetic</z:chebi> effect on these neuroimaging features are also minimized when multiple features are taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging features can assist in suspecting the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in children, provided caution is applied when interpreting imaging performed under a general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
