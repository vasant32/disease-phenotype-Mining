<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On occasion, both lateral ventricles and the lumbar space become unsuitable for placement of a functioning CSF drainage catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have encountered several such patients and describe our strategy of shunting from the cisterna magna to the pleural space or cardiac atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report a retrospective review of the clinical course of five patients with cisternal shunts and intracranial pressure telemonitoring devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cisternal shunting was able to successfully drain CSF to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pressure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF pressure data collected from those patients indicate that the CSF pressure dynamics in cisternal shunts is similar to that of ventricular shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the cisternal shunting and subsequent high revision rate did result in a significant number of complications and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1141920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">shunt infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Shunting CSF from the cisterna magna in the absence of another suitable drainage site does result in acceptable reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the technique is associated with a high complication rate that may reflect the population of patients in whom this technique is required </plain></SENT>
