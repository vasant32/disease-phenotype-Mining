<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: To test the accuracy of short-term cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure monitoring through a lumbar needle for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> sufferers with BTSS, we prospectively performed lumbar puncture in order to measure lumbar CSF opening pressures and to monitor, for 1 h, the CSF pressure in 48 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> sufferers with BTSS and in 50 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> sufferers with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance of transverse sinuses or stenosis of one transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 48 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> sufferers with BTSS, 18 (37.5%) had elevated CSF opening pressure and abnormal pressure waveforms, but short-term CSF pressure monitoring revealed abnormal pressure waves associated with elevated mean CSF pressure also in 26 (86.6%) out of 30 patients who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> opening pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the 50 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> sufferers with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance of transverse sinuses or stenosis of one transverse sinus had abnormal pressure waves and elevated CSF pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, short-term CSF pressure monitoring through a lumbar needle revealed abnormal pressure waves and elevated mean CSF pressures in the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> sufferers with BTSS who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF opening pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate the accuracy of short-term CSF pressure monitoring through a lumbar needle in estimating CSF pressure; they also highlight that a single-spot opening pressure measurement has a low accuracy for recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> sufferers with BTSS </plain></SENT>
