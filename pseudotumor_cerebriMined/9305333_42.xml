<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found LP shunting to be an effective means of acutely lowering intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> improved in 82% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 14 eyes with impaired visual acuity, 10 (71%) improved by at least two lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Worsening of vision occurred in only <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 28 eyes with abnormal Goldmann perimetry, 18 (64%) improved and none worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of serious complications was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The major drawback of LP shunting was the need for frequent revisions in a few patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reason for poor shunt tolerance in certain individuals is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In PTC, LP shunting should be considered as the first surgical procedure for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> at presentation or with intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After shunting it is important to identify patients who are shunt intolerant </plain></SENT>
