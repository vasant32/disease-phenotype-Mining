<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even radiological features are confusing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With clinical signs of increased intra-cranial pressure (ICP), decompressive surgery becomes life-saving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, resection of the involved <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> tissue is unnecessary and may lead to permanent residual deficits that otherwise can be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODOLOGY: We present a series of eight patients with focal deficits and/or raised pressure symptoms wherein a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> was made preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinico-radiological picture and outcome has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients had focal deficits and five had raised ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had long standing visual deterioration in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Radiology showed irregular enhancement in two and concentric rings in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The deep grey matter was involved in one and cortex in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Biopsy/decompressive surgery and resection of lesion improved the sensorium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, but focal deficits persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients died after being discharged in a conscious state, and one died in hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High index of suspicion is required to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Unexplained long standing clinical features, radiology that has contrast enhancement patterns and mass effect (dissociation between contrast enhancement and mass effect) that is unusual for <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> should raise the suspicion of such non-neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For patients with minimal mass effect with focal deficits, open/stereotactic biopsy from multiple areas of the lesion is preferable for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Those presenting with mass effect, decompressive craniectomy and biopsy from the lesion is preferable than attempting complete resection especially in and around the eloquent areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A second look surgery to resect the lesion can always be undertaken once histopathology suggests a neoplastic etiology and rules out a demyelinating lesion </plain></SENT>
