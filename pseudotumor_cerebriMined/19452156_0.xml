<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Children presenting with either a diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of IIH, who were undergoing lumbar puncture under a <z:chebi fb="28" ids="38869">general anaesthetic</z:chebi> for pressure measurement, were recruited to study the relationship between pCO2 and CSF pressure measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A rise of end-tidal pCO2 by 1 kPa causes a rise of CSF pressure by 3.5-12 cm H20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Controlling of pCO2 is important when measuring CSF pressure to prevent misdiagnosis and over treatment of patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
