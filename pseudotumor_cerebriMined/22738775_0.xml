<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of literature supporting venous sinus stenosis as a causative etiology for many patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent series have documented improvement in the pre- and post-stenosis venous pressure gradient as well as clinical symptoms after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concomitant real time intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has not been previously described during venous sinus stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A woman in her twenties presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial neuropathies</z:e> with an MRI revealing high grade right transverse sinus stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lumbar puncture demonstrated an opening pressure &gt;55 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her vision and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial neuropathies</z:e> continued to worsen despite ventriculoperitoneal shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A parenchymal ICP monitoring wire was placed, revealing ICP persistently &gt;70 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She underwent venography and a pre- to post-stenosis pressure gradient of 55 mm Hg was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent sinus stenting resulting in a near immediate reduction in her ICP from 70 to 20 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> within 30 s after deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Her ICP completely normalized within 24 h of stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A case is presented of severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> neurologic decline despite CSF diversion secondary to venous sinus stenosis that resolved following venous sinus stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of real time ICP monitoring during venous sinus stenting </plain></SENT>
