<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> was detected in both groups receiving ammonia, it was of a greater magnitude in portacaval anastomosis rats (80.94% + 0.17% vs. 80.24% + 0.09%, p &lt; 0.01), resulting in the development of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
