<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both diseases a large quantity of CSF exists: equilibrated by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in IdICH with high ICP and not equilibrated by brain pressure, and the ventricles are enlarged in IdNPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same anatomical structure involved in both diseases is the ventricular wall and this represents a true barrier, a glial-ependymal barrier and it acts as a barrier only in connection with the difference between the pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous course of both diseases suggests that an open glial-ependymal barrier protects the brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
