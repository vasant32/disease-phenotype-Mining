<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between perilymphatic pressure, indirectly measured by tympanic membrane displacement, and mean intracranial pressure defined either clinically or by direct measurement has been examined in 58 patients (aged 5-77 years), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumours</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> and head injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most consistent results were obtained in young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the technique was not suitable when the stapedial reflex was absent as a result of middle ear/brainstem dysfunction and did not reflect intracranial pressure when the cochlear aqueduct was not patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This pilot study suggests that the tympanic membrane displacement technique may provide a useful non-invasive method for serial monitoring of intracranial pressure in young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> or benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
