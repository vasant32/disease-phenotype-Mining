<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The condition is well characterized, with intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, visual obscurations, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> as dominant features, mainly affecting <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the advent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography and increased use of cerebral angiography, there has been recent emphasis on the significant number of patients with IIH found to have associated nonthrombotic dural venous sinus stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has led to a renewed interest in endovascular stenting as a treatment for IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the assumption that venous stenosis leads to a high pressure gradient that decreases CSF resorption through arachnoid villi requires further evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this paper, the authors analyze the published results to date of dural venous sinus stenting in patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also present a case from their institution for illustration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological mechanism in IIH requires further elucidation, but venous sinus stenosis with subsequent intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> appears to be an important mechanism in at least a subgroup of patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 78% had complete relief or improvement of their main presenting symptoms after endovascular stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Resolution or improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> was seen in 85.1% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endovascular stenting should be considered whenever venous sinus stenosis is diagnosed in patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
