<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 3D spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) volume scans as a tool for quantification of optic nerve head (ONH) volume as a potential marker for treatment effectiveness and disease progression in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional pilot trial comparing 19 IIH patients and controls matched for gender, age and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each participant underwent SDOCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A custom segmentation algorithm was developed to quantify ONH volume (ONHV) and height (ONHH) in 3D volume scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Whereas peripapillary <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer thickness did not show differences between controls and IIH patients, the newly developed 3D parameters ONHV and ONHH were able to discriminate between controls, treated and untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both ONHV and ONHH measures were related to levels of intracranial pressure (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest 3D ONH measures as assessed by SDOCT as potential diagnostic and progression markers in IIH and other disorders with increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SDOCT may promise a fast and easy diagnostic alternative to repeated lumbar punctures and could therefore ease monitoring of treatment or disease progression </plain></SENT>
