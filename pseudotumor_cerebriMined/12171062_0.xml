<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the obtained data were analyzed and possible relationships between the parameters of CSF dynamics and the clinical data were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correlative analysis of the obtained data was performed and the main mechanisms of compensation of BIH syndrome were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients of group A disturbances of CSF absorption system with high level of CSF outflow resistance (R) and secondary elevation of brain elastance (EL) were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients of this group venous disorders were of secondary nature and appeared in a later period of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients of group V showed increased intrasinus pressure, which correlated to high R and EL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients of group G we found the signs of CSF hyper-production with high level of EL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased R in patients of this group seemed to be a secondary reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The investigation identified the main stages of evolution and compensation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the patients with BIH syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The obtained data may be used in optimizing the conservative therapy and indications for lumboperitoneal shunting </plain></SENT>
