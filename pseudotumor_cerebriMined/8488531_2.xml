<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Massive bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> due to deep venous system <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are extremely rare and poorly documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case with computed tomographic evidence of both <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and infarction of the whole deep venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A previously healthy 30-year-old woman who had taken oral contraceptives for 3 years complained of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and transient visual obscuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three months later, she suddenly became <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> and was found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She rapidly worsened, became decerebrate, and died within 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Noncontrast computed tomographic scan showed the spontaneous hyperdensity of the thrombosed deep veins and a massive bilateral centrobasilar hypodensity suggestive of a deep venous system infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> can masquerade during 3 months as benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and then make a dramatic extension to the deep cerebral veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It illustrates extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the deep venous system as a possible cause of rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and decerebration and stresses the importance of computed tomographic scan to show both the thrombosed veins and the venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, which allows delineation of the deep venous system territory </plain></SENT>
