<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission, she exhibited bilateral optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and no visual disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her cerebrospinal pressure was 440 mmH2O, but we detected no abnormalities in the CSF, blood tests, brain MRI or MRV </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> reduced the cerebrospinal pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that examination of the optic fundi is sufficient to diagnose both IIH without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and IIH with atypical symptoms </plain></SENT>
