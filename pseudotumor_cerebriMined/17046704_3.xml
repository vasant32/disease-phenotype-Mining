<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether a 10-Item Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement increases the capacity of the 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) to capture self-reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visual dysfunction</z:e> in patients with neuro-ophthalmologic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey to examine the characteristics of a 10-Item Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement to the 25-Item NEI-VFQ-25 in a cohort of patients with neuro-ophthalmologic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 10-Item Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement was designed previously by our research group by survey and focus-group methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the NEI-VFQ-25 and 10-Item Supplement were administered concurrently to patients and disease-free control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-contrast visual acuities with patient usual distance correction were measured with the use of Early Treatment Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Study (ETDRS) charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diagnoses for patients (n = 215) included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo>, multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> gravis, ocular motor palsies, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339143" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid eye disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scores for the 10-Item Supplement had a significant capacity to distinguish patients vs disease-free control subjects that was independent of the NEI-VFQ-25 composite score (odds ratio in favor of patient vs control status for 10-point worsening in Supplement scores: 2.7 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6, 4.6]; P &lt; .001, logistic regression models that account for NEI-VFQ-25 composite score, age, and gender) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visual dysfunction</z:e> (binocular Snellen equivalents worse than 20/20) had significantly lower mean scores (9-21 points lower); these differences remained significant after accounting for age and gender (P &gt;or= .001, linear regression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Supplement items and composite scores demonstrated appropriate degrees of internal consistency reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The 10-Item Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement demonstrates a capacity to capture self-reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visual dysfunction</z:e> beyond that of the NEI-VFQ-25 alone, which supports validity for this new scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of the 10-Item Supplement in clinical trials and epidemiologic studies will examine its capacity to demonstrate treatment effects in longitudinal cohorts </plain></SENT>
