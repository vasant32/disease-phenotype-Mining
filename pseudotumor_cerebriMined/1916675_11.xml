<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that brain water measured in rats after hepatic devascularization (portacaval anastomosis followed in 24 to 48 hr by ligation of the hepatic artery) increases with the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> develops in this model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004448'>fulminant hepatic failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a fiberoptic pressure transducer, intracranial pressure rose from 3.3 +/- 1.1 mm Hg to 23.7 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (mean +/- S.E.M.) by the time the corneal reflex was lost; intracranial pressure was unchanged in control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediately after ligation of the hepatic artery, intracranial pressure was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and remained stable until the last hours of the experiment, when it progressively rose, suggesting a loss of intracranial compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, sudden and short episodes of marked increases in intracranial pressure (greater than 50 mm Hg) not related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity markedly decreased cerebral perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid artery blood flow, an indirect measure of cerebral perfusion, decreased 29% +/- 12% by the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time elapsed from ligation of the hepatic artery until loss of the corneal reflex (range 340 to 940 min) was related to the change in cerebral perfusion pressure, suggesting that an increase in systemic arterial pressure at the time of the initial rise in intracranial pressure may result in an <z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>increased length</z:mp> of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this animal model, widely used to study the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002480'>hepatic encephalopathy</z:hpo>, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> invariably appears in the terminal phase of the course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The development of intracranial pressure waves may be an indication that brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> is imminent </plain></SENT>
