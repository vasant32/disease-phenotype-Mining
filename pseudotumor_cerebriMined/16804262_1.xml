<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nature of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) represents a risk factor for progressive optic nerve damage and structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0000479'>abnormalities of the retina</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: We measured the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients followed with the diagnosis of IIH who had no or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> to search for possible structural alterations in the retina for diagnostic and prognostic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Case-control prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 12 women followed and treated with the diagnosis of IIH in our clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The selection criteria were the, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> optic nerve, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> visual fields or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> (Grade 1-3) by Humphrey perimeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Randomly assigned, age-matched 12 healthy women were taken as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer thickness was evaluated with scanning laser polarimetry and both eyes were studied for each case in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean ages of the patient and the control groups were 34.58+/-4.2 and 34.42+/-5.7 years respectively (P=0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of disease was 5.5+/-3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some parameters related to RNFL thickness were found to differ significantly between patients with IIH and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Namely superior ratio (P=0.007), inferior ratio (P=0.039), superior-nasal ratio (P=0.025), maximum modulation (P=0.01) and symmetry (P=0.006) were lower in the patient group than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Scanning laser polarimetry might be a good adjunct for determining possible structural affects of IIH on the retina in patients with no or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
