<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Recent reports of the dramatic antitumor effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (RA) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (APL) have renewed interest in the oncologic indications for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric tumors</z:e> are responsive to RA in vitro, which provides additional rationale for a phase I evaluation of RA in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> that is refractory to standard therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase I trial of RA administered orally twice daily for 28-day treatment courses was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cohorts of at least three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric cancer</z:e> patients were entered at successive RA dose levels (from 45 to 80 mg/m2/d) until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was consistently observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of RA was 60 mg/m2/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of eight patients at the 80-mg/m2/d dose level developed reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> that necessitated discontinuation of the agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients with APL achieved complete remission (CR), whereas no patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> had objective responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated a relatively short terminal half-life for RA (45 minutes), with diminution in plasma levels after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The MTD and recommended phase II dose for RA in children is 60 mg/m2/d given twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reversible <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> toxicity related to RA-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> is dose-limiting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two children with APL achieved a CR to RA, which supports the inclusion of pediatric patients in clinical trials that evaluate the use of RA for patients with APL </plain></SENT>
