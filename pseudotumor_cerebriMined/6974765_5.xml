<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Volumes initially were smaller than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but at review five patients showed a significant increase in ventricular size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Persisting small ventricular volume correlated with persisting symptoms and signs and with persisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This supports the view that patients with benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may be implicated in the pathogenesis, perhaps via a neuroendocrine disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that weight reduction may be an important component of treatment </plain></SENT>
