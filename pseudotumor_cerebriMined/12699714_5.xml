<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They include similar demographics, clinical presentation, and response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is an eightfold increase in the incidence of significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> in patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings and our observation in a subgroup of patients with failed ACM decompression, we suggest that these disorders are interrelated in a group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The physiopathology is that of craniocephalic disproportion, i.e., a disproportion between the skull and the brain, due to a small skull or posterior fossa (like in ACM) and/or an engorged brain (like in IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This will occasionally lead to tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The craniocephalic disproportion will alter the brain compliance and lead to the symptomatology </plain></SENT>
