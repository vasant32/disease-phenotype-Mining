<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report four hydrocephalic children with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> extending along the ventricular catheter of an obstructed CSF shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients exhibited massive CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> along the ventricular catheter, yet they manifested neither ventricular enlargement nor apparent periventricular CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> despite increased intraventricular pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested ventricular tautness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient, who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>dilated ventricles</z:hpo> with periventricular CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, displayed CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in a limited area along the ventricular catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Replacement of the obstructed peritoneal catheter of the shunt resulted in rapid improvement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the three patients with massive CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, however, a small lesion remained in the subcortical white matter along the ventricular catheter as demonstrated by computerized tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging 3 to 5 years after shunt revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that shunt obstruction may result in massive CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> along the ventricular catheter in hydrocephalic children who have ventricular tautness after installation of the shunt causing irreversible although usually asymptomatic damage to the affected area of the brain </plain></SENT>
