<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: The etiology of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> may be linked through increased 11β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35350">hydroxysteroid</z:chebi> dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim was to characterize 11β-HSD1 in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretory [choroid plexus (CP)] and drainage [arachnoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>)] structures, and to evaluate 11β-HSD1 activity after therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted in vitro analysis of CP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> and a prospective in vivo cohort study set in two tertiary care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adult female patients with active IIH were studied, and 22 completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intervention: Fasted serum, CSF, and 24-h urine samples were collected at baseline, after 3-month observation, and after a 3-month diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in urine, serum, and CSF <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> (measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 11β-HSD1 and key elements of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> signaling pathway were expressed in CP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (14.2±7.8 kg; P&lt;0.001), global 11β-HSD1 activity decreased (P=0.001) and correlated with reduction in intracranial pressure (r=0.504; P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CSF and serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> remained stable, although the change in CSF <z:chebi fb="11" ids="16962">cortisone</z:chebi> levels correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (r=-0.512; P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in IIH is associated with a reduction in global 11β-HSD1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Elevated 11β-HSD1 may represent a pathogenic mechanism in IIH, potentially via manipulation of CSF dynamics at the CP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although further clarification of the functional role of 11β-HSD1 in IIH is needed, our results suggest that 11β-HSD1 inhibition may have therapeutic potential in IIH </plain></SENT>
