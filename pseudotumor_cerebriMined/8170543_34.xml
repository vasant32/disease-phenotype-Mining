<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the efficacy of CSF diversion for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) in patients from six different institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients underwent a total of 73 lumboperitoneal shunts and nine ventricular shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 14 patients remained "cured" after a single surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average time between shunt insertion and shunt replacement was 9 months, although 64% of shunts lasted less than 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shunt failure (55%) and low-pressure <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> (21%) were the most common causes for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vision of most patients improved (13) or stabilized (13) postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, three who had initially improved subsequently lost vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six had a postoperative decrease in vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients improved in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> but worsened postoperatively in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four lost vision despite apparently adequate shunt function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Shunt failure with relapse of PTC occurred as late as 7 years after insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CSF diversion procedures have a significant failure rate as well as a high frequency of side effects </plain></SENT>
