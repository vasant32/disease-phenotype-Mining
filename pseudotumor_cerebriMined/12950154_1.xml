<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyze the development and occurrence of the idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and consequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in a family affected with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 15 members of the same family and found six of them affected with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, which was accompanied with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> as a repercussion of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was diagnosed on neurological and radiological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual examination to establish <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> included fundoscopy, visual acuity, visual field testing, and ultrasonography of the optic nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The construction of a family tree and detailed examination of 15 family members revealed idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with visual disturbances, even <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amaurosis</z:e>, and different stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001133'>visual field constriction</z:hpo> in three members of the family: the mother and her two daughters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to the symptoms of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, and the presence of transient visual obscuration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, in three other members of this family (aged 16, 17, and 25 years), we considered a presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and the need for thorough follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Medical data on the family grandmother, who died 34 years ago, suggested that she also had symptoms of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the patients underwent surgical treatment by a lumbo-peritoneal shunt operation worsening of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is very important to include idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and recognize it in early stages to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Current successful therapeutic approaches and close follow-up of such patients require teamwork of neurologists, ophthalmologists, and neurosurgeons </plain></SENT>
