<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though considered to be a relatively safe drug, use of ATRA can lead to several side effects such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PC) </plain></SENT>
