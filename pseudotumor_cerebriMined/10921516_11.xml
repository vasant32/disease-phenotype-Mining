<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology was identified in 28 (77.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common predisposing factor was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle-ear infection</z:e>, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 36 cases seen, 26 presented with the classic picture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure; 8 children had intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and 2 had fundoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrospinal fluid pressure initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four children resolution of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> occurred with removal of the causative agent or appropriate treatment of the underlying condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 8 of 17 patients intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> resolved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> therapy and in 22 of 24 patients it resolved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subnormal visual acuity, narrowing of visual fields, or both were present on the initial examination in 10 patients; 2 of them, who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo>, have permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four additional patients presented a transient, mild impairment of visual acuity during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms the wide clinical spectrum and the difficulties encountered in diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A wide variety of etiologic associations should be investigated to provide definitive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Loss of visual function is the only serious complication </plain></SENT>
