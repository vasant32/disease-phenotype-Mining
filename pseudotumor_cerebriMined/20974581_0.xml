<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The causes underlying idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To identify disease-related biomarkers that could offer a new insight into IIH pathology, we analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 18 patients with IIH and 18 controls using two-dimensional fluorescence differential in-gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found six proteins that were upregulated in IIH (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element-binding protein 1, zinc-alpha-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, immunoglobulin heavy constant alpha 1 [IGHA1], alpha-1-antitrypsin [SERPINA1], serotransferrin, haptoglobin) and four proteins that were downregulated (hemopexin, angiotensinogen, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin-D</z:chebi>-binding protein, transthyretin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The validity of our approach was confirmed for one candidate protein (angiotensinogen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To account for a dependency from blood-CSF barrier function, the ratio of angiotensinogen and albumin CSF-to-serum quotients (Qang/Qalb) was determined, which confirmed the downregulation of angiotensinogen in IIH (p = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Previous studies showed the intrinsic renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) to regulate choroid plexus blood flow and CSF production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altered levels of angiotensinogen could indicate an imbalance of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in IIH that may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
