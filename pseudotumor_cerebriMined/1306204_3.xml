<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuous CSF withdrawal gives better clinical results and is more effective in controlling intracranial pressure than intermittent drainage (50% vs 13% successes respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results obtained with continuous drainage against a steady positive pressure and with a pre-arranged pressure ("tidal drainage") are almost similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However an outflow resistance 3-5 mmHg higher than diastolic level of ICP represents a rational approach to the problem </plain></SENT>
