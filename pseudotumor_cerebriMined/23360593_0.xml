<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: Neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (NBD) involves the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system; peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement is not often reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NBD is quite common in adult patients and occurs rarely during childhood and adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Young patients may share symptoms and signs of NBD with other neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ophthalmological disorders</z:e> (e.g. idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>); thus, making the differential diagnosis difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging is mandatory and necessary for a correct NBD diagnosis but in children radiological examinations are often difficult to perform without sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From 1971 to 2011, 130 patients aged &lt;=16 years have been reported with NBD, according to retrospective surveys, case series, and case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The origin of the reported cases met the well-known geographical distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD); the mean age at presentation of neurological findings was 11.8 years, with male gender prevalence (ratio, 2.9:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We considered in detail the neuro-ophthalmological features of the 53 cases whose neuroimaging alterations were described with an assigned radiological pattern of the disease (parenchymal: 14 cases, non-parechymal: 35 cases, and mixed: 4 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 19/53 patients (36%), neuro-ophthalmological symptoms anticipated any pathognomonic sign for a BD diagnosis, or only occasional aphtae were recalled by the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Family history was positive in 17% of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was reported in 75% of the patients; in those presenting with cerebral vascular involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was combined to other symptoms of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> was the most frequently reported ophthalmological finding, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of systemic steroids in 93% of patients, often combined with other immunosuppressive drugs (especially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical recovery or improvement was documented in the large majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nine subjects had definitive alterations, and one died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Based on our review and personal experience, a delayed diagnosis, and the consequently delayed immunosuppressive treatment, may favour permanent sequelae, in particular, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
