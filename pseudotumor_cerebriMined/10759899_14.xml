<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the spectrum of diagnoses, the use of CT scans of the brain, and pharmacological treatments in patients presenting to a pediatric emergency department with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> as the chief complaint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 1-year retrospective chart review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children who presented to the emergency department with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> as the chief complaint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients (0.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pediatric emergency department visits, mean age = 9.3 years) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> included 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (8.5%) and 2 tension <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> (1.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the secondary nonneurological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and respiratory illnesses (n=37, 28.5%), while the majority of the secondary neurological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> included 26 posttraumatic (20%), 15 possible ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunctions (11.5%), and 3 cases of aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (2.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurological etiology in 9 of these children (6.9%) was found to be serious (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo>, proven ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, and aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients could not be etiologically classified, either because no specific etiology was found or their discharge diagnoses could not clearly explain the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 10% (5/53) of the CT scans of the head that were performed showed new abnormal findings including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> secondary to ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction (2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> (1), and skull fracture (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients (32%) were treated pharmacologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine of the 42 treated patients (93%) were given over-the-counter <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi>, and 9 (21%) were given prescribed <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> in the pediatric emergency department were secondary to concurrent illness and minor head trauma, and required no pharmacological treatment or only treatment with minor <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a small minority of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> were secondary to serious neurological conditions, which required immediate medical attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scans showed new abnormalities in a minority of patients and should be reserved for those with neurological diagnoses such as head trauma and ventriculoperitoneal shunt, as well as for those patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> with no clear etiological explanation, and for those with high-risk medical conditions, such as hypocoagulabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future prospective studies are needed to assess the efficacy of the various pharmacological treatments in this population </plain></SENT>
