<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We implemented ventricular infusion studies on 33 patients suspected of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (iNPH), benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) or occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (HOC) in order to confirm shunt indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial scope was to study <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> supply during infusion tests to exclude further violation of already vulnerable brains during ICP elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraventricular infusion was performed via ventricle catheters with the ICP tip sensor, while brain tissue oxygenation was measured with intraparenchymal Raumedic PTO probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 15 out of 23 (65%; 8 NPH, 2BIH, 5 HOC), pO(2) increased constantly (average 140%), while brain temperature decreased (range: 0.2-4.5Â°C) during the infusion studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another six patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> values remained largely stable during the infusion studies (4NPH, 1BIH, 1HOC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral deoxygenation during infusion tests occurred only in two patients (1NPH, 1HOC).Overall cerebral oxygenation and temperature inversely correlated well with some temporary delay regarding oxygenation state as a consequence of cerebral temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Probably, this effect is a consequence of reduced cerebral metabolism caused by local cooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that such cooling is mediated via the large basal arteries and suggest that such a pathophysiology, ICP-controlled local cooling, might offer a new option for brain protection (e.g. in an ICP crisis) </plain></SENT>
