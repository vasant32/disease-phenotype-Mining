<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven cats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> (25 mg/kg), intubated, and ventilated with nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> in oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and mean pulmonary artery pressure (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) were continuously recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A double 19-gauge needle was inserted into the cisterna magna; ICP was continuously monitored from one needle and the other was used to increase and maintain ICP at 27 +/- 4 mm Hg by infusion of pH-adjusted Ringer's <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After control measurements were taken, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> was given intravenously in each cat when ICP was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infusion of 96 +/- 12 micrograms (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> (approximately equal to 33 micrograms/kg) <z:mp ids='MP_0004876'>reduced MAP</z:mp> 35-45% for 2.5 +/- 0.8 min when ICP was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and for 2.0 +/- 0.6 min when ICP had been increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When initial ICP was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> produced a small (2.2 mm Hg) but statistically significant increase in ICP and decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When ICP was initially elevated, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> produced a larger increase in ICP (5 +/- 1 mm Hg) and a proportionately larger decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
