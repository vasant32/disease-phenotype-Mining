<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the relations of intracranial pressure (ICP), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) and brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) in 44 patients with traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> who were admitted to our hospital from June 1990 to February 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 30 males and 14 females, with age range from 9 to 67 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the abnormal BAEP could reflect the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> head injury and was related to ICP and serum CK levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When ICP &gt; 30 mmHg (4kPa), the abnormality of BAEP was more obvious than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05); the serum CK levels were also elevated markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with ICP over and below 4kPa, the rate of abnormal BAEP was 38.46% and 77.78% respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum CK level in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group or in the group with moderate abnormality of BAEP was significantly different from that in the group with severe abnormality or lack of BAEP (274.8 +/- 98.24 U/L vs 705.3 +/- 364.27 U/L; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the ICP returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and the BAEP normalized too, but the serum CK level decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that BAEP may provide some indirect evidences for the relevant biochemical and biophysical changes after the occurrence of traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and an important clinical index for judging the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
