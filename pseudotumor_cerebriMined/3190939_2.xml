<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> and one patient with benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging, using a chemical shift selective double spin echo sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 3 of the 16 patients, abnormalities were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one patient with bilateral symptoms, signal hyperintensity and swelling of the right side of the chiasm were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another patient the optic nerve was found diffusely enlarged with only a marginally increased signal in the second echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the third patient an area of signal hyperintensity and swelling was seen in the left optic nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patient with BIH the subarachnoid space which surrounds the optic nerves was enlarged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even using this refined pulse sequence, avoiding the major artefact in imaging the optic nerve, the chemical shift artefact, lesions were only shown in 3/16 (19%) of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the presented chemical shift selective double spin echo sequence may be of great value for detection of retrobulbar lesions </plain></SENT>
