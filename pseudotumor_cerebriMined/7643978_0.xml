<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After deflation of the balloon there was a rebound of the intracranial pressure (ICP) to values in the range 30-89 mm Hg when critical thresholds of time and compression had been exceeded during the period of compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A time versus cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) graph indicated a CPP threshold of about 50 mm Hg and time threshold of about 6 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within these limits the critical CPP varied as a function of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ICP rebound had an approximately exponential time course with an initial rapid rise levelling off towards a final plateau in about 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The final value was dependent on the time of compression but independent of the CPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A transtentorial pressure gradient was induced during the compression phase and reestablished after the decompression when a rebound of ICP developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hydrostatic compression by means of infusion of fluid into the subarachnoid space was followed by a rebound of ICP in only 2/21 of the experiments in spite of time and CPP parameters which crossed the critical thresholds defined in the balloon compression experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that the rebound phenomenon is related to an ischaemic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference in incidence of rebound in balloon compression and hydrostatic compression can probably be accounted for by a greater depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in the former case because of a direct compressive effect on the vascular bed by the balloon </plain></SENT>
