<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that most if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> etiologies result in an increase in intracranial venous pressure as a final common pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 10 patients with PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five had dural venous outflow obstruction as demonstrated by venography, and the five remaining patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pressure measurements, made during venography in eight patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed elevated pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pressure measurements in the superior sagittal sinus ranged from 13 to 24 mm Hg (mean, 16.6 mm HG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with obstruction tended to have a high pressure gradient across the stenotic segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dural venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005168'>elevated right atrial pressures</z:hpo> (range, 6 to 22 mm Hg; mean, 11.8 mm Hg), which were transmitted up to the intracranial venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endovascular techniques, including angioplasty and infusion of thrombolytic agents in some cases, improved outlet obstruction from a hemodynamic perspective but were ineffective in consistently and reliably alleviating the clinical manifestations of PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in both groups tended to respond well to conventional CSF diversion procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that elevated intracranial venous pressure may be a universal mechanism in PTC of different etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This elevated venous pressure leads to elevation in CSF and intracranial pressure by resisting CSF absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism leading to venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the presence of outflow obstruction is obvious, the etiology of increased intracranial and central systemic venous pressure in PTC remains obscure </plain></SENT>
