<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is an established clinical practice in managing patients with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICP elevation although the clinically accepted way of measuring ICP remains invasive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the invasive nature of ICP measurement obviates its application in many clinical circumstances such as diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose a noninvasive diagnostic tool for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IH) based on the morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) waveforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We mainly compare two types of IH detection methods: one based on the traditional supervised learning approach and the other based on the semi-supervised learning approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our simulation results demonstrate that the predictive accuracy (area-under-the-curve) of the semi-supervised IH detection method can be as high as 92% while that of the supervised IH detection method is only around 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the predictive accuracy of the pulsatility index (PI) based IH detection method is as low as 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the predictive accuracy is a widely used accuracy measurement, it does not consider clinical consequences of necessary and unnecessary treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we have adopted the decision curve analysis to address this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The decision curve analysis results show that the semi-supervised IH detection method is not only more accurate, but also clinically more useful than the supervised IH detection method or the PIbased IH detection method </plain></SENT>
