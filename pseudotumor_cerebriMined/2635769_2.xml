<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion pressures (CPP) of less than 50 torr are associated with marginal cerebral blood flow and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with a group of 7 children who survived long period with CPP of less than 50 torr during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study group was identified through a retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> head-injured patients admitted to Cardinal Glennon Memorial Hospital for Children between 1984 and 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients presented had sustained intracranial pressure of greater than 20 torr which was resistant to conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> for at least 24 h and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had documented CPP of less than 50 torr for more than 30 min during that time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these 7 children: 3 made good recoveries; 2 are moderately disabled, and 2 are vegetative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither the CPP nor the length of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> was an accurate predictor of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It seems likely that these children are a subset of those previously defined as having resistant intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and that, as a group, they may have benefited from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is also apparent that, in this group, low CPP was not indicative of irreversible brain damage or brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
