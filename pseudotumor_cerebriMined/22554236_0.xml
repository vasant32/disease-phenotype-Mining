<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old Caucasian woman who suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000132'>menorrhagia</z:hpo> was started on triptorelin, a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three days later, she developed gradually worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> accompanied by bilateral visual disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Examination revealed bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enlarged blind spots</z:e> on her visual fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was made and confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We recommend that patients at high risk (women who are overweight and of reproductive age) who are using any gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue (for example, triptorelin) should be periodically monitored for the possible development of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
