<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The model is developed using small strain poroelasticity that includes non-linear permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The axisymmetric model is solved for four ventricle shapes, an ellipsoid, a 'peanut' shape, a 'cross' shape and a 'bone' shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of fluid pressure, velocity and content in the deformed parenchyma for a blocked aqueduct provides new qualitative insight into hydrocepahlus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some observations are offered for two forms of cerebrospinal fluid flow abnormality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The model is extended to include a gravitational term in the governing equations and the effect of hydrostatic pressure variation is considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of a fully 3D simulations are described for two horn-like lateral ventricles and one case with two lateral ventricles and a third ventricle </plain></SENT>
