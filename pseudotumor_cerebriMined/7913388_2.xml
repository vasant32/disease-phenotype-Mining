<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) and 99Tcm-HMPAO cerebral scintigraphy in detecting the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> by pressure transmission using a previously validated model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 20 New Zealand rabbits, cerebral blood flow velocities of basilar artery and carotid siphon were simultaneously monitored in baseline conditions and during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> by pressure transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was induced by progressive steps of 5 mmHg, for a 5 min duration by elevating a saline infusion bottle connected to the subdural space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In baseline conditions, significant correlations were found between basilar artery resistive index and 99Tcm-HMPAO uptake in brain stem, r = 0.5 (p &lt; 0.05) and posterior cerebral areas, r = 0.78 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> equal to the diastolic arterial pressure with a cerebral perfusion pressure of 22.8 +/- 12.7 mmHg significantly decreased the basilar artery blood flow velocities and global 99Tcm-HMPAO cerebral uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At this level of intracranial pressure, few correlations between the two methods were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCD detected relatively high blood-flow velocities in the carotid siphon appearing to result from proximal cerebral artery vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transcranial pulsed Doppler provides data about haemodynamic changes such as hypoperfusion, vascular resistance increase in the basilar artery territory and vasospasm of the carotid siphon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>99Tcm-HMPAO scintigraphy, which has not yet been studied during intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, gave immediate information on local cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral scintigraphy demonstrated a significant diffuse and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> decrease in cerebral blood flow, without dissociation between supratentorial and infratentorial territories, and tissue perfusion deficit owing to arterial vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TCD provides emergency investigation in patients with severe head injuries or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>99Tcm-HMPAO complements TCD in cases of vasospasm and in determining an area of perfusion tissue deficit </plain></SENT>
