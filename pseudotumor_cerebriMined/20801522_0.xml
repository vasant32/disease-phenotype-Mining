<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> grade in the operated eyes and the contralateral nonoperated fellow eyes in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 78 patients underwent ONSF, and 20 patients served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Charts of patients with IIH who had ONSF at the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics were reviewed for age, gender, body mass index, and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Optic disc photographs were graded by a masked observer using the Fris√©n <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> grading scale at preoperative baseline and postoperatively at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to examine the change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> grade in both operated and nonoperated eyes at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (52 women and 10 men) with a mean age of 32 years (range, 13-57 years) underwent unilateral ONSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> for operated and nonoperated eyes was 3 and 2, respectively, at preoperative baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively the grade was 2 in each eye at 2 weeks (P&lt;0.0001 and &lt;0.0002 for operated and nonoperated eyes, respectively), 1 in each eye at 3 months (P&lt;0.0001 for both operated and nonoperated eyes), 1 in each eye at 6 months (P&lt;0.0001 for both operated and nonoperated eyes), and 0.5 and 1 for operated and nonoperated eyes, respectively, at 12 months follow-up (P&lt;0.0001 for both operated and nonoperated eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in grade of disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> or reduction of disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> on the basis of age, gender, or body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral ONSF significantly decreases the grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in both ipsilateral (operated) and contralateral (unoperated) eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The reduction of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and the stability of visual field in the contralateral (nonoperated) eyes suggest that bilateral ONSF may not always be necessary in patients with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> due to IIH </plain></SENT>
