<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A motion-compensated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> pulse sequence was used to create diffusion maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) in 12 patients fulfilling conventional diagnostic criteria for idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and in 12 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly larger <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was found within subcortical white matter in the patient group (mean, 1.16 x 10(-9) m2/s) than in the control group (mean, 0.75 x 10(-9) m2/s), whereas no significant differences were found within cortical gray matter, the basal nuclei, the internal capsule, or the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of 7 patients with increased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> in subcortical white matter also had increased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> within gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurement of diffusion coefficients in vivo demonstrated increased local water mobility within subcortical white matter in 7 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> that otherwise appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to assess the clinical significance of these observations </plain></SENT>
