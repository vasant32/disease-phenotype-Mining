<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> likely also exists among individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial pressure (ICP) but the prevalence is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to identify patients with incidental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ICP and describe their characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 240 adult patients who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) with contrast at our institution between September 2009 and September 2011, 44 had isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> without further substantial imaging abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed for symptoms of increased ICP, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) constituents and opening pressure (OP), and reason for brain imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 37 were excluded for confirmed or possible idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the remainder, 5 had CSF-OP ≤25cmH(2)O without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, and 2 did not have measured ICP, but had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> or symptoms of increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Imaging was re-interpreted to assess for signs suggestive of elevated ICP and to characterize the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were women (mean age: 41, mean BMI: 37.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CSF contents were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but OPs were at the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (22-25cmH(2)O) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Indications for MRI/MRV included query pituitary abnormality (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (4), and anomalous-appearing optic nerves (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six had short <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> and an empty sella; 1 had long <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> and no empty sella; 1 had flattening of the posterior sclera; 2 had prominence of peri-optic nerve CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> exists in patients with ICP≤25cmH(2)O, but is likely uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CSF-OP was at the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in our patients, who also had other radiologic signs suggestive (but not specific) of chronically-raised ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Findings of bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> on imaging should prompt funduscopic examination for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
