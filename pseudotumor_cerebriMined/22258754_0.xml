<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its clinical characteristics in the pediatric population are distinct from those in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> were identified from the neurosurgery and neurology databases at Children's Hospital, Birmingham, AL, USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were collected from the ophthalmology, neurology and neurosurgery departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average age of patients at diagnosis was 11.4 years (range 3-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average opening pressure of lumbar puncture (LP) was 37 cm of water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients responded well to therapeutic LPs and medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurosurgical interventions included intracranial pressure monitoring and shunt insertion in nine patients </plain></SENT>
