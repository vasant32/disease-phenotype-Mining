<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (ICP greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg) was present acutely in 12 patients and absent in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT diagnoses of diffuse swelling (DS) was present in 12 patients, and diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> recovery, neuropsychological dysfunctioning was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICP elevations showed more intellectual and memory losses than those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICP elevations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No neuropsychological differences were found between patients with DS and DAI injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest secondary brain insults caused by intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may be more disruptive to long-term neuropsychological functioning than diffuse lesion type </plain></SENT>
