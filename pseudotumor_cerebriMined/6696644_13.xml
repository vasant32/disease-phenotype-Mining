<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018378" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Guillain-Barr√© syndrome</z:e> was studied with serial measurements of pressure-volume index, CSF outflow resistance (Ro), and CSF production rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were comparable to findings in previous cases of idiopathic pseudotumor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although Ro was elevated and progressively diminished as the pseudotumor syndrome improved, the extent of elevation in Ro was inadequate to account for raised CSF pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest an alternative explanation for pseudotumor based on raised effective venous pressures at points of CSF outflow that are passively reflected in raised CSF pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A parallel rise in vascular and CSF pressure may also explain why patients with pseudotumor tolerate such high intracranial pressures </plain></SENT>
