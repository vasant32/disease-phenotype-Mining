<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This increase in Ra raises CSF pressure (CSFP), which rise provokes a redistribution of arteriovenous pressures across the cerebrovascular bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The end result is a measurable increase in cerebral blood volume, compression of the ventricular system and compromise of the convexity subarachnoid space, which further increases CSF outflow resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, a new steady state CSFP is attained </plain></SENT>
