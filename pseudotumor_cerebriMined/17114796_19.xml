<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CSF is thought to flow continuously from the site of production in the ventricles into interconnected spaces; i.e. cisterns and subarachnoid spaces (SASs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the SAS of the optic nerve is defined by a cul-de-sac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, it is not evident how local CSF might recycle from that region to the general SAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concept of free communication of CSF has recently been challenged by the description of a concentration gradient of beta-trace protein, a lipocalin-like <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> d-synthase (L-PGDS), between the spinal CSF and that in the SAS of the optic nerve, indicating diminished local clearance or local overproduction of L-PGDS here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In fact, computed cisternography with a contrast agent in three patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and asymmetric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> demonstrate a lack of contrast-loaded CSF in the SAS of the optic nerve despite it being present in the intracranial SAS, thus suggesting compartmentation of the SAS of the optic nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concept of an optic nerve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">compartment syndrome</z:e> is further supported by a concentration gradient of brain-derived L-PGDS between the spinal CSF and the CSF from the optic nerve SAS in the same patients </plain></SENT>
