<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the variation of plasma ADH concentration after an experimentally induced increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure (PCSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experiment was performed in controlled environmental conditions to avoid pain or stress-related ADH release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 15 rats (10 experimental, 5 control) a cannula was positioned in the left cerebral ventricle: in the experimental group artificial CSF was infused at a rate of 0.6 (microliter/min for 6h: this manoeuvre, in a separate set of animals obtained an increase from 13.03 +/- 0.8 to 25.4 +/- 2.5 cmH2O of PCSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same conditions were reproduced in the control group without infusion into lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experiment, plasma ADH had fallen significantly in the experimental group from 18.9 +/- 4.8 to 11.9 +/- 2.3 pg/ml (p &lt; 0.05), while it was not changed in the control group (from 25.5 +/- 13.7 to 23.7 +/- 16.2 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heart rate, arterial pressure, plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> and osmolality, did not change significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma K+ fell significantly in both groups: from 5.5 +/- 0.6 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 (p &lt; 0.05) and from 5.4 +/- 0.7 to 4.3 +/- 0.15 mEq/l (p &lt; 0.05) in the experimental and control group respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, checked only at the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that a relationship exists between PCSF variations and plasma ADH concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We believe this relationship is due to the pressure receptors in the cerebral ventricles or in structures connected to it, such as the inner ear, and we hypothesize the existence of a control system of body fluids, more diffused than though to be, up till now </plain></SENT>
