<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TS stenoses have been observed in a high proportion of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stent placement to remove this potential obstruction to venous outflow has been proposed as a treatment option for patients with IIH refractory to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with refractory IIH evaluated for venous sinus stent placement at a tertiary care center was retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen female patients with IIH were evaluated for sinovenous stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moderate sinus stenoses with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intrasinus pressures were found in 3 patients and therefore stent placement was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had elevated intrasinus pressures (pressure gradient across stenosis, 11-50 mm Hg), which decreased following unilateral TS stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headaches</z:hpo> improved or resolved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stented patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> resolved completely or almost completely in 8 patients and significantly improved in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no major periprocedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this small case series, restoring the patency of stenotic venous sinuses with a stent in patients with refractory IIH resulted in symptomatic improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of this procedure should be evaluated in a randomized controlled study to determine its role within the armamentarium of therapeutic options for patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
