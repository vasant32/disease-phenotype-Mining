<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral hemodynamics were evaluated by transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery flow velocities decreased, and the pulsatility indices increased markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Particularly, the waveform of the left middle cerebral artery showed a systolic peak, suggesting an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Actual intracranial pressure was 7 mm Hg, and the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was 51 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These abnormal Doppler signals seemed to be caused by a compromise in CPP and to be aggravated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>Hypovolemia</z:hpo> aggravates a reduced cerebral blood flow caused by a compromised CPP, and the waveform of TCD in a case of hypovolemic shock should be differentiated from intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
