<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities consisting mainly of prolonged interpeak latencies were detected in one third of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is speculated that the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for these auditory brainstem-evoked abnormalities are stretching-compression of the cochlear nerve and brainstem caused by the intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and/or primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> of the same structures due to the benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Normalization or improvement was noticed in the majority of the patients after management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the number of patients in this study is small, it is felt that the diagnostic and prognostic value of this test needs further evaluation </plain></SENT>
