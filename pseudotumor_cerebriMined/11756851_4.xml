<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine if confocal scanning laser (CSL) tomography can quantify optic disc topography in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000538'>pseudopapilledema</z:hpo> (PP) and to contrast the regional topography of the optic disc in PP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-dimensional optic disc images from 10 PP patients PP and 17 PTC patients were obtained using the Heidelberg <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> Tomograph (HRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two conventional HRT parameters, volume above the reference plane and volume above the surface, were used to quantify global disc elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, local topography was determined at 100 microm intervals along eight meridians at 100 to 1700 microm from the disc center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The global and local measures of disc topography in the two groups were compared statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant between group differences were detected for both global measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional analysis revealed vertical symmetry and horizontal asymmetry in PP and PTC as well as significant between group differences in peripapillary height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CSL tomography can quantify disc elevation in both PP and PTC and may be useful for differentiating disc <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in PP and PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The volume of the disc above the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> surface is greater in PTC than in PP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, most of the difference in elevation between the two groups occurs over the disc rim and peripapillary retina </plain></SENT>
