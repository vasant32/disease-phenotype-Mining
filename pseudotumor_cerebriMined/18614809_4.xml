<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The brain's arachnoid membrane with granulations is an important biological barrier whose responsibilities include the transmission of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the regulation of pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Membrane disturbance may cause changes that are difficult to replicate with animal models, suggesting the need for a model using human arachnoid membrane with granulations for the study of conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors detail the development and validation of an ex vivo model of CSF outflow across human arachnoid granulations (AGs) as an approximation of in vivo conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human AGs were perfused at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiological pressure in physiological and nonphysiological directions for permeability data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent particle perfusion with electron microscopy identified outflow pathways through the AGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This human ex vivo model demonstrated in vivo properties of unidirectionality, particle transport, and ultrastructure, similar to our 2005 in vitro model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average baseline hydraulic conductivity in the physiological direction (n = 20) was 1.05 +/- 0.15 microL/min/mm Hg/cm(2) compared with 0.11 +/- 0.03 microL/min/mm Hg/cm(2) in the nonphysiological direction (n = 3) under statistically equivalent (P = 0.46) average <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiological pressures (5.88 +/- 0.22 mm Hg and 6.14 +/- 0.23 mm Hg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ex vivo model is feasible and herein demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings agree with in vivo CSF outflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This model increases understanding of the clearance not only of CSF but also of metabolites through the arachnoid membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional evidence suggests, but does not yet prove, that CSF outflow may occur in a similar manner in the arachnoid membrane adjacent to the granulations, in addition to the flow through the AGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is a topic for further investigation </plain></SENT>
