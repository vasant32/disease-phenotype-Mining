<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complications were incurred by a total of 19 patients (6.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients (1.7%) died following the procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> due to intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>: one from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, one from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and three from increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The three patients who died without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had marked intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> at the time of biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five patients who died harbored a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> multiforme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surviving 14 patients (4.7%) with complications suffered increased neurological deficit due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10 (3.3%), the deficit was mild and/or transient; in the other four (1.3%), a major deficit was incurred which markedly affected the remainder of the patient's life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mortality or major morbidity was seen in 3.0% of patients and minor morbidity in 3.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stereotactic biopsy is a very effective procedure with a complication rate significantly lower than that of craniotomy (particularly in the population of patients selected for stereotactic biopsy), but in a small number of patients the outcome is devastating </plain></SENT>
