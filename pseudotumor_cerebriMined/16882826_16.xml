<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the clinical features and spectrum of diagnoses in children with "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mimics," those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic deficits but without cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to describe patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mimics and to determine if clinical features predict benign diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> consult team registered a prospective consecutive cohort of 143 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> presentations suspicious for cerebrovascular disease from November 2003 to November 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was ruled out (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mimics) were reviewed for clinical features and diagnostic test results and were classified "benign" if there was no structural brain lesion and there was an expectation of complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 143 cases evaluated for suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 30 (21%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mimics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Presenting signs included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (n = 11), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (n = 9), mental status change (n = 6), focal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> (n = 14), and focal sensory change (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had "benign" diagnoses (3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, 3 psychogenic diagnoses, 3 musculoskeletal abnormalities, 1 delirium, and 1 episodic vital sign changes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had "not-benign" diagnoses (3 reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0006859'>posterior leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> syndrome, 3 neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, 2 vascular anomalies, 2 inflammatory disease, 2 intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, 2 epilepsy, 2 metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1 tumor, 1 drug toxicity, and 1 idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Except for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, there were no significant differences in presentation or risk factors between benign and not-benign cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many disorders mimic childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>History and clinical presentation often do not distinguish the one third of patients with benign disorders from the two thirds with more serious problems, necessitating timely comprehensive investigations, especially brain MRI </plain></SENT>
