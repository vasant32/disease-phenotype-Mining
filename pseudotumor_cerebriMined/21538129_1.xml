<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is a disorder associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> without evidence of a space-occupying lesion and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrospinal fluid constituents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is rare in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the visual outcome of children with IIH and the risk of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This single-center observational retrospective cohort study included 90 children younger than 18 years of age who satisfied the modified Dandy criteria for the diagnosis of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon follow-up, the treatment was discontinued when patients were free of symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, transient visual obscurations or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, and when examination revealed no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were visual acuity and visual field outcomes as well as risk of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 30.65 months (range 1.15-172.6 months, standard deviation 27.47 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Special grading scales were devised for visual acuity and visual field scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean visual acuity score improved from 4.7 ± 0.62 to 4.87 ± 0.44 (p = 0.003).The mean visual field score improved from 3.41 ± 0.8 to 3.52 ± 0.75 (p = 0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate was 23.7%, and the risk of recurrence was highest within the first 18 months after diagnosis of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These study results suggest that pediatric patients with IIH have a favorable visual outcome in terms of both visual acuity and visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If there is any recurrence, it is most likely to occur during the first 18 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
