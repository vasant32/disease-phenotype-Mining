<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumour cerebri</z:e> (PTC), which is important as it illustrates the effects of chronically raised CSF pressure, the relationship between PTC and venous sinus obstruction and the successful treatment of PTC using a venous sinus stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 38-year-old woman, previously diagnosed with PTC and unsuccessfully treated 10 years previously re-presented with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imaging revealed dramatic changes of chronically raised CSF pressure and a defect in the anterior cranial fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CSF leak was corrected surgically and a lumbo-peritoneal shunt inserted to correct a large postoperative subgaleal CSF collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct retrograde cerebral venography (DRCV) demonstrated venous sinus obstruction due to a filling defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a pressure gradient and a high superior sagittal sinus pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The venous sinus obstruction was successfully treated with a venous sinus stent and the lumbo-peritoneal shunt was removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chronically raised CSF pressure in untreated cases of PTC may cause widespread changes in the skull, which in this case, culminated in a spontaneous CSF leak despite relatively mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and visual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cases of PTC secondary to venous sinus obstruction may be successfully treated using venous sinus stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The index of suspicion for venous sinus stenosis or obstruction should be raised in the investigation of patients with PTC </plain></SENT>
