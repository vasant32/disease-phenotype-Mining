<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have observed a relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> in women with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively examined a population of women with IIH to determine an association between <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in the year before diagnosis and the presence of visual field deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cross-sectional study included women who enrolled in the Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> Registry (IHR) between 2003 and 2005 and met study criteria for IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from mailed questionnaires and review of registrant medical charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence ratios were used to assess the relationship between weight measures during the year before diagnosis and abnormal visual field findings at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population consisted of 159 females aged 13-64 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean weight of the study population 1 year before diagnosis was 92 kg (standard deviation [SD] 27 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> was 5 kg (SD 13 kg) over the year before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visual field findings at diagnosis were abnormal in 84% (n = 122) of study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no association between visual field deficits and body mass index (BMI), <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, or percent change in ideal body weight (IBW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Weight change over the year before diagnosis was not associated with visual field deficits at diagnosis in this registry population of women with IIH </plain></SENT>
