<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri syndrome</z:e> (PTC) is a clinical entity of unknown etiology affecting mainly young, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major morbidity factor in this condition is the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e>, initially considered to be low, but now known to affect a significant proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: We describe a case of PTC in a young, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> black women who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, transient visual blurring and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, there where no other relevant clinical findings, namely other pathologies and history of medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An extensive analytical workup was negative and the CSF showed no abnormalities, aside from increased pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI was also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical course was progressively worse, consisting of rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> associated with an intracranial pressure of over 850 mmH2O, despite treatment with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi>) in therapeutic dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eventually, the patient needed the rapid implantation of a lumboperitoneal shunt to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, and went on to make a nearly full recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major series of PTC, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo> has been reported to occur in a significant percentage of patients, and cases have been described in which a catastrophic course with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> to near <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> has led to the introduction of the designation of 'malignant' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that such cases, although rare, need to be recognized as the malignant end of the spectrum of PTC, and that their management constitutes a neurological emergency </plain></SENT>
