<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She underwent imaging studies and a left frontotemporal craniotomy that revealed a cystic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_252'>oligodendroglioma</z:mpath> in the suprasellar cistern and spread of neoplastic cells to the spinal leptomeninges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> showed little response to maximum radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and the patient died from complications of high-dose chemotherapy 2 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postmortem examination of the brain and spinal cord revealed diffuse meningeal infiltration by neoplastic cells and no evidence of an intraparenchymal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002282'>heterotopias</z:hpo> were noted at several sites along the brain base, adding circumstantial support to the theory that leptomeningeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> are derived from ectopic glial tissue in the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
