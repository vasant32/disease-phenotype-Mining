<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied diffusion tensor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DTI), a technique able to detect cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, to the study of patients with BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A quantitative regional analysis of diffusion parameters (trace and relative anisotropy) was conducted by comparing five BIH patients and six healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A small but significant increase in anisotropy accompanied by a small but significant decrease in trace was found in the putamen and head of the caudate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were demonstrated in the thalamus, cerebral white matter or cortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings support other recent work that suggests cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> is not a factor in the pathogenesis of BIH </plain></SENT>
