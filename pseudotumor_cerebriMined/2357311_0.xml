<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each of the methods of monitoring has its advantages and disadvantages and the use of one method over others is usually the preference of the neurosurgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is the responsibility of the nurse to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each device in order to strengthen patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Again, the major benefits of the bolt are a low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate and easy insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Problems associated with its use of which the nurse should be aware are a tendency for a dampened waveform that gives an inaccurate pressure reading requiring irrigation that may or may not clear the catheter, and the inaccurate readings given by the bolt at high pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subdural catheter can be used for long-term monitoring; however, baseline drift has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ventricular catheters have a mixed bag of results according to research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They are the most accurate of the methods used and enable cerebrospinal fluid to be drained, thereby lowering ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the catheters appear to have a higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is debatable, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some researchers advocate the prophylactic use of antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A closed drainage system should be used and if the device is used for longer than 4 days, the device should be changed and care should be taken to prevent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The devices currently in use have been presented and patient outcomes discussed using medical research, as none was available from the nursing literature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
