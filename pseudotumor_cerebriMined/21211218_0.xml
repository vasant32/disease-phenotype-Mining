<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: It was a retrospective case series study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data of BIH patients were investigated retrospectively, including symptom, fundus findings, visual acuity and visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was a retrospective case series study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of 67 patients were female (46 cases, 87%), of which 71.7% were over-weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While ocular symptoms were reported in 94.0% (63 cases) of cases in whole disease course, 28 cases (41.8%) primarily presented with ocular symptoms, including transient bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo>, visual deterioration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> was found in 65 cases (97.0%), of which 54 cases (80.6%) were bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some patients showed unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (11 cases, 16.4%)and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal visual acuity was found in 95 eyes (70.9%), of which 35 eyes (26.4%) were below 20/200 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visual field abnormality was found in 89.8% of 49 tested cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common visual field lesion was the enlargement of the blind spot (82 eyes, 83.7%), followed by general constriction in 24 eyes (24.5%), nasal step in 17 eyes (25.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000603'>central scotoma</z:hpo> in 9 eyes (9.2%), Bjerrum <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotoma</z:hpo> in 22 eyes (22.4%) and arcuate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotoma</z:hpo> in 14 eyes (14.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BIH is not really "benign", especially from the viewpoint of optic nerve function </plain></SENT>
