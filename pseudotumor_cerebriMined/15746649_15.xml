<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis: IIH results in part from inadequate drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resulting from thrombotic obstruction to CSF resorption-outflow, favored by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>-hypofibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and assessed serologic coagulation measures in 65 women (64 of them white) with IIH, PCR in 102 healthy white female controls (72 children, 30 age-matched adults), and serologic measures in the 30 adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 65 patients, 37 (57%) were found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e>; 16 (43%) were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt; or = 30 to &lt; 40), and 19 (51%) were extremely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt; or = 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 65 women with IIH, 25 (38%) were homozygous for the thrombophilic C677T MTHFR mutation, compared with 14% of controls (14/102) ( P = .0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombophilic high concentrations of factor VIII (&gt;150%) were present in 9 of 65 (14%) IIH cases, compared with 0 of 30 controls (0%) (Fisher's p [p f ] = .053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increased concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> A (&gt; or = 35 mg/dL), associated with hypofibrinolysis, was present in 19 of 65 IIH cases (29%), compared with 3 of 30 controls (10%) (p f = .039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IIH occurred in 18 of 65 IIH patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> contraceptives (28%), in 6 patients taking hormone-replacement therapy (9%), and in 5 pregnant subjects (8%) </plain></SENT>
