<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with a diagnosis of IIH underwent OCT examination before and after lateral sinus stenting, between March 2006 and April 2008, in Timone Hospital's Ophthalmology Department (Marseille, France) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had criteria for IIH (International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Society, 2004) and sinus abnormalities were diagnosed using three-dimensional rotational <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, a direct retrograde cerebral venography with manometry was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used the Cordis PRECISEÂ® RX Nitinol Stent system (ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>10136245-3, Johnson &amp; Johnson), 30-40 mm in length and 8 mm in diameter, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> placed by a single operator via a femoral venous puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each eye, the mean <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer thickness was noted using the RNFL Thickness (3.4) strategy, before stenting, and three times after stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other parameters considered were age, sex, weight, height and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant decrease in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer thickness was observed after stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This parameter was considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 3 months after stent placement for eight of ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Even though this pathology remains misunderstood, we observed a significant decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in IIH after lateral sinus stent placement, suggesting that high intracranial venous pressure could play a role in this pathology </plain></SENT>
