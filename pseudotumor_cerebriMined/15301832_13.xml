<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study asked what incites the development of a new daily persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 175 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> were prospectively identified and observed by the author </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 40 (23%) with a new daily persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients had no significant prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (43%) had the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of their symptoms during an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, over half had positive Epstein-Barr virus serology at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (23%) manifested minor head injuries at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of their symptoms, yet had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> examination and neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was also associated with surgery (four patients) and high-altitude camping (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In five patients, no specific etiologic factor could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients were initially identified as having idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, yet their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> persisted despite the normalization of their intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were observed in episodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patients who abruptly developed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of new daily persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in childhood is typically associated with a physiologic stress such as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, head trauma, or post-surgery </plain></SENT>
