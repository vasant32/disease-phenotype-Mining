<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The duration of presenting complaints ranged from 4 days to 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A detailed ophthalmic evaluation and neuroimaging were done on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients were found to have intracranial pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients had pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> and one patient had benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We reiterate that AACE has a small but significant association with intracranial disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging is a definite need in cases which cannot be proved to be either Type 1 or 2 </plain></SENT>
