<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IH) and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> initial computed tomography (CT) scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent angiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with IH secondary to a determined disorder were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients were included, 12 patients had MRI/MRV or angiography findings compatible with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> and the remaining 34 patients had no vascular pathology on neuroimaging studies and were considered to have PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No clinical or auxiliary findings differed between the two groups except for younger age, which delineated the PTC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> died during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both were agitated, had a relatively rapid course of symptom progression, and a CSF pressure of over 40 cm water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> can be identified in 26% of patients presenting with symptoms and signs typical of PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may be impossible to differentiate between patients with and without <z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> if MRI/MRV or angiography are not performed in this scenario </plain></SENT>
