<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>12 cats were studied with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi>-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. six cats were subjected to intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> by cisternal infusion of saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Energy failure occurred at an average AVDO2 of 8.4 +/- 3.2 vol% (+/- standard deviation) (range 4.7 to 14.7 vol%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> at the point of metabolic failure averaged 1.45 +/- 0.6 vol% and extended over a narrower range (1.0 to 2.9 vol%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an additional six cats, ICP was raised to the threshold of metabolic failure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> was then instituted (pCO2 10 to 18 torr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the six cats experienced a drop in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two of these animals, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> resulted in a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> of 1.1 vol% or less and in metabolic failure as evidenced by a fall in phosphocreatine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> of less than 2 vol% is correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and that the safety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> in the setting of increased ICP can be monitored by the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
