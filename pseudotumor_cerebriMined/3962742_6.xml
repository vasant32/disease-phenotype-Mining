<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The origin and pathomechanism of vegetative disturbances in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> are not completely clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since some of these alterations in vegetative functions may well be attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes in sympathetic activity, we initiated a study to investigate this modality in experimentally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiments were performed on 51 cats, anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi>, immobilized and artificially ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compound electrical discharges of the left vertebral, cardiac and renal sympathetic nerves, ECG, EEG, end-tidal <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>, systemic arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure were recorded on a polygraph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> was simulated by the injection of 1-5 ml of fresh, autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mock cerebrospinal fluid was also injected as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that in induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, not the blood itself but the intracranial pressure elevation might be responsible for the strong increase in sympathetic efferent activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the direct recording of the electrical activity of the three sympathetic nerves, we were able to verify the sympathetic overactivity underlying the cardiovascular disturbances during intracranial pressure elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding the mechanism of the overactivity, most probably not the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, but the mechanical distortion of the medulla could be the adequate stimulus of the sympathetic overactivity and the Cushing response during intracranial pressure elevation </plain></SENT>
