<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is recognised as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorder</z:e> mainly affecting <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between IIH and serum leptin level in 15 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients and compare the results with those for 16 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 15 non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher serum leptin level was found in patients with IIH than in controls (p&lt;0.0001), and this did not correlate with body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum leptin levels were significantly associated with BMI in both control groups (p&lt;0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional factors must therefore be involved in the phenomenon of serum leptin increase beyond <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cause can only be hypothesised, but it seems that the origin is central, probably hypothalamic </plain></SENT>
