<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several centres that perform liver transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004448'>fulminant hepatic failure</z:hpo> have experience of patients who have not regained consciousness despite adequate graft function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some of these, decerebration because of elevation in intracranial pressure was thought to have occurred intraoperatively or in the early post-operative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004448'>fulminant hepatic failure</z:hpo> who were transplanted had extradural monitors inserted before operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure had been controlled prior to transplantation and rose during the pre-clamp phase of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels fell during the anhepatic phase but rose again during the reperfusion phase (p = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, from the induction of anaesthesia to the reperfusion phase there was a significant increase in mean intracranial pressure (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cerebral perfusion pressure fell after induction of anaesthesia from a median 54 mmHg (range 46-62) to a median 35 mmHg (range 19-49, p less than 0.001) in the pre-clamp phase and remained low throughout the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the first 10 hours after transplantation, three patients had further episodes of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> requiring treatment and it is important that monitoring should be continued through this period </plain></SENT>
