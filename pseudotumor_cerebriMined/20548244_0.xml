<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A small cup-to-disc (C:D) ratio is an established risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0007634'>nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if a small C:D ratio was present in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) as a potential risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in that disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 52 charts of patients diagnosed with IIH at Michigan State University from 1990 to 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (55 eyes) met diagnostic inclusion criteria and had undergone fundus photography of sufficient quality to allow assessment of the C:D ratio after optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> had become minimal or resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C:D ratio was measured from the digitized photographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were placed into rank order categories (0.1 unit intervals) and compared to published normative C:D data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average vertical C:D ratio was 0.143 (SD 0.061) in the right eye and 0.127 (SD 0.056) in the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average horizontal C:D ratio was 0.145 (SD 0.053) in the right eye and 0.133 (SD 0.053) in the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IIH group rank distribution data were compared to published normative C:D ratio data (chi-square test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In each case, the IIH population had a statistically significantly smaller C:D ratio (P &lt; 0.0001) compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The C:D ratio in our IIH population was smaller than that in published control populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A small C:D ratio may lower the threshold for developing optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, or other mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
