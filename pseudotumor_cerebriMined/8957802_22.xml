<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using phased-array local coils, 3-mm coronal T2-weighted fat-suppressed fast spin-echo images were obtained with an in-plane resolution of &lt; 0.39 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optic nerve and its sheath were clearly differentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An enlarged, elongated subarachnoid space around the optic nerve was demonstrated in patients with BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-resolution MRI of the optic nerve offers additional information which may be of value for diagnosis and in planning and monitoring treatment </plain></SENT>
