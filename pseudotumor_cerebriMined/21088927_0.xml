<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pilot study was undertaken in a single, tertiary referral centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> that have undergone laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in our unit were collected from our prospectively maintained bariatric database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional information was obtained via telephone questionnaires and review of medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four female patient with a mean age of 32 years (range 29-39 years) and mean pre-operative body mass index of 46.1 kg/m(2) (range 38.2-54.0 kg/m(2)) underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding between June 2006 and July 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 19.8 months <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients reported either total resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or significant improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, with a mean improvement in pain score of 76.3/100 (range 55-95) on a analogue pain score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> at follow-up was 64.1% (range 50.1-88.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no complications or mortality in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding represents an effective and safe treatment for idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> associated with morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have shown good results both in terms of symptom resolution and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, whilst avoiding alimentary tract diversion procedures in these young female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A randomized, controlled trial can be justified on the basis of this initial pilot study </plain></SENT>
