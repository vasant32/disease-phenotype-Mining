<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The changes in the two consistent components of epidural pressure pulse wave (EDP-PW), P1 and P2 waves, and mean velocity of common carotid blood flow (CBFV) were studied in 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> to investigate the origin of th the amplitude change in these components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The amplitudes of P2 wave increased progressively with the rise of EDP, but those of P1 wave remained nearly invariable at EDP of more than 20-30 mmHg which is incompatible with the changes in CBFV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Jugular vein compression caused in rapid rise of EDP and a proportionate increase in the magnitudes of both waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>Hyperventilation</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> administration caused a disproportionate reduction in the amplitudes of P2 wave with a fall of EDP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> at high EDP (more than 40 mmHg) caused a mild fall of EDP and some increase in the amplitudes of P2 wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the variations in the amplitudes of P1 wave reflect the changes in vascular resistance of the large intracranial conductive arteries, while those of P2 wave result from the changes in the volume of the cerebral bulk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in the amplitudes of P2 wave induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> at high EDP may suggest a defective autoregulation of the cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
