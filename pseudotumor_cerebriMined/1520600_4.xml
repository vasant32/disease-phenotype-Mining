<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For clinical evaluation, the following criteria were used: neurological--<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, ophthalmological--visual acuity, visual field, ophthalmoscopy and psychic--memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient was assigned 2 categories of results expressed by: neuropsychic and ophthalmological scores which were statistically processed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following conclusions related to the aim of our paper can be drawn: I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors: pregnancy (8% of cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (15%), generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or located in the pelvic region+operated on (6%), hormonal treatment (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> (12%), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> (6%)); II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical course was significantly favourable for: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (51% of cases), defects of visual acuity (54%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The long-lasting effects of the treatment applied showed: recovery (for the 2 parameters) in 27% of patients and improvement with sequelae for one and/or the other parameter in 73% of the cases; III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the more significant prognostic criteria were the ophthalmological symptoms and signs at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ophthalmological sequelae (visual acuity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo>) are important factors in the prognosis of the disease and represent predictors for the surgical management </plain></SENT>
