<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical presentation and monitor a 3-month course using frequent optical coherence tomography (OCT) evaluations, visual field testings and lumbar opening pressure measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal study of 17 patients with newly diagnosed IIH and 20 healthy overweight controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripapillary <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickness (RT) measurements (Stratus OCT-3, fast RNFL 3.4 protocol), and Humphrey visual field testing were evaluated at regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeat lumbar puncture was performed at final visit (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic delay was 3 months and initial symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (94%), visual blurring (82%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete clinical remission was achieved in 65%, partial in 29% and unchanged symptoms in 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total average RNFLT and RT decreased significantly during the follow-up period (p &lt; 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in RNFLT and RT correlated with improvements in visual field mean deviation (MD) (RNFLT: p = 0.006; RT: p = 0.03) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) (RNFLT: p = 0.002; RT: p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> &gt;3.5% of BMI, ICP decreased significantly (p = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> &lt;3.5% of BMI, changes in ICP were insignificant (p = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OCT combined with visual field testing may be a valuable objective tool to monitor IIH patients and the short term IIH outcome is positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight-loss</z:hpo> is the main predictor of a favorable outcome with respect to CSF pressure </plain></SENT>
