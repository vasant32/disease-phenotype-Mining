<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the relationship between the electrocardiogram and intracranial pressure, intracranial pressure was elevated in 14 open chest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>-anesthetized dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The right vagus was stimulated to produce sinus slowing and the right atrium was paced at a constant cycle length fast enough to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and maintain heart rate constant (750 msec in 11 dogs and 600 msec in three dogs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nine dogs, intracranial pressure was sequentially elevated to 100, 150, and 200 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systolic arterial blood pressure consistently rose to exceed intracranial pressure (P less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a pressure of 150 and 200 mmHg, mean QT intervals shortened significantly in recorded leads II, X, Y, and Z from 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T wave changes were also noted that consisted of increasing positivity in leads II, X, and Y and increasing negativity in lead Z </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To delinate the role of the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, an additional five dogs were subjected to an intracranial pressure of 200 mmHg before and after bilateral stellate ganglionectomy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39465">timolol</z:chebi> (0.1 mg/kg IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elimination of sympathetic influences did not significantly alter the electrocardiographic effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> results in significant QT shortening and T wave changes that are not entirely mediated by the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
