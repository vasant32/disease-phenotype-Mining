<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transverse sinus stenosis is common in patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the role of transverse sinus stenosis in IIH pathogenesis remains controversial, modeling studies suggest that stent placement within a transverse sinus stenosis with a significant pressure gradient should decrease cerebral venous pressure, improve CSF resorption in the venous system, and thereby reduce intracranial (CSF) pressure, improving the symptoms of IIH and reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine if IIH could be reliably treated by stent placement in transverse sinus stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical, venographic, and intracranial pressure data before and after stent placement in transverse sinus stenosis in 52 of our own patients with IIH unresponsive to maximum acceptable medical treatment, treated since 2001 and followed between 2 months and 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before stent placement, the mean superior sagittal sinus pressure was 34 mm Hg (462 mm H(2)0) with a mean transverse sinus stenosis gradient of 20 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean lumbar CSF pressure before stent placement was 322 mm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 52 patients, stent placement immediately eliminated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> pressure gradient, rapidly improved IIH symptoms, and abolished <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients, symptom relapse (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>) was associated with increased venous pressure and recurrent stenosis adjacent to the previous stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these cases, placement of another stent again removed the transverse sinus stenosis pressure gradient and improved symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 52 patients, 49 have been cured of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IIH symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a role for transverse sinus stent placement in the management of selected patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
