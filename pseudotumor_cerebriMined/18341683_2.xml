<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our Neuro-Ophthalmology database (2000-2006) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 45 IIH cases, 14 (31.1%) were asymptomatic (incidental examination) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When compared with children with symptomatic IIH, asymptomatic cases were younger [5.6 (1.8-15) vs 11.0 (5-17) years, P = 0.007], had lower percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (14.3% vs 48.4%, P = 0.046), and had male predominance (71.4% vs 38.7%, P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic cases required shorter duration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> treatment [3 (0-8), vs 6 (0-20) months, P = 0.021], and resulted in complete resolution of swollen discs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that asymptomatic IIH may be more common in young children and could represent a milder form or a presymptomatic phase before evolving into classic symptomatic IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies to assess the clinical significance of asymptomatic IIH are warranted </plain></SENT>
