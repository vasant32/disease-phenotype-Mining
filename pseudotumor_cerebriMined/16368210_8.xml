<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is defined as elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure of more than 20 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF composition, and exclusion of underlying structural or systemic causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>Visual loss</z:hpo> is a serious complication, which requires careful monitoring and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 12 patients with primary PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at presentation was 8212 years, and there was a male-to-female ratio of 7:5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features of primary PTC in children, and to highlight the different treatment options in normalizing intracranial pressure in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the majority of cases, children presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients had no obvious symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> was found on routine eye examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was uncommon and there was no distinct sex predilection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> was our drug of choice for the initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">Furosemide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> were used as second-line agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment was gradually decreased after resolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> with exception of the two youngest children, who remained symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One child underwent ventricular-peritoneal shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The treatment goals of PTC are the relief of symptoms, and preservation of visual function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> is an effective first-line method of lowering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In our study group especially the young children were difficult to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This might indicate an age-related difference in the etiology of PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>When medical treatment remains ineffective and visual function deteriorates, surgical treatment should be considered </plain></SENT>
