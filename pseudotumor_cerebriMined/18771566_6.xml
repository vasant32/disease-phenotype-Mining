<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aetiology of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is not known, but its association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is well-recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have linked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> with abnormalities in circulating inflammatory and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> related cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize adipokine and inflammatory cytokine profiles in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were collected from 26 patients with IIH and compared to 62 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples were analysed for leptin, resistin, adiponectin, insulin, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 (CXCL8), TNFalpha, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 (CCL2), hepatocyte growth factor, nerve growth factor and PAI-1 using multiplex bead immunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CSF leptin was significantly higher in patients with IIH (P = 0.001) compared to controls after correction for age, gender and body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the control population, BMI correlated with serum leptin (r = 0.34; P = 0.007) and CSF leptin (r = 0.51; P &lt; 0.0001), but this was not the case for the IIH population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Profiles of other inflammatory cytokines and adipokines did not differ between IIH patients and controls once anthropometric factors had been accounted for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IIH was characterized by significantly elevated CSF leptin levels which did not correlate with BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that CSF leptin may be important in the pathophysiology of IIH and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in IIH may occur as a result of hypothalamic leptin resistance </plain></SENT>
