<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Five patients were studied with the diagnosis of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephaly</z:hpo> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338437" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurocysticercosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Valvular dysfunction was observed due to the obstruction of the ventricular catheter caused by cysticercus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Biomed System was used in four cases and the Hakim System in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Valvular dysfunction was observed in patients within a period of 18 to 24 months after derivation, they also had a history of several valvular dysfunctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made upon extraction of the catheter where the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> was found to be attached to the ventricular brush </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent evolution has not been satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reasons for this complication are of a hydrodynamic and pharmacological nature and are also due to the growth of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This complication is not often suspected, therefore we recommend that in cases of frequent valvular dysfunction and asymmetrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephaly</z:hpo>, studies like <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-tomography or magnetic resonance be carried out in order to rule out this factor </plain></SENT>
