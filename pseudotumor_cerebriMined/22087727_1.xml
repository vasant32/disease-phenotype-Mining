<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>Do they provide an insight into the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> that commonly occurs at altitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The classic theory of the pathogenesis of high altitude <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> has been that it results from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) secondary to hypoxemia in people who have less compliant intracranial volumes (Roach and Hackett, 2001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there does not appear to be a correlation between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002351" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mountain sickness</z:e> (AMS) and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> (Bailey et al, 2006; Wilson et al, 2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Research has concentrated on arterial perfusion to the brain in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, but there has been little study of venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> results in markedly increased cerebral blood flow; however, if it has been considered at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, venous outflow has to date been assumed to be of little consequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> venous distension and the increased venous blood demonstrated by near infra-red spectroscopy and more recently by MRI imply that, in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, a relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> may exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there is increasing evidence that manifestations of the fluid shift during microgravity is of similar nature to idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, which is thought to be primarily a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The unique anthropomorphic adaptations of large brained biped humans with cerebral venous systems that have to cope with large changes in hydrostatic pressure may predispose us to conditions of inflow/outflow mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, slight increases in central venous pressures (e.g., from <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction) may further compromise venous outflow at altitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of cerebral venous <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> may enlighten us with regards the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> currently considered idiopathic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may also enable us to trigger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> for study and hence enable us to develop new treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
