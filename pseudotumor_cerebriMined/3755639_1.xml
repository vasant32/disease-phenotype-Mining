<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45652">succinylcholine</z:chebi> nor atracurium increased ICP during general anaesthesia with 60 per cent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi>/O2, 0.5-1 per cent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During a rapid sequence induction and intubation with thiopentone 5 mg X kg-1 IV, ICP increased equally with intubation following both atracurium (25 +/- 1 to 32 +/- 2 mmHg) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45652">succinylcholine</z:chebi> (25 +/- 1 to 31 +/- 2 mmHg) (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intubation was also associated with significant increases in PaCO2, CVP and MAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in this primate model of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, neither atracurium nor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45652">succinylcholine</z:chebi> (when given following a defasciculating dose of curare) elevates ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In terms of the elevation of ICP associated with intubation, atracurium was found to offer no advantage over <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45652">succinylcholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
