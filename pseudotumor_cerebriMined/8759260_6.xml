<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An indirect estimate of increased CSF pressure can be obtained by the ultrasonographic determination of optic nerve sheaths diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computerised static perimetry is regarded as the method of choice for monitoring the course of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims were to compare the echographic optic nerve diameters (ONDs) and the perimetric thresholds of patients with IIH with those of age-matched controls, and to examine the correlation between these two variables in individual patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Standardised A-scan echography of the mid orbital optic nerve transverse diameters and automated threshold perimetry (Humphrey 30-2) were performed in 20 patients with IIH with variable degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> (according to the Fris√©n scheme) and no concomitant ocular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echographic and perimetric results were compared with those obtained from 20 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When compared with controls, patients with IIH showed a significant increase in mean ONDs and significantly reduced mean perimetric sensitivities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In individual patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e>, the transverse ONDs correlated negatively with Humphrey mean deviation values and positively with pattern standard deviation values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that OND changes in IIH are associated with perimetric threshold losses, and suggest that IIH functional deficits may be related to the degree of distension of optic nerve sheaths as a result of an increased CSF pressure </plain></SENT>
