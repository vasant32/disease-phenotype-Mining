<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The material includes 14 IIH patients and 7 CDH patients in whom ICP was monitored continuously over-night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Static ICP was characterized by mean ICP, pulsatile ICP was characterized by the wave amplitude, rise time, and rise time coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the IIH group <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and visual disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean ICP was high (&gt; 15 mmHg) in only 7 patients (50%), while mean ICP wave amplitude was high (≥ 4 mmHg) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> IIH patients were shunted and improved clinically thereafter (i.e., relief from visual disturbances and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None in the CDH group had high mean ICP or mean ICP wave amplitude, and none were shunted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of 14 conservatively treated IIH patients with lasting and shunt-responsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and visual disturbances, the mean ICP wave amplitude was elevated (≥ 4 mmHg) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean ICP (&lt; 15 mmHg) in 7 patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one on medication) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the pulsatile ICP may be more relevant than the static ICP in the diagnostic setting for patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further prospective standardized approaches are warranted </plain></SENT>
