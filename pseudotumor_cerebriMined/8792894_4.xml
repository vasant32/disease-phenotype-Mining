<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>Increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) is a major cause of mortality in severe head injuries and pharmacologically induced cerebral vasoconstriction has been suggested as a possible treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study a porcine model of increased ICP was utilized to study the changes in cerebral haemodynamics and energy metabolism induced by a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine1 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="10650">sumatriptan</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ICP was raised by inflation of two balloons covering both parieto-occipital regions extradurally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were randomized into four groups receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10650">sumatriptan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>0.01 mg.kg-1 (A), 0.03 mg.kg-1 (B), 0.1 mg.kg-1 (C), and 0.5 mg.kg-1 (D) intravenously over 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterio-venous oxygen content difference (CavO2), and jugular venous pH (vpH) were performed 5, 20, 40, 60, and 75 min after start of the infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICP, mean arterial pressure, and EEG were recorded continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Direct effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10650">sumatriptan</z:chebi> were also compared in cortical arteries and veins in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant decreases in ICP were obtained in groups A, B, and C while group D exhibited a progressive increase in ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions in CBF, increase in CavO2, and slowing of EEG were observed in groups B, C, and D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="10650">Sumatriptan</z:chebi> caused moderate constriction of the arteries and a more pronounced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of veins in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicate that a low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10650">sumatriptan</z:chebi> has the potential to reduce a raised ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>High doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10650">sumatriptan</z:chebi> cause a further increase of ICP possibly by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of intracerebral veins </plain></SENT>
