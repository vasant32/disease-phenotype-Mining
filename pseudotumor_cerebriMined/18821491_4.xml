<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While in the ED, the patient sustained a pulseless <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and the monitor revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postdefibrillation ECG showed a sinus rhythm (rate = 82 bpm), QRS of 236 msec, and QTc of 567 msec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> was 1.0 mEq/L (1.0 mmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was given 300 ml (300 cc) 3% <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> IV over 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten minutes after completion of the hypertonic saline infusion, the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> resolved and the QRS was 88 msec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Her <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> was repleted over the next 11 hours postpresentation, and she also received an IV bolus of 4 g of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">magnesium sulfate</z:chebi> immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, dysrhythmia, conduction delay, or ectopy was noted during the patient's hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The second case involved a 33-year-old female patient who presented 1 hour after ingesting 100 tablets of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2619">amantadine hydrochloride</z:chebi> (100 mg/tab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Initial ECG revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> with a QRS of 113 msec, an R wave in lead aVR of 4-5 mm and a QTc of 526 msec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Her serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> was 3.0 mEq/L (3.0 mmol/L), her serum calcium was 9.4 mg/dl (2.35 mmol/L), and serum <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> was 2.1 mg/dl (0.86 mmol/L) on labs drawn at initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The patient was intubated for airway protection, and her <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> was repleted and corrected over the next 9 hours </plain></SENT>
