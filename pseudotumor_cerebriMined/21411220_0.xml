<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to: (a) to assess outcomes of CSF diversion in IIH, (b) to understand influence of the type of shunt in outcomes, and (c) to understand factors predisposing in shunt failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of 34 patients who underwent cerebrospinal fluid diversion (CSFD) between 1996 and 2007 were retrieved and epidemiological and clinical data was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 35 (±7.9) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients underwent 63 shunt placements in total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>85% follow-up was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up for the entire group was 28.9 (±31.8) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headaches</z:hpo> improved more than visual disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the groups that received a VPS and those receiving an LPS in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and visual outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of complications was 20.5% and the need for revision was 35% for the whole group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with LPS suffered more complications and first time revisions than patients with VPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No factor recorded could predict the need for revision or final outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The shunts of patients receiving a VPS tend to survive longer than those receiving primarily an LPS, however the difference is not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Predicting which patients will improve is not possible at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The influence of site diversion is not critical but patients with VPS have less complications and revisions than those receiving a LPS </plain></SENT>
