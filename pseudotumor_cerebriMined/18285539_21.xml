<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Optic nerve sheath fenestration and ventricular shunting are the classic methods when medical treatment has failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is caused by venous sinus obstruction in an unknown percentage of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, endoluminal venous sinus stenting was proposed as an alternative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with refractory idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> underwent examination with direct retrograde cerebral venography and manometry to characterize the morphologic features and venous pressures in their cerebral venous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients demonstrated morphologic obstruction of the venous lateral sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CSF pressure was measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CSF pressure on lumbar puncture ranged from 27 to 45 mm Hg with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and visual acuity loss was noted in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Funduscopic examination demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had stenting of the venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intrasinus pressures were recorded before and after the procedure and correlated with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intrasinus pressures were invariably reduced by stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, six patients were rendered asymptomatic, two were improved, and two were unchanged after venous sinus stenting for a mean (+/- SD) follow-up of 17 +/- 10.1 months (range 6 to 36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> disappeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, CSF pressure was normalized at 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, direct retrograde cerebral venography or multidetector row CT angiography was performed at 6-month follow-up and demonstrated the absence of stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The importance of venous sinus disease in the etiology of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is probably underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in whom a venous sinus stenosis is demonstrated by a noninvasive radiologic workup should be evaluated with direct retrograde cerebral venography and manometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In patients with a lesion of the venous sinuses who experienced medical treatment failure, endovascular stent placement seems to be an interesting alternative to classic surgical approaches </plain></SENT>
