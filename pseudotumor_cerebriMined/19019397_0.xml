<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reducing the production rate of cerebrospinal fluid can be achieved using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23018">carbonic anhydrase inhibitors</z:chebi>), although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> is the most effective drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of steroids is debatable in BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on the pathophysiology of these medications, followed by the report of a series of 16 pediatric patients suffering from BIH (1996-2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BIH was idiopathic for eight children </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (10-20mg/kg per day) must be given every 8h to respect its kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This treatment has to be continued for at least several months and decreasing the dosage must be progressive </plain></SENT>
