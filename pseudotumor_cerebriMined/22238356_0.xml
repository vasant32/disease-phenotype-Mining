<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients fulfilling the modified Dandy's diagnostic criteria for IIH were included and their clinical features and CSF findings were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their serum samples and control groups were investigated by immunofluorescence and a cell-based assay for anti-AQP-4 antibodies and by immunohistochemistry for IgG binding patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients diagnosed with IIH were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We could not detect any anti-AQP-4 antibodies in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we identified different serum IgG binding patterns in 11 IIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is only one report investigating the anti-AQP4 antibodies in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study with a larger sample confirmed the results of this report and indicated that AQP4 antibodies did not have a primary role in IIH pathogenesis, but provided some support for the contribution of inflammatory mechanisms in IIH </plain></SENT>
