<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term success of optic nerve sheath decompression in preserving visual function in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: To define stability of visual fields, we reviewed 32 series of postoperative visual fields in patients who were undergoing optic nerve sheath decompression for PTC who had stable visual acuity and four or more fields during 6 to 60 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SD of these series was 0.80 dB (+/- 0.39 dB) of mean deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluctuations within 2 SDs of the 1-month postoperative field were +/- -1.60 dB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore defined stability as a mean deviation within 2 dB of the preoperative visual field; improvement, greater than 2-dB mean deviation, and worsening, less than 2-dB mean deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then extended our review to include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (54 patients, 75 eyes) who underwent optic nerve sheath decompression for PTC, who were followed up with serial automated perimetry (Humphrey 30-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-<z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eyes</z:mp> (68%) showed improvement (36%) or stabilization (32%) of visual function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four eyes (32%) experienced deterioration of visual function after an initially successful optic nerve sheath decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The probability of failure from 3 to 5 years was .35 by life-table analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Optic nerve sheath decompression effectively stabilizes or improves visual function in the majority of patients with PTC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it may fail at any time after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with PTC need to be followed up routinely with automated perimetry to detect deterioration of visual function </plain></SENT>
