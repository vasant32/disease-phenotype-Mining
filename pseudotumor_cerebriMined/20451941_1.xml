<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical patterns and outcome of neurological involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of patients with neurological manifestations of BD were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the International Study Group Criteria for the Diagnosis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings (neurological examination, cerebrospinal fluid, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients had clinical evidence of neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 53 men and 14 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A male/female sex ratio was 3.78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of neurological involvement was 31.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The meningoparenchymal (MP) central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement was found in 83.58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common findings were pyramidal signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (16.41%) without parenchymal central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this group, there were six cases of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> and four cases of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other clinical features were reported: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo> and isolated spinal cord involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The course of disease was favorable in 70% of cases, and unfavorable in 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical patterns of neurological involvement in BD are various and particularly serious in the MP group </plain></SENT>
