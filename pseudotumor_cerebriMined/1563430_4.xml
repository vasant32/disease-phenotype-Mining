<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT and MRI studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSUD</z:e> are few and the data are overlapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study reports CT features before and after dietary treatment in three patients; two with classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSUD</z:e> and one with an intermediate variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSUD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, CT consistently showed evidence of abnormally high lucidity involving not only white matter, but also areas of grey matter, particularly the pallidum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these CT changes are present both in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSUD</z:e> and in an intermediate variant of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observed abnormalities evolve favorably under dietary treatment, simultaneously with clinical and neurological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the observed CT changes indicate a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSUD</z:e> and are relevant findings in the neuroradiologic differential diagnosis in acutely ill newborns, in which a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e> may be not immediately suspected </plain></SENT>
