<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although they can provide a rapid and effective resolution of the symptoms there are major disadvantages associated with their use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 21 patients who underwent LP shunt insertion in our institution during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Eighteen patients (85.7%) underwent at least one shunt revision with a total of 63 revisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shunt related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were observed in 7 cases and 7 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo>, 2 (9%) of these requiring further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the symptomatic control achieved with lumboperitoneal shunts we find the complication and revision rates unacceptably high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technique should be re-evaluated and other treatment strategies considered </plain></SENT>
