<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the hypothesis that idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is associated with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo>, using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Values for the mean diffusivity of water (&lt;D&gt;) and the proton longitudinal relaxation time (T1) were measured for various brain regions in 10 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 10 age, sex, and weight matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences in &lt;D&gt; and T1 values were found between patient and control groups in any of the brain regions investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is not associated with abnormalities of convective transependymal water flow leading to diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
