<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The author outlines the history of the development of the pseudotumor concept, first specifically formulated by Nonne in 1904 but implicit in earlier descriptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A scheme of periodization is applied, identifying otological, neurosurgical, neurological, and neuroophthalmological periods; he relates theoretical and practical developments in the understanding of the condition to the concerns of the dominant speciality involved in diagnosis and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Key studies from each period are discussed in relation to the issues of mechanism, origin, nomenclature, diagnosis, and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the otological period, approaches to the condition were heavily influenced by its common association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle ear infection</z:e>, often with venous sinus involvement, and this led to the idea of disturbed cerebrospinal fluid dynamics as the cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>The advent of neuroradiological systems ushered in the neurosurgical period in which the significant but unfinished debate began: which intracranial compartment is primarily implicated in the intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By the time of the neurological period <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> was implicated as the cause, and this coincided with the availability of appropriate treatment methods and steroidal and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Toward the end of this period additional major advances in investigative methods again brought the issue of mechanism into contention, although a resolution was not to follow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroophthalmological period is characterized by an increased awareness of the significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and a return to one of the original methods of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the possible significance of impaired cranial venous outflow, a thread running through <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> periods, is considered </plain></SENT>
