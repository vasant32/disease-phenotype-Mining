<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (14 eyes) were treated who had pseudotumor with optic nerve sheath fenestration, in whom automated perimetry was used as a major parameter in the decision to undertake surgery and in evaluating the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Visual field results demonstrated significant improvement in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven of 8 eyes with total loss less than 1500 dB had improvement or no further deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using results of the last preoperative examination as baseline, it was found that six of the eight had improvement over 150 dB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient, a slight deterioration occurred postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those eyes with total loss above 1500 dB demonstrated stabilization of fields postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis of total loss preoperatively and postoperatively for this group of patients demonstrated significant improvement for five of the six comparisons investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average preoperative total loss and average postoperative total loss were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of results of the last preoperative examination to those of the first postoperative and most recent follow-up examinations, and evaluation of average total loss postoperatively showed significant improvement had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results of the first postoperative examination and those of the most recent follow-up examination showed significant improvement from the average preoperative total loss </plain></SENT>
