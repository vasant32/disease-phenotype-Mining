<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The body mass index was 40 kg/m(2) or greater (extremely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>) in two men, 30 to 40 kg/m(2) (<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>) in three, and was 25 to 30 kg/m(2) in five (overweight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases differed from controls for inherited 4G4G homozygosity of the PAI-1 gene, four of 10 (40%) vs. one of 20 (5%), Fisher's p [p(f)]= .031, and for high levels (&gt;21.1 U/mL) of the hypofibrinolytic PAI-1 gene product, PAI-Fx, 5 of 10 (50%) vs. one of 18 (6%), p(f) = .013 </plain></SENT>
