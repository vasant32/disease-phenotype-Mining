<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the utility of the tympanic membrane displacement (TMD) analyser for non-invasive measurement of ICP in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We made TMD observations on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and acutely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> children presenting to Kilifi District Hospital (KDH) at the rural coast of Kenya and on children on follow-up for idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> at Evelina Children's Hospital (ECH), in London, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We recruited 63 patients (median age 3.3 (inter-quartile range (IQR) 2.0-4.3) years) at KDH and 14 children (median age 10 (IQR 5-11) years) at ECH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed significantly higher (more negative) TMD measurements in KDH children presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children seen at the hospital's outpatient department, in both semi-recumbent [mean -61.3 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) -93.5 to 29.1) nl versus mean -7.1 (95 % CI -54.0 to 68.3) nl, respectively; P = 0.03] and recumbent postures [mean -61.4 (95 % CI -93.4 to -29.3) nl, n = 59) versus mean -25.9 (95 % CI -71.4 to 123.2) nl, respectively; P = 0.03] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observed higher TMD measurements in ECH children with raised ICP measurements, as indicated by lumbar puncture manometry, compared to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ICP, in both semi-recumbent [mean -259.3 (95 % CI -363.8 to -154.8) nl versus mean 26.7 (95 % CI -52.3 to 105.7) nl, respectively; P &lt; 0.01] and recumbent postures [mean -137.5 (95 % CI -260.6 to -14.4) nl versus mean 96.6 (95 % CI 6.5 to 186.6) nl, respectively; P &lt; 0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The TMD analyser has a potential utility in monitoring ICP in a variety of clinical circumstances </plain></SENT>
