<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) were examined in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To validate the assay it was shown that CSF which had been run over a somatostatin immunoaffinity column showed no interference with binding of synthetic standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reversed phase HPLC showed that the immunoreactive material coeluted with SS14 and SS28 as well as a higher molecular weight precursor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of human CSF SLI were stable at both room temperature and 4 degrees C for up to 72 h while repeated freezing and thawing resulted in a significant loss of immunoreactive material after the 3rd repetition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control patients less than 55 years of age, CSF SLI was 54.7 +/- 1.9 pg/ml, while in those older than 55 CSF SLI was 56.2 +/- 2.2 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Febrile infants had significantly higher levels (75.4 +/- 7.3) pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSF SLI was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in patients with aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (54.4 +/- 3.4 pg/ml), suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002922'>increased CSF protein</z:hpo> and white cell counts do not affect concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of CSF SLI were significantly increased in intervertebral disc disease (65.1 +/- 5.6 pg/ml), intrinsic spinal cord pathology (101.0 +/- 23.9 pg/ml), central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (78.0 +/- 7.8 pg/ml) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cortical damage of varied etiology (277.8 +/- 81.6 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> had concentrations of 43.2 +/- 2.5 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of CSF SLI were significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) in multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (38.8 +/- 5.5 pg/ml) and old cortical pathology (23.2 +/- 3.9 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serial CSF analysis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> lesions, suggest that CSF SLI may be a neurochemical marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pathology, as the initially elevated levels fell to or below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with resolution of the pathologic process </plain></SENT>
