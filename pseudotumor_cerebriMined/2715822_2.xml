<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-one rats in neurogenic shock (defined as a mean systemic arterial pressure (SAP) of less than 60 mm Hg) were subjected to various treatments to increase the mean SAP to a level of more than 80 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group with neurogenic shock received no treatment, and the six treatment groups received infusions of: whole blood, packed cells, plasma, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>, or a combination of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detrimental effects were observed after transfusion of packed cells or whole blood, which caused further deterioration of mean SAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> or the combination of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and saline were both effective (p = 0.0001) for reversing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, the combination was the most effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If this rat paradigm correlates with human disease, these results indicate that, in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo>, neurogenic shock due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> should be treated with a combined transfusion of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline, but not blood since the latter could have a detrimental effect </plain></SENT>
