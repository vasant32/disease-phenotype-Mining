<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients from a consecutive series of 41 patients with benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) were treated by cerebrospinal fluid shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients this was selected as the primary treatment due to the severe deterioration of vision or concern regarding the possible adverse effects of steroids; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 patients showed rapid and complete resolution of the disease, although eight patients still have a shunt in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 24 patients a shunt was inserted when other forms of treatment failed; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients showed rapid resolution of the condition, although 20 patients still have a shunt in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had the shunt removed without sequelae, and one patient in whom the shunt was removed because of low-pressure symptoms remains symptomatic with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (over 6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percutaneous lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt was associated with the lowest revision and complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cisternal shunting to either the atrium or pleural cavity was next most effective, whereas valved LP shunts inserted via a laminectomy were least effective; ventricular shunts were used in only two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Shunting is therefore very effective in the treatment of BIH, but the significant complication rate and the possibility of inducing shunt dependence must be recognized </plain></SENT>
