<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Objective: This study is designed to describe the association between benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) and spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea and address the effect of extracranial venous flow dynamics on intracranial pressure (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: We present a 58-year-old woman with refractory spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea who was later found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038833" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superior vena cava syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient had undergone two prior transnasal endoscopic repair attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In retrospect, a preoperative magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) suggested very prolonged cerebral transit time, despite otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: The CSF leak was repaired through a bifrontal craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intraoperative and postoperative course was complicated due to the patient's significant comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She ultimately made a good recovery and has not had any further CSF rhinorrhea in more than 2 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Refractory, spontaneous CSF leak must prompt aggressive investigation for multiple causes of elevated ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A cerebral transit time can be obtained from scout imaging when a magnetic resonance angiogram or MRV is performed, and this may disclose elevated ICP if it is prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If endoscopic transnasal repair fails, craniotomy and direct suture repair and autologous tissue reinforcement of the skull base may prove successful and durable, even if BIH persists </plain></SENT>
