<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Alagille syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGS</z:e>) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0559758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multisystem disorder</z:e> defined by developmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001392'>abnormalities of the liver</z:hpo>, heart, eye and skeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although visual problems are recognised, the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and its link with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To review the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and IIH in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGS</z:e> managed at a National Paediatric Liver Unit between 1989 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Retrospective case note review of children who fulfilled criteria for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGS</z:e> and had an ophthalmic examination by a paediatric ophthalmologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGS</z:e> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 41 children fulfilled diagnostic criteria and had a documented ophthalmic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six children had undergone liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three children had a definite diagnosis of IIH, 2 of whom developed postliver transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 were treated medically, but 1 child with IIH required lumboperitoneal shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 children with definite IIH have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vision after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Another child with probable undiagnosed IIH has bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> and is registered blind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGS</z:e> are registered partially sighted, one with rod cone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> and the other with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000580'>pigmentary retinopathy</z:hpo> and right disc <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Although visual abnormalities are well described in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGS</z:e>, a minority of children have significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000529'>progressive visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> has been identified as a potentially treatable precipitating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We recommend annual fundoscopy in the follow-up of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGS</z:e> to facilitate early detection and appropriate management of IIH to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
