<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new technique is described that utilises a novel magnetic resonance pulse sequence to produce a quantitative index both for ventricular and, for the first time, extraventricular intracranial CSF volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pulse sequence is a combination of a null-point inversion recovery sequence with an extended spin-echo read (echo time = 400 ms), which produces a contrast of CSF to white or grey matter of approximately 120:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A series of experiments are performed on phantoms representing CSF filled ventricles and sulci over a wide range of volume values, and it is found that the standard deviation of differences between true and estimated values is 3.9% for ventricles, 4.6% for total cranial CSF, and 7.9% for CSF within the sulci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> volunteer reproducibility studies revealed corresponding standard deviations of less than 5.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the technique to produce absolute estimates of CSF volumes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and patients produced results in good agreement with previously published necropsy studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technique has wide neurological and neurosurgical applicability particularly in terms of differential diagnosis and as an objective monitor of therapy or progression in conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
