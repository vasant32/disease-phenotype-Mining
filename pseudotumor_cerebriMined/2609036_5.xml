<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were conscious, and sleep stages including REM sleep were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During non-REM sleep, ICP significantly rose in Stage II on many occasions, and was always lower in Stage IV than in other sleep stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A marked elevation of ICP was seen in REM sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICP changes during REM sleep were characterized by frequent appearances of the pressure waves; 88.9% of A-waves and 95.1% of episodic B-waves appeared during REM sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initiation of REM sleep scored on EEG began 1 to 2 minutes prior to or at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the episodic pressure waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The episodic pressure waves are assumed to be induced by the intracranial conditions in REM sleep, when increased brain activity and reduced sympathetic tone are known to occur simultaneously </plain></SENT>
