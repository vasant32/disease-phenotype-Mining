<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> can change the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of anatomical structures that are critical in the evaluation of pseudotumor syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to establish the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of such markers of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and to consider a dependency on sex, age and body-mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 123 persons without signs or symptoms of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (63 females, 60 males, 18- 86-years-old, mean 49.5 SD17.8 years, mean BMI 25.3 SD42) were prospectively enrolled and MRI was performed at 3T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A STIR sequence in the coronal plane was used to measure the width of the optic nerve, the perioptic fluid rim and the total optic nerve sheath diameter in 4 different locations behind the eyeball </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The height and width of the pituitary and Meckel's cave were also measured and the area was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean width of the optic nerve sheath narrows significantly from anterior (mean 5.3 SD 0.6 mm) to posterior (mean 4.1 SD 0.4 mm), as does the perioptic fluid rim (mean 1.4 SD 0.3 mm vs. mean 1.0 SD 0.2 mm) and--to a lesser extent--the optic nerve itself (mean 2.4 SD 0.4 mm vs. mean 2 SD 0.3 mm, p=0.000 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically relevant correlation of the width of the optic nerve sheath with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The coronal area of Meckel's cave was independent of sex, age or BMI (mean 39 SD 9.3 mm2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The height of the pituitary differed little in women (mean 4.4 SD 0.9 mm) and men (mean 4.2 SD 0.8 mm), but we found a significant negative correlation with age in women only (r = -0.38, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presented typical values and their deviations serve as a basis for the evaluation of pathologies in patients suspected of having pseudotumor syndrome </plain></SENT>
