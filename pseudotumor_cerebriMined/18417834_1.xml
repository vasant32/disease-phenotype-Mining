<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present here a case report where a young lady presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC), where medical treatment for PTC failed and the presence of cysticercous in spinal canal was detected only on the operation table, while doing a lumbo-peritoneal shunt (LP shunt) to save her vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis could be confirmed only after the histopathology report was received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She did not have any direct evidence of spinal involvement, thereby eluding correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In English literature, we could not find any report of isolated and silent spinal NCC associated with PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we could not find any report of recovery of cysticercous larva through the Touhey's needle injury, although this was an incidental finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In endemic areas, isolated spinal NCC should be suspected in patients presenting with PTC </plain></SENT>
