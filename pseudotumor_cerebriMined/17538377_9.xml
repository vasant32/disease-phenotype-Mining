<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent reports have shown promising short- to medium-term results in patients with refractory idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) treated using the stereotactic ventriculoperitoneal shunting (SVPS) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the long-term clinical efficacy of this technique remains questionable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report provides the long-term results of SVPS in treating refractory IIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical charts of nine consecutive patients (mean age, 26.4 yr; range, 4-63 yr) treated using either a frame-based or frameless SVPS technique for IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean postoperative follow-up period was 44.3 months (range, 6-110 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before shunting procedures were performed, each patient presented with intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and five patients (55.6%) had mild to moderate visual deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The last follow-up assessment showed that after shunting was performed, eight patients (89%) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>; however, this patient's pain was much less frequent and severe than before the shunting procedure was completed and was concomitant with recent weight increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Visual deficits were resolved in three patients and remained stable in two who already had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic nerve atrophy</z:hpo> before shunting was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve SVPS procedures were performed on our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine shunt revisions were needed in six patients because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n = 5, including two revisions in one patient), valve dysfunction (n = 2), distal obstruction (n = 1), and ventricular catheter malpositioning (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient had proximal catheter obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Given the favorable long-term outcome of the SVPS technique for refractory IIH, we are encouraged to apply this procedure on our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More invasive approaches should be reserved for patients who have SVPS failure </plain></SENT>
