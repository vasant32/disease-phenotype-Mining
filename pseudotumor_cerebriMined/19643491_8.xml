<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify and describe patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) with concurrent functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> (FVL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational, retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen patients with IIH and FVL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical features were collected retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data from 281 cases of IIH were analyzed for concurrence of FVL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Occurrence of FVL diagnosed at presentation or on subsequent follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients had FVL and IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 patients with FVL and IIH, 11 (65%) had FVL on presentation, with the remaining 6 patients developing FVL after initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients in this cohort had documented recurrence of their IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were several common patterns of FVL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 17 patients had functional visual fields, with 82% having tubular fields and 71% exhibiting nonphysiologic constriction on perimetry testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six percent of patients had nerve/field mismatch showing no atrophic disc changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight percent of patients had significant psychiatric, psychosocial, or other medical comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients were managed surgically at some point in their clinical history, with 53% having nerve decompression, shunt, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three patients had optic nerve sheath fenestrations after the diagnosis of FVL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest a high prevalence of FVL in IIH with a potential association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric illness</z:e> and psychosocial stressors requiring careful consideration before surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
