<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end, a retrospective chart review was conducted on 21 neurosurgical trauma patients with uncontrolled intracranial pressure (ICP) admitted to a trauma/intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this patient population, the overall mortality was 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control of ICP was achieved in 67% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survival of patients experiencing ICP control with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> was better than those patients who failed therapy (71% vs 14%, p = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, in a subgroup of neurosurgical trauma patients who are refractory to conventional management of elevated ICP, <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> appear to improve survival, suggesting that this therapy has an important role in the management of neurotrauma patients </plain></SENT>
