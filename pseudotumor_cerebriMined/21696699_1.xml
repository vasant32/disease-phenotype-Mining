<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To provide an update on various features of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Selected articles on the epidemiology, clinical and imaging features, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were reviewed and interpreted in the context of the authors' clinical and research experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> primarily is a disease of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women of childbearing age, but it can affect patients of any weight, sex, and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although a relatively <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e>, idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>'s associated costs in the United States entail hundreds of millions of dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even after treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> frequently are persistent and may require the continued involvement of a neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quality-of-life reductions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> are common among idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visual dysfunction</z:e>, especially visual field abnormalities, represents the major morbidity of this disorder, and serial automated perimetry remains the primary method of patient monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who are men, black, very <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, or anemic are at higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vitamin A metabolism, adipose tissue as an actively secreting <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> tissue, and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002624'>venous abnormalities</z:hpo> are areas of active study regarding the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment studies show that lumbar puncture is a valuable treatment (in addition to its crucial diagnostic role), and that weight management is critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, open questions remain regarding the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures, and cerebral venous stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many questions remain unanswered about idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ongoing studies, especially an ongoing National Institutes of Health-funded clinical trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, should provide more insight into this important, yet poorly understood, syndrome of isolated intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
