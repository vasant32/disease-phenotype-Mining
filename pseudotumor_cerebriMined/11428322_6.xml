<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-note review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, diagnosed at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast between 1991 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-two patients were identified corresponding to an average annual incidence rate per 100,000 persons of 0.5 for the total and 0.9 for the female population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The commonest presenting symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (84%), transient visual obscurations (61%) and sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Impaired Snellen visual acuity and visual field loss were documented in 21% and 62% of patients respectively at presentation, and in 24% and 39% at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient suffered deterioration in visual functioning sufficient to interfere with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> daily activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The age and sex specific incidence rates of IIH in Northern Ireland are lower than have been reported in previous population-based series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> occurs in a small number of patients despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> interventions </plain></SENT>
