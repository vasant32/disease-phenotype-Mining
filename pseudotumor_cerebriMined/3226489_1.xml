<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first case was a 68-year-old man admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> for eight days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no history of head trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A CT scan revealed a high-density mass that had a concave inner margin in the left temporo-parietal region with a slight midline shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No vascular lesion was noted on the angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The consciousness of the patient deteriorated suddenly on the 12th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An operation was performed because of a marked midline shift on the CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At operation, a subdural clot was removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The postoperative recovery was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged 7 days later without any neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The second case was a 69-year-old man who was admitted with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no history of head trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A CT scan showed a high density mass in the right temporoparietal subdural space with a slight midline shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The consciousness of the patient deteriorated suddenly on the 15th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An operation was performed because of a marked midline shift on the CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At operation, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> was removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two days later, suddenly his consciousness deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A CT scan showed his severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> with a marked midline shift without increased <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>External decompression was performed immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The postoperative recovery was very good and 40 days after the second operation, the patient was discharged with no neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The delayed intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> appeared in these two cases about 10 days after the initial symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Two kinds of mechanisms are suspected: 1) swelling of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> because of the adsorption of cerebrospinal fluid, 2) the occurrence of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>From our experience, a repeated CT scan is necessary for 2 to 3 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
