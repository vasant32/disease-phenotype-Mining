<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We measured the intracranial pressure continuously for a period of four days before and after cranioplasty in 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001362'>skull defects</z:hpo> larger than 100 cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were obtained by epidural monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The device used was the "Hellige" pressure measuring device (modified according to Gobiet) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found an increased cranial pressure in more than half of the patients (7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition the same patients showed the most marked neurologic and psychic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> of the intracranial pressure was noticed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients after the closure of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001362'>skull defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progressive improvement in the clinical symptoms was also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of this phenomenon has not been completely explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several authors consider that an important factor is the difference between the intracranial and the atmospheric pressure, However, we suggest that another important factor is the cicatricial changes ("scar plate") occurring between the cortex, dura and the skin, which exerts pressure on the skull contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Previously, the neurological symptoms which appeared after a period of time in patients with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0001362'>skull defects</z:hpo> were attributed to other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is only during the past decades--thanks to progress in neuroradiologic diagnostics--that a pathoanatomical correlate been found for these changes </plain></SENT>
