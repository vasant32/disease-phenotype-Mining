<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether inferior tonsillar displacement (ITD) is coincidental or linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify the prevalence of both CM and cerebellar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> (CE) (ITD below the foramen magnum &gt; or = 5 mm and 2-4 mm, respectively) in PTC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review combined with prospective assessment of 68 PTC patients with available brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data collected included patient demographics, height, weight, co-morbid conditions, and medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRIs were analyzed for cerebellar tonsillar position, and results were compared with original reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 68 PTC patients, 60 (88%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> position of the cerebellar tonsils and 8 (12%) had ITD by report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the latter group, 4 were identified as CM and 4 as CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On review of MRIs, however, 16 patients (24%) had ITD, 7 having CM and 9 having CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with ITD were female, most were overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and most had presumed idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ITD exists pre-surgically in a significant percentage of PTC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ITD is most common in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> or overweight women with presumed IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In fact, this subset of patients may actually represent a secondary form of PTC and may benefit from correction of ITD to restore <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
