<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 9 of the 16 patients the disorder became evident after the application of an exogenous volume-pressure testing procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This procedure enabled a classification into a group I--disturbed CSF circulation (8 patients)--and another group II--<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF circulation (8 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During a routine <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-CT-CBF study <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients of both groups were given to 1 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (DIAMOX) intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before, during and after the administration of DIAMOX the epidural ICP was continuously measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increase in ICP was monitored in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group I the average initial ICP was 13.6 +/- 7.6 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximum ICP was reached within a time interval of 13.1 +/- 4.5 min after DIAMOX administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At this time the mean ICP was 36.4 +/- 19.2 mmHg (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average initial ICP in group II was 6.3 +/- 4.2 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The maximum ICP was reached within a time interval of 13.6 +/- 1.1 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At this time the mean ICP was 11.9 +/- 4.8 mmHg (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In respect to the maximum ICP both groups were significantly different (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite a considerably rising ICP up to values of about 50 to 70 mmHg in several patients of group I only 1 patient complained of being sick </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Presumingly, an ICP elevation caused by vasodilatation would be better tolerated than ICP elevations due to other causes </plain></SENT>
