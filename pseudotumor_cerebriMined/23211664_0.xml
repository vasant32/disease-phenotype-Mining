<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage may occur in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe herein spontaneous CSF leakage as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> increased ICP in 4 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although rhinorrhea previously has been described in IIH patients, to our knowledge this is the first report of otorrhea in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Four patients with spontaneous CSF leakage were examined between 2001 and 2011; 3 presented with rhinorrhea and 1 with otorrhea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical settings and manifestations were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were found to have IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three had been diagnosed with IIH several years earlier and had been noncompliant with their medical treatment, whereas in 1 patient, CSF rhinorrhea was the presenting symptom of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: CSF leak is a rare complication in IIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have shown that rhinorrhea can be the presenting sign in these patients and that rhinorrhea and otorrhea can be a late sign of the disease </plain></SENT>
