<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The protein concentration and the specific gravity of each sample were measured and the corresponding mean absorption numbers were calculated from the numerical printout of the preoperative computerized tomogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For fluids with a specific gravity greater than 1.005, a linear relationship was demonstrated between protein concentration and specific gravity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For protein concentrations greater than 300 mg/dl, there was a linear relationship between protein concentration and the mean absorption number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the precision of present instrumentation improves, it is expected that a noninvasive technique for estimating intracranial protein concentration will have a number of clinical application </plain></SENT>
