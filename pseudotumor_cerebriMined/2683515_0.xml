<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two series, amounting 68 patients altogether, collected in epidemiologically homogeneous areas with high percentage of rural population without adequate medical control, are appraised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lesions, particularly in the pre-CT scan era (1968-1975), radical excision was required in 70.6% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall postoperative mortality was 14.7%: 7.3% during the hospital stay, mostly due to pyrogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302598" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ventriculitis</z:e> in patients with large deep located abscesses, and 7.4% for different complications, both intra- and extracerebral, at home or other institutions several months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>29% of patients recovered completely and 45.6% have only minor disability, only 10.3% remained severely crippled and dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the surgery, both in terms of operative mortality and functional recovery seem to depend on the neuropathological background rather than on the kind of therapeutic procedure implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even though it must be acknowledged that at present conservative and minor surgical procedures are more often successfully used, radical excision still appears to keep far from negligible indications </plain></SENT>
