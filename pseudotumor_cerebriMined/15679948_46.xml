<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The parenchyma of the brain does not contain lymphatics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it has been assumed that arachnoid projections into the cranial venous system are responsible for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, recent quantitative and qualitative evidence in sheep suggest that nasal lymphatics have the major role in CSF transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the applicability of this concept to other species, especially to humans has never been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the CSF and nasal lymph associations in human and non-human primates with those observed in other mammalian species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies were performed in sheep, pigs, rabbits, rats, mice, monkeys and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediately after sacrifice (or up to 7 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in humans), yellow Microfil was injected into the CSF compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The heads were cut in a sagittal plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the seven species examined, Microfil was observed primarily in the subarachnoid space around the olfactory bulbs and cribriform plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The contrast agent followed the olfactory nerves and entered extensive lymphatic networks in the submucosa associated with the olfactory and respiratory epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first direct evidence of the association between the CSF and nasal lymph compartments in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The fact that the pattern of Microfil distribution was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> species tested, suggested that CSF absorption into nasal lymphatics is a characteristic feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mammals including humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is tempting to speculate that some disorders of the CSF system (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> for example) may relate either directly or indirectly to a lymphatic CSF absorption deficit </plain></SENT>
