<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The knowledge of intracranial pressure (ICP) is the basis of an appropriate neurosurgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because clinical, fundoscopic, or radiological data alone are often elusive, a pre- or postoperative long-term monitoring of the ICP itself is desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We describe the first clinical experiences with a new telemetric ICP-monitoring device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The transducer of this telemetric intraparenchymal pressure probe is placed under the galea over the calvaria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICP can be monitored via a special telemetric reader, placed over the intact skin, and the ICP values are stored in a small portable computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The system does not require an intensive care environment and can be used in any ward or even at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The system was successfully applied in 10 patients (age, 3-56 years) in whom raised ICP due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, shunt dysfunction, endoscopic third ventriculostomy failure, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Continuous telemetric monitoring of ICP was performed for 2 to 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 7 patients, increased ICP values could be excluded, and further surgical maneuvers were avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, repeated plateaus or continuously raised ICP indicated surgery resulting in a normalization of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This new telemetric system was safe and effective for ICP measurement over a long period, including home monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the patients, it was easy to handle, and reliable data could be recorded over many weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on this preliminary experience, the authors consider the new system extremely advantageous in surgical decision making in particularly difficult cases of suspected abnormalities of ICP </plain></SENT>
