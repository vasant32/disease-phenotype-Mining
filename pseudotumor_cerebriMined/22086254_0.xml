<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nonrandomized controlled trial analyzing the difference in cerebral perfusion in 13 IIH patients and 12 healthy controls using contrast-enhanced duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients, an additional 3D gradient echo magnetic resonance venography (MRV) using a new technique was performed to quantify stenosis of the cerebral sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cerebral perfusion parameters, including cerebral transit time (CTT) and time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IIH patients had a higher BMI (29.3 [95% CI 26.4, 32.2] vs. 23.3 [95% CI 20.7, 25.9], p = 0.003) and an increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other clinical characteristics were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CTT did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was significantly longer in IIH patients compared to controls (8.5 [95% CI 7.6, 9.4] vs. 7.3 s [95% CI 6.3, 8.1], p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 13 (92%) IIH patients showed stenosis of the cerebral sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to report an altered cerebral venous flow in IIH patients compared to controls using a dynamic ultrasonographic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A simplified MRV technique confirms the high prevalence and reliable detection of venous stenosis in IIH patients </plain></SENT>
