<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> may alleviate symptoms of IIH yet may be difficult to achieve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin, a gastric hormone, is involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body weight and appetite regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its levels are elevated in syndromes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001433'>overeating</z:mp> and decline in simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We postulated that fasting plasma ghrelin levels are elevated in IIH patients and that the typical postprandial decline in plasma ghrelin may not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, observational case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital and clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>STUDY POPULATION: Sixty-five patients with a diagnosis of IIH and 25 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> control patients (screened for IIH symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with intracranial abnormalities or a history of gastric surgery were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATION PROCEDURE: Fasting plasma ghrelin, leptin, and insulin levels were assessed between 8 am and 10 am </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subjects were fed a standard breakfast, and postprandial ghrelin levels were measured 30 minutes later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasting plasma ghrelin levels negatively correlated with body mass index in both IIH subjects (r = -.48) and controls; leptin showed a positive correlation with body mass index in both IIH (r =.59) and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Levels were not significantly different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Postprandial ghrelin declined by 71 +/- 31 (95% CI) pg/ml in the IIH group and 71 +/- 35 (95% CI) pg/ml in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plasma ghrelin levels, both fasting and postprandial, do not differ between IIH patients and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> IIH patients should be encouraged to lose weight and referred for medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> management to maximize their chances of alleviating their symptoms </plain></SENT>
