<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In neurosurgical patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, dialysis entails specific problems, chief of which is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> as a result of rapid lowering of the serum osmolality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Another major problem is a tendency to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, in response to either systemic heparinization or insufficient dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors describe the results obtained with hemodialysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH), continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD), and intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, one with CAVH, five with CAPD or CPD, and two with IPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the six patients treated with continuous dialysis (CAVH, CAPD, and CPD) died, whereas intermittent dialysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and IPD) carried an 82% mortality rate (nine of 11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in three cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in three, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> in three, overhydration due to insufficient dialysis in one, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> in one, and rupture of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continuous dialysis appeared to be superior to intermittent dialysis in these neurosurgical patients in that it produced less <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and was less often associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to insufficient dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and CAVH, systemic heparinization was also thought to account for the high incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, CAVH with short half-life <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> may be useful in patients who have abdominal complications and are therefore not suitable candidates for peritoneal dialysis </plain></SENT>
