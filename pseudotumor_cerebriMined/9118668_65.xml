<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of acutely increased intra-abdominal pressure on pleural pressure, intracranial pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure, and to clarify the relationship between these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Nonrandomized, controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Laboratory at a university medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Yorkshire swine, weighing 15 to 20 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Anesthetized, ventilated swine had a balloon inserted into the peritoneal cavity and catheters placed for measurement of intracranial pressure, pleural pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> pressure, and mean arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following baseline measurements, intra-abdominal pressure was increased by incrementally inflating the intraperitoneal balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> parameters were remeasured 30 mins after each increase in intra-abdominal pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two groups were studied: a) group 1 (n = 9) animals had intra-abdominal pressure increased to 25 mm Hg above baseline, then released; b) group 2 (n = 3) animals underwent sternotomy and pleuropericardotomy to prevent an increase in pleural pressure with increasing intra-abdominal pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Increase of intra-abdominal pressure to 25 mm Hg above baseline caused significant (p &lt; .05) increases in intracranial pressure (7.3 +/- 0.6 [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>] to 16.4 +/- 1.9 mm Hg), pleural pressure (4.3 +/- 1.3 to 11.8 +/- 1.9 mm Hg), pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> pressure (9.0 +/- 0.6 to 14.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg), and central venous pressure (6.6 +/- 0.7 to 10.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cardiac index (3.4 +/- 0.3 to 1.6 +/- 0.1 L/min/m2) and cerebral perfusion pressure (75.6 +/- 3.6 to 62.0 +/- 6.8 mm Hg) deceased significantly (p &lt; .05), whereas mean arterial pressure (82.8 +/- 3.2 to 78.4 +/- 6.6 mm Hg) remained essentially constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sternotomy and pleuro-pericardotomy negated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure except the decreased cardiac index (1.6 +/- 0.1 to 2.5 +/- 0.2 L/min/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Acutely increased intra-abdominal pressure causes a significant increase in intracranial pressure and a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased intra-abdominal pressure appears to produce this effect by augmenting pleural and other intrathoracic pressures and causing a functional obstruction to cerebral venous outflow via the jugular venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the same phenomenon may be why persons with chronically increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as the morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, suffer from a high frequency rate of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
