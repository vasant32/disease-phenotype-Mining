<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was remarkable as the only disease among many studied that showed such a discrepancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A further study was done, now prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Log IgG index values were elevated in 2 of the 11 new cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As before, qualitative measurement (isoelectric focusing) gave uniformly negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the 6 instances where the log IgG index was elevated could be accounted for, in fact, by abnormal values of constituent variables other than cerebrospinal fluid IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative tests for intrathecal synthesis of IgG can give misleading results on their own </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunological mechanisms most probably are not involved in the pathogenesis of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
