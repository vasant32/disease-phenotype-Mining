<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> and intact regulation, positive pressure inhalation appears to briefly occlude venous flow into the cranial sinuses during inspiration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result, the intracranial pressure and arterial pressure signals are not similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when maximal dilation causes failure of regulation of cerebral blood flow, the intracranial pressure signal is approximately proportional to the arterial pressure signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the cross-correlation function derived from the intracranial and arterial pressure signals to the autocorrelation function of the arterial signal reveals that the two correlation functions are: 1) different during intact regulation and 2) nearly identical during dilation induced failure of regulation of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
