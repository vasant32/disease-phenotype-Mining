<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Since idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is most prevalent in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women of childbearing age, concerns arise regarding the impact of pregnancy on the disorder and the potential teratogenicity of some therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the course, management of pregnant IIH patients and the visual and pregnancy outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case series of pregnant women diagnosed with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IIH symptoms, neuro-ophthalmological findings, IIH management, visual and pregnancy outcomes were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 240 women with IIH, 12 had 16 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, five had transient visual obscurations, and three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity was severely decreased in one and mildly reduced in three women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six had marked and six had mild bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Visual field loss occurred in four women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visual symptoms and loss improved for the duration of the pregnancy after diagnostic lumbar puncture and salt restricted diet in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two additional women needed continuous spinal drainage for two days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One woman was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and medical abortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The one woman with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> had fenestration of one optic nerve sheath and a lumboperitoneal shunt as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and was the only case with permanent field loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After intervention, visual acuity improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with reduced vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were 10 full-term <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> deliveries, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">missed abortions</z:e>, one therapeutic abortion and two intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IIH appears to present during the first two trimesters of pregnancy with typical symptoms and findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Visual outcome is similar as for non-pregnant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Treatment should be oriented towards dietary control, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Repeated spinal fluid drainage, if needed, can be helpful </plain></SENT>
