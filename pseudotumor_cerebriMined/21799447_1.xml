<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is a rare condition that can lead to significant morbidity from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cause of IIH is unknown, but IIH is known to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> patients may be at particularly high risk for suffering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> from IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study is to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed or asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in a population of morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals and to determine if these patients should undergo routine screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients presenting to the UC Davis Bariatric Surgery Clinic between February 2008 and January 2011 who met the National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric surgery were invited to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those patients who met the inclusion criteria and consented to the study were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants were screened for IIH by nonmydriatic fundus photographs and by concerning symptoms prompting direct referral for neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Images were reviewed by a neuro-ophthalmologist, and patients with suspicious optic discs underwent neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with findings consistent with IIH were sent for neurological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 606 patients with an average body mass index of 47 kg/m2 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of these patients had photographic optic disc findings or symptoms suspicious for IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven of these patients did not have disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> on clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six patients were not evaluated in the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four of the 17 patients had subtle optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> confirmed by clinical evaluation and were referred for full neurological workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These 4 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuroimaging, 3 of whom underwent lumbar punctures with borderline high opening pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 patients had unremarkable visual field examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Fundus abnormalities other than optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were discovered in 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that in a morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patient population, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Routine screening with fundus photography of morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients likely is not warranted </plain></SENT>
