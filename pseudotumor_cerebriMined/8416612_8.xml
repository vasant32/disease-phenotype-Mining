<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if orbital and cerebral CT can be used to distinguish <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients from those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, and to correlate CT findings with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with a clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> were compared with 20 age- and sex-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thin-section coronal and axial CT scans of the orbit and whole-brain axial CT scans were available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the optic nerve sheath, the degree of reversal of the optic nerve head, the presence and degree of empty sellae, and ventricular and sulcal sizes were evaluated without knowledge of whether or not the subject had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same parameters were compared for two subgroups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>: those with mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> and those with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> had significantly larger optic nerve sheaths than did control subjects (6.5 +/- 0.83 mm vs 5.4 +/- 0.69 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiologic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> with reversal of the optic nerve head was found in 12 of 17 patients compared with one of 20 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An empty sella was seen more frequently and to a greater degree in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> than in control subjects (16 vs seven) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight of nine patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> and four of eight patients with mild to moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> had reversal of the optic nerve head; the degree was greater in the group with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No difference in ventricular size or sulcal enlargement was seen between any of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The opening CSF pressures of the two groups with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> were not significantly different (348 +/- 80 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> vs 391 +/- 98 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In addition to the role of CT in excluding intracranial disease as a basis for the clinical syndrome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, thin-section CT of the orbits reveals a constellation of findings, including <z:mp ids='MP_0008529'>enlarged optic nerve</z:mp> sheaths, reversal of the optic nerve head, and empty sellae in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> in these patients correlates with more frequent and more severe reversal of the optic nerve head </plain></SENT>
