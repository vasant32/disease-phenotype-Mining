<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients should be investigated for signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in serum and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> females, aged 27-68 years participated in the study of associated symptoms, signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in serum, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty randomly selected age- and sex-matched females were also investigated for associated symptoms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in associated symptoms and diseases except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The values for orosomucoid, haptoglobin, IgG, IgM and tests for rheumatic and antinuclear factors were significantly increased in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> group compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values at the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lumbar CSF pressure was increased above 20 cm water in 79% and above 25 cm water in 42% in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> showed that the subarachnoidal space in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients were significantly smaller than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in serum, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and decreased subarachnoidal space were statistically significantly more common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, than in controls </plain></SENT>
