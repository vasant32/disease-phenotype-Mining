<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is both clinical and histopathologic evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0007994'>peripheral visual field loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic nerve degeneration</z:hpo> in longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> due to idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to look at the extent and distribution of axonal dropout in secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> due to IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both optic nerves from a 29-year-old man with a two year history of IIH were examined histologically and morphometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high-contrast <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (myelin) stain, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51403">paraphenylenediamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi>), and a semiautomated image analysis system were employed to resolve sufficiently the optic nerve fiber images for counts and for measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 80% and 90% losses of axons, respectively, in the right and left optic nerves consequent to IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003447'>axonal loss</z:hpo> in the peripheral area of each optic nerve was much more severe than that in inner sectors (= 0.001 for the right optic nerve and = 0.005 for the left) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This pattern of axonal dropout is consistent with the preservation of good central visual acuity despite devastating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic nerve atrophy</z:hpo>, and with the severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0007994'>peripheral visual field loss</z:hpo> noted in this patient </plain></SENT>
