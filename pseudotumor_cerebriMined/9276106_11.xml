<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the epidemiological profile for pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective case series was identified from a geographically limited region of 205,765 children aged 2-15 years at the only tertiary care pediatric hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pediatric neurologists and ophthalmologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Health records identified 35 children with ICD9 code 348.2 (benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) presenting between April 1, 1979 and March 31, 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After chart review, 29 cases were identified which satisfied modified Dandy's diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 29 cases ranged in age from 3-15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of symptomatic disease was 0.9 per 100,000 children (95% CI 0.6, 1.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases were 2.7 times more likely to be female (21/29, X2 p = .01) and twice as likely to be adolescent (age 12-15 years), (X2 p = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based upon these distinctions, the following estimates of age and sex specific disease incidence were derived (based upon 100,000 child years of exposure): male age 2-11 years: 0.4; male age 12-15 years: 0.8; female age 2-11 years: 1.1; female age 12-16 years: 2.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data appear to be unique for its the estimation of age and sex specific incidence rates for pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
