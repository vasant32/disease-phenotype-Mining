<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: To minimize the invasiveness and maximize the adequacy of Chiari decompression on pediatric patients, 0 degrees and 30 degrees endoscopes were adapted to perform the procedure of suboccipital craniectomy and upper cervical laminectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Via a 2-cm midline skin incision, craniectomy and C1 laminectomies were performed by using 0 degrees and 30 degrees lens endoscopes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From October 2003 to December 2006, twenty-six pediatric patients underwent the endoscopic procedure; 16 were male and 10 female, whose ages ranged from 18 months to 16 years (mean+/-SD: 8.07+/-4.45 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten of the 26 patients experienced suboccipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and cervical pain, 11 presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003298'>choking</z:mp>, frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/gaging and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, 6 presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424605" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">development delay</z:e> in fine motor function and speech, 5 experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, 6 with synrinx, 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> and other symptoms including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and numbness in extremities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) was used for the procedures in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 4 to 39 months (mean+/-SD: 20.69+/-10.10 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative improvement including complete and partial resolution of preoperative symptoms was shown in 92.3% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two cases have gained no improvement and one experienced postoperative complications - <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> - which was successfully controlled with antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No mortality, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270687" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudomeningocele</z:e>, cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> were seen in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average length of hospital stay was 2 nights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of the endoscope through a suboccipital craniectomy and upper cervical laminectomies has made Chiari decompression in pediatric population comparable with the conventional procedure in terms of minimal surgical invasiveness, recovery time, and complexity of the procedure </plain></SENT>
