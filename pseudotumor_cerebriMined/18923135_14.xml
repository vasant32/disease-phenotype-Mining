<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) in men vs women in a multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients with definite IIH seen at three university hospitals were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographics, associated factors, and visual function at presentation and follow-up were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups based on sex for statistical comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 721 consecutive patients, including 66 men (9%) and 655 women (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Men were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> (24% vs 4%, p &lt; 0.001) and were older (37 vs 28 years, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As their first symptom of IIH, men were less likely to report <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (55% vs 75%, p &lt; 0.001) but more likely to report visual disturbances (35% vs 20%, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men continued to have less <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (79% vs 89%, p = 0.01) at initial neuro-ophthalmologic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity and visual fields at presentation and last follow-up were significantly worse among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> for men compared with women was 2.1 (95% CI 1.4-3.3, p = 0.002) for at least <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> and 2.1 (95% CI 1.1-3.7, p = 0.03) for both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression supported sex as an independent risk factor for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Men with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) are twice as likely as women to develop severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Men and women have different symptom profiles, which could represent differences in symptom expression or symptom thresholds between the sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Men with IIH likely need to be followed more closely regarding visual function because they may not reliably experience or report other symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
