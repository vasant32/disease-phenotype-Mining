<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IIH manifests as severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most typically, IIH prevails in overweight females of childbearing age and its incidence is rising in parallel with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most accepted theory for the cause of IIH is reduced absorption of CSF due to elevated intracranial venous pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive MRI study, which includes structural and physiological imaging, was applied to characterize morphological and physiological differences between a homogeneous cohort of female IIH patients and an age- and BMI-similar control group to further elucidate the underlying pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A novel analysis of MRI measurements of blood and CSF flow to and from the cranial and spinal canal compartments employing lumped parameters modeling of the cranio-spinal biomechanics provided, for the first time, evidence for the involvement of the spinal canal compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CSF space in the spinal canal is less confined by bony structures compared with the cranial CSF, thereby providing most of the craniospinal compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that the contribution of spinal canal compliance in IIH is significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
