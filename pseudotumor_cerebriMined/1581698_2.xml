<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A report is given on three patients who developed spontaneous subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, together with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007902'>vitreous hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Terson's syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two patients the <z:hpo ids='HP_0007902'>vitreous hemorrhage</z:hpo> was unilateral and showed spontaneous resorption within 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The third patient presented with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0007902'>vitreous hemorrhage</z:hpo>, which first showed slow spontaneous resorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five months later, however, secondary vitreous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vitrectomy was therefore performed in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-operatively, both eyes developed focal vitreoretinal reproliferations with <z:mp ids='MP_0003099'>retinal tears</z:mp>, which led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> that was successfully treated by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of these observations we can make the following suggestions: in patients presenting with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0007902'>vitreous hemorrhage</z:hpo> one should first watch the spontaneous resorption of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If there is delayed blood resorption in bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0007902'>vitreous hemorrhage</z:hpo> and at the beginning of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, a pars plana vitrectomy should be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one patient an additional ocular symptom peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of the facial nerve; a second patient presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of the oculomotor nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both resolved spontaneously within 15 months </plain></SENT>
