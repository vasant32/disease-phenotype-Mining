<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients are referred to ophthalmologists to evaluate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> when they are found to have elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some of these patients have no clinical history consistent with intracranial hyper-tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine how often and how high patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> opening pressure could artificially elevate their CSF pressure to a pseudo-pathologic level by performing a Valsalva maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured CSF pressure at rest and after a Valsalva maneuver in 15 consecutive normotensive patients referred for CSF analysis to determine the frequency and amplitude of elevation of pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Manometry was performed in the standard lateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">decubitus</z:e> position with legs and knees extended and abdomen relaxed and then again during a Valsalva maneuver with hip flexion and bearing down against a closed glottis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 15 normotensive patients elevated their CSF pressure to levels greater than 25 cm water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient reached a maximum pressure of 47 cm water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interpretation: Artifactual elevation of CSF pressure may therefore occur frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Caution is advised before accepting a diagnosis of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in those lacking this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients require repeat CSF pressure measurements to either verify or refute previous recordings </plain></SENT>
