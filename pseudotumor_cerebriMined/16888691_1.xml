<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To show the utility of optic coherence tomography (OCT) in the follow up of the idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three girls, aged between 4 and 11 years, were diagnosed and subsequently followed with the help of OCT for an episode of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them had presented with non-specific symptoms such as visual disturbance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, stomach ache, and in one case <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> and torticolis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain imaging studies were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, however lumbar puncture found an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual fields were tested using Octopus automated perimetry and the optic nerve fiber layer (ONF) was measured by OCT at each of the attendances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The visual acuity was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, but two girls had evidence of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abducens nerve palsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fundus biomicroscopy revealed marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The thickness of the ONF was increased 2-3 times over normally expected levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The follow up and the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and azetazolamide was monitored by OCT, with a good outcome and return of the ONF levels to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one case, however, a recurrence was detected after three months without treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IIH in childhood is an uncommon condition, often with a different presentation from what is seen in teenagers and adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OCT is a useful technique helping in both the diagnosis and the follow-up of this disorder in children (Arch Soc Esp Oftalmol 2006; 81: 383-390) </plain></SENT>
