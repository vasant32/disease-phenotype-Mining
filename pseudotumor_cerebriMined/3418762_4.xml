<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 38 patients with combined head injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> requiring manipulation of mean airway pressure in order to achieve satisfactory oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were initially maintained on conventional ventilatory support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When entry criteria were met, patients were transitioned to high-frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) and cardiorespiratory variables were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HFPV resulted in a statistically significant decrease in intracranial pressures in patients when ICP remained greater than 15 mm Hg in spite of optimum medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory oxygenation was obtained at approximately half the level of CPAP and peak inspiratory pressure as that on conventional ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus HFPV provides an acceptable alternative method of ventilatory support in patients with combined head injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
