<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the function of human atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (hANP) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we examined hANP levels in the CSF of patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 16 controls without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> and 45 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 45 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> were divided into a group of 15 patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IH) and a group of 30 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pressure (NP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>hANP in both CSF (1-hANP) and serum (s-hANP) was measured by RIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with IH were followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed correlations between 1-hANP and other parameters of CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increase in concentration of 1-hANP was positively correlated with intracranial pressure (ICP; r = 0.72; p &lt; 0.01), but not with other CSF parameters or with s-hANP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concentration of 1-hANP appeared to be increased especially over a threshold value of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a followup study of patients with IH, changes in 1-hANP paralleled changes in ICP in every case (r = 0.79; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings strongly suggest that 1-hANP plays an important role in the regulation of ICP in humans </plain></SENT>
