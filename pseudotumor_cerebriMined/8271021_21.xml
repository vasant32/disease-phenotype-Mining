<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to re-examine this finding against a background of more intensive monitoring and data acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight severely head-injured patients with a Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score of 8 or less, whose admission CT scan did not show a mass lesion, midline shift, or effaced basal cisterns, underwent minute-to-minute recordings of arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) derived from blood pressure minus ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (ICP &gt; or = 20 mm Hg lasting longer than 5 minutes) was recorded in seven of the eight patients; in five cases the rise was pronounced in terms of both magnitude (ICP &gt; or = 30 mm Hg) and duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduced CPP (&lt; or = 60 mm Hg lasting longer than 5 minutes) was recorded in five patients </plain></SENT>
