<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1465 patients undergoing laparoscopic and open gastric bypass between 1995 and 2002 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a body mass index &gt;or= 35 kg/m(2) and major co-morbidities (group 1, n = 1045) were compared with patients with a body mass index &gt;or= 40 kg/m(2) with minor/no co-morbidities (group 2, n = 420) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group 1 patients were older (43 versus 36 years, P &lt; 0.001) and had a greater BMI (53 versus 50 kg/m(2), P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative complications were greater in group 1 than in group 2 and included leaks (4.1% versus 1.2%, P &lt; 0.0032) and wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (3.9% versus 1.4%, P &lt; 0.0133) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related mortality in the series was 1.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 10-fold greater in group 1 (2.3% versus 0.2%, P &lt; 0.0032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235329" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">small bowel obstruction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> was similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was significantly greater in group 2 (68% versus 62%, P &lt; 0.001) at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Resolution of group 1 co-morbidities was great, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 62%, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 75%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e> disease in 96%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> in 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Outcomes analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> surgery requires risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The very low mortality rates in published studies are likely explained by surgical treatment of low-risk patients with minor co-morbidities, such as those seen in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, despite the increased perioperative risk, the group 1 patients (with major co-morbidities) demonstrated dramatic resolution of their co-morbid conditions, justifying the decision to go forward with surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The data support a radical change in treatment philosophy in which morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals should be offered bariatric surgery before major co-morbid conditions develop as a strategy to decrease the operative risk </plain></SENT>
