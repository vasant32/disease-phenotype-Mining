<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors describe a newly recognized complication of lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt placement, namely, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> from leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a defect in the lumbar dura created by the shunt catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They report on a 47-year-old <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> woman with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who underwent routine placement of an LP shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following surgery, her <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> became worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two radionuclide shunt studies showed no anterograde tracer flow, suggesting either obstruction or a leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After shunt reservoir manometry indicated low pressure, spinal magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images revealed a CSF leak from the lumbar thecal sac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A computed tomography (CT) myelogram, performed by injection into the shunt reservoir, confirmed the presence of a leak by showing extravasation of contrast agent into the epidural space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated by application of a CT-guided blood patch at the leak site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Catheter-associated CSF leak is an unusual cause of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> that can occur following LP shunt placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case report outlines the clinical features of this condition, documents the neuroradiological findings, and demonstrates successful treatment with a blood patch </plain></SENT>
