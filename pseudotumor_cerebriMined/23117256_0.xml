<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This multicentre, observational, non-interventional consecutive cohort study included patients fulfilling ICHD-II criteria for primary cough <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (N = 10), primary exertional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (N = 11), or primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> associated with sexual activity (N = 20), as well as 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>-free controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient was evaluated clinically and underwent craniocervical MRV of the cranial circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> scans were interpreted centrally by blinded raters, using the Farb criteria proposed for idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stenosis was defined as a Farb score &lt;3 in left or right transverse sinuses or jugular veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> groups, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> were most frequently diffuse, severe, or very severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> duration was significantly shorter in patients with cough <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (median 6.5 versus 20 and 60 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An exploitable magnetic resonance venogram was obtained for 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stenosis was detected in none of the control group, but in 5/7 patients with primary cough <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> group, 2/10 patients with primary exertion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and 12/19 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> associated with sexual activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of stenosis was significantly different from the control group in the primary cough <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> associated with sexual activity groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headaches</z:hpo> provoked by cough and sexual activity are possibly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002624'>venous abnormalities</z:hpo> in a significant subgroup of affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As the literature shows conflicting results, this venous stenosis can be considered as a promoting factor </plain></SENT>
