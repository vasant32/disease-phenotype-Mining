<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both common carotid artery and internal jugular vein flows can change not only because of pathological processes of the vessels but also because of impedance of their distribution territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we analyze the relationship between flow velocity, one of the parameters of blood flow, and intracranial impedance variations which occur in cerebral concussion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vascular cerebral pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During our observations we noticed that the diastolic wave of the velocity curve of the common carotid artery is a very important signal of the flow variations in the internal carotid artery and, in turn, of variations in cerebral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the behaviour of the common carotid artery velocity curve in our patients both during clinical disease development and during the action of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phases of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the ultrasonic patterns during antiedema action were similar to the ones obtained during the recovery period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We were able to note some differences and some similarities of the curve <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in relation to generalized or focal causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This may be very important considering that at present no non-invasive and therefore repeatable technique is available for monitoring cerebral blood flow in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
