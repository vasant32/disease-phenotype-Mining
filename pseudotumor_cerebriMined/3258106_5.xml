<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> young women with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> were studied with high-field-strength (1.5 T) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging to demonstrate increased water content in the brains of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heavily T2-weighted studies were obtained for 10 patients, and balanced (long TRs, short TEs, spin density, proton density) pulse sequences were obtained for four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the studies of morphologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> periventricular white matter and developed a white matter water index to determine if a slight increase in signal was present that could be ascribed to low levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison was made to an age-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also examined five patients with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the 11 patients had focal areas of increased signal in their periventricular white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presumably, these are areas of increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> above the background that could not be detected on the CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The white matter water index for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was an average of 0.479 (+/- 0.015), while that of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> group was 0.520 (+/- 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This indicates an increase in the white matter water signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe this represents a diffuse low level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with previous estimates of the increase in brain water in patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients with focally abnormal proton studies demonstrated similar abnormalities on their <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> studies </plain></SENT>
