<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of flow out of the distal portion of the catheter once in its final position can be difficult, especially in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new technique to improve placement of the peritoneal catheter involves laparoscopic catheter insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed laparoscopic-assisted LP shunt placement for IIH on four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Improvement in preoperative IIH symptomatology was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No laparoscopic-procedure-related complications were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No problems were noted in shunt functioning and none of the shunts have required revision surgery at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LP shunt related complications were noted in two of the four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications included bilateral lower extremity <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263855" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lumbar radiculopathy</z:e> in one patient that resolved with a short course of gabapentin, spinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in one patient that resolved with bed rest and fluids, and development of a small intracranial subdural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206620" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hygroma</z:e> without mass effect in one patient that is asymptomatic and being followed without clinical consequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic insertion of the abdominal catheter is safe and effective and does not appear to independently cause an increased risk of complications </plain></SENT>
