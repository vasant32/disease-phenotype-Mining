<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STATE OF THE ART: Despite a large number of hypotheses and publications over the past decade, the etiology of IIH is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There continues to be no evidence-based consensus or formal guidelines regarding management and treatment of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment studies show that the diagnostic lumbar puncture is a valuable intervention beyond its diagnostic importance, and that weight management is critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, many questions remain, regarding the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting procedures, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and cerebral transverse venous sinus stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Identification of subgroups of patients at high-risk for irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, such as black patients, men, morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients, and patients with fulminant IIH, helps determine management approaches and refine follow-up strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PERSPECTIVE: Better understanding of the pathophysiology and ongoing clinical trials will hopefully help inform treatment strategies over the next few years </plain></SENT>
