<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to understand better how damage to the anterior visual pathway may affect the relationship between the visual and pupillomotor systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549122" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relative afferent pupillary defect</z:e> and the interocular difference in visual field mean deviation (determined by the Humphrey Field Analyzer Statpac program) were correlated in 137 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A moderate linear correlation (r = .66) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 25 patients tested by both static and kinetic perimetry, the correlation could not be significantly improved by considering field loss outside of 30 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation was further studied in four subcategories of diagnosis: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> (n = 36), idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n = 26), compressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> (n = 14), and anterior ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In compressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> and idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the difference in mean deviation between the two eyes was associated with a larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549122" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relative afferent pupillary defect</z:e> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> and anterior ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo>, the correlation was the poorest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that diseases of the afferent visual system may not necessarily affect visual threshold (as tested by static perimetry) and the pupillary light reflex (a suprathreshold test) in the same way </plain></SENT>
