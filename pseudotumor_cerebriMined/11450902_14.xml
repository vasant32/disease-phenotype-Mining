<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of 53 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> from a tertiary center neuroophthalmology practice were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients were identified who had a history of snoring, difficulty sleeping, or daytime <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data from polysomnograms were tabulated to determine the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apneas</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopneas</z:mp>, and arousals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen of 37 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> underwent polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were two men and 12 women varying in age from 24 to 58 years (mean, 39.4 +/- 11.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> with body mass indexes varying from 33.0 to 63.2 (mean, 46.0 +/- 9.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> was made in six and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1319384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper airway resistance syndrome</z:e> in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sleep-related breathing problems were common in our patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was common in these patients and may be playing a causative role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> and idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> patients who have symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> should be further evaluated for the presence of sleep-related breathing problems </plain></SENT>
