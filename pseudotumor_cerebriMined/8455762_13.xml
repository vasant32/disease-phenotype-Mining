<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of 143 patients who underwent LP shunting between 1974 and 1991 was therefore performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the time of shunt insertion was 3.3 years (range, 18 d to 17.8 yr), and the indication for shunting was: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (81%), cerebrospinal fluid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (12%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 5.7 years (range, 5 d to 17.5 yr), and during this period, there were five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> of which one was shunt related (2.5 yr post-shunt insertion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the types of LP shunt used during the study period, the T-tube shunt (101 patients) fared significantly better (P = 0.003) than the percutaneous type (42 patients), and the overall survival characteristics for the T-tube shunt approximated those seen for ventriculoperitoneal shunts, with a 50% probability of remaining free of malfunctions for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high rate of migration (19%) was partially responsible for the poor performance of the percutaneous-type shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By the end of the study, 40 patients (28%) had been converted to ventricular shunts, and this rate of conversion was similar for both shunt types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LP shunts have certain advantages over other forms of cerebrospinal fluid diversion and were successfully used for various clinical conditions during this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
