<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to characterize the incidence of and significance of 2 novel MRI findings: narrowing of Meckel's cave and of cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six patients with a condition diagnosed as PTC based on clinical history were retrospectively reviewed, and their MRI studies were assessed for previously reported imaging findings associated with PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maximal diameters of the cavernous sinuses, Meckel's caves, and ONSs were measured along with those of age-matched controls on axial T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Meckel's caves and cavernous sinuses are significantly (P &lt; 0.01) narrowed in patients (mean diameters: 0.41 and 0.25 cm) versus controls (0.54 and 0.36 cm), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ONS was enlarged in patients with a mean diameter of 0.65 cm versus 0.54 cm (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meckel's cave narrowing and ONS enlargement seem to be better indicators of PTC than cavernous sinus narrowing, with sensitivities of 78.3% and 86.9% and specificities of 84.8% and 76.1% versus 60.9% and 76.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This finding of narrowed Meckel's caves in PTC may be clinically useful as a novel imaging finding seen on routine MRI studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Optic nerve sheath enlargement is also confirmed as an important finding in PTC </plain></SENT>
