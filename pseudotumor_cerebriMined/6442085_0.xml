<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that the hypotensive effect of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> depended on the state of the water-electrolyte homeostasis, the time of medication with the agents, the severity of the patient's condition, and the initial ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50504">osmotic diuretics</z:chebi> was highest in normoosmia and normonatriemia in ICP of 20-45 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medication with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50504">osmotic diuretics</z:chebi> and algurin in the first 2-3 days after the injury as usually attended by the "yield phenomenon"; the hypotensive effect of algurin in this period was less manifest </plain></SENT>
