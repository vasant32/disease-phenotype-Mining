<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report their experience with stereotactic placement of VP shunts for IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the clinical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom stereotaxis was used to guide the placement of a VP shunt for IIH at their institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> shunts were placed using stereotactic guidance to target the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were contacted at a mean postoperative interval of 15.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patients were lost to follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors identified 13 patients who underwent placement of a stereotactically guided VP shunt for IIH over a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A trial of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> or steroid therapy had failed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior surgical treatments included optic nerve sheath fenestrations in seven patients and cerebrospinal fluid diversionary procedures, other than stereotactic VP shunt procedures, in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients reported excellent or good durable symptomatic relief at the time of follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered progression of visual deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients experienced persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> following the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients required a revision of the VP shunt for technical failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactically guided VP shunt placement is an effective and durable treatment option in many cases of IIH that are refractory to more traditional medical and surgical approaches </plain></SENT>
