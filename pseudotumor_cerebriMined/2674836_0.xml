<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of them suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and ICP increased because of her VP shunt-insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the other case <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> and a rise in intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases, transcranial Doppler sonography showed a decrease in blood flow (CBF) velocity and an increase in the Pourcelot index in the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quick or gradual reduction of the ICP led to an increase in CBF velocity and a decrease in the Pourcelot index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of experiences of the authors, transcranial Doppler sonography is a valuable method of verifying the elevation of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suitable for measuring the effect of treatment necessitated by the elevation of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The method is non-invasive, quick and it can be freely repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore it is applicable for monitoring the dynamic of ICP </plain></SENT>
