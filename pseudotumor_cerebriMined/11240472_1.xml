<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Infrequent in children, benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>) is most often observed in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Careful diagnosis requires eliminating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other etiologies of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most often medical, its treatment must be rapid to avoid permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a surgical procedure is necessary when vision is threatened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present our experience with this pathology and discuss its clinical aspects, its etiologies, and the physiopathological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on children who presented benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> confirmed by neuroradiological and neurosurgical examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These examinations also served to specify the responsible etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ophthalmologic examinations, adapted to the child's age and clinical status, included visual acuity testing, optic disc evaluation, ocular motility testing, and visual field evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progression of visual acuity and the topic disc was analyzed after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnosis of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was confirmed in 22 children (12 boys and 10 girls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and visual disturbance such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028866" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oculomotor nerve palsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> was present in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment was successful in 7 children; however, the remaining 15 patients required a lumboperitoneal shunt because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e>, no response to the medical therapy, or threatened vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The physiopathological mechanisms of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, an uncommon condition in children, are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It can be associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other intracranial or medullary expansive lesions should be eliminated before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The causes of this syndrome are not the same for pediatric and adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although medical therapy is usually sufficient to normalize the intracranial pressure, a lumboperitoneal shunt is at times required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The role of the ophthalmologist is important in detecting a possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> or papilla abnormality and in ensuring proper treatment follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ophtalmologists are involved in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> and the monitoring of visual function, an important element in evaluating treatment efficacy </plain></SENT>
