<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective study at a tertiary care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a final diagnosis of IIH from July 2001 to March 2005 were included and subjected to detailed neuro-ophthalmologic examination and endoscopic endonasal optic nerve fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative visual acuity and the perimetry was compared with the preoperative status, and the results were analyzed using the chi2 test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Of the 18 patients included in the study, 17 had improvement in vision postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had visual deterioration in the other eye as well, and of these, 12 had improvement, obviating the need for surgery on the other side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications were minimal and in the form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154933" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">synechiae</z:e> in two of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: A number of procedures have been described for the management of this entity, and each is associated with a significant morbidity; therefore, there was a need for a minimally invasive procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The procedure adopted in the series is minimally invasive and is associated with a 94.5% success rate and minimal morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic endonasal optic nerve fenestration is a safe, minimally invasive, and extremely effective procedure for the management of IIH </plain></SENT>
