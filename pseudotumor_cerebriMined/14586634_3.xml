<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most of the reports in the literature deal with children with lumbo-peritoneal shunts and emphasize the pathogenic role of the cranio-spinal pressure differential across the foramen magnum brought about by this type of shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In the present report, the authors describe two further cases of symptomatic acquired Chiari type-I malformation observed in two adolescents operated on for correction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> in one (lumbo-peritoneal shunt) and of a suprasellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cyst</z:hpo> (cysto-ventriculo-peritoneal shunt) in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both subjects, both the clinical manifestations and the cerebellar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> regressed after supratentorial cranial expansion, without the need for any manipulation of the shunt devices implanted earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: These results, together with the observation of the concomitant upward and downward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> of the cerebellum in both patients, indicate that secondary craniocephalic disproportion plays a relevant role in the genesis of acquired Chiari type-I malformation in children bearing extrathecal CSF shunts </plain></SENT>
