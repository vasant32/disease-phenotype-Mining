<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is a well-recognized disorder of unknown etiology associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuroimaging, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition, found mostly among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> females of childbearing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical features of IIH in patients older than 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review (1998-2007) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients older than 40 years who were diagnosed with IIH based on the Modified Dandy Criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty three of the 200 IIH patients in the institutional database fulfilled study entry criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They included 22 females and one male whose mean age was 51.4 years (range 41-79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coexisting systemic arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was found in 13 (56.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (73.9%) had symptoms attributable to elevated ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common presenting symptoms were visual; mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> and transient visual obscuration (15/17 patients, 88.23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (64.7%) complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and another 4 (23.5%) of pulsatile intracranial noise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average follow up period was 21.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that IIH among individuals older than 40 years of age may be underreported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These patients are more likely to present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> and with more visual disturbances, but with fewer complaints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> than the younger IIH population </plain></SENT>
