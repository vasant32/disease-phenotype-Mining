<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors evaluated the efficacy of treating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) by using a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt with a programmable valve and ventricular access device (VAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients in whom PTC was diagnosed were treated using LP shunts with programmable valves and wand-guided placement of a VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and high opening pressure during spinal tap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 18 months (range 3-72 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When patients complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> that suggested shunt malfunction, the ventricular reservoir was tapped at bedside to assess ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The programmable valve was adjusted based on the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The VAD was tapped in 21 patients, and the LP valve was redialed in 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Shunt malfunction was diagnosed accurately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 10 patients undergoing revision were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> found to have shunt obstruction except 1 whose valve was replaced because it could not be reprogrammed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient treated with a shunt developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The VAD was exposed in 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or wound breakdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The LP shunt was revised in 2 patients who developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270687" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudomeningocele</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235329" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">small bowel obstruction</z:e> responded to conservative management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> despite documented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>That is, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> were unrelated to shunt function, and these patients were referred to a pain management clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lumboperitoneal shunts with programmable valves effectively controlled the outflow of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid to ameliorate the symptoms of PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The VAD permitted assessment of ICP and thus, indirectly, LP shunt function, and benefits outweighed risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The programmable valve permitted cerebrospinal fluid flow to be adjusted based on patients' clinical status and ICP to be measured by the VAD </plain></SENT>
