<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its true incidence is as yet unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study, the co-occurrence of IIH and aCL-Abs was looked for among a relatively large group of patients diagnosed with IIH or PTC in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic during the years of 1992-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent routine blood tests and the presence of activated protein C resistance and protein S and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ACL-Abs were determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The co-occurrence of IIH and aCL-Abs was found in three out of 37 patients (8.1%), which is higher than the incidence of aCL-Abs in the general population but considerably lower than that reported in two previously published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aCL-Ab positive patients in our series were significantly older and thinner than those in whom antibodies were undetected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it seems that patients with this association should be considered as a unique subgroup of IIH </plain></SENT>
