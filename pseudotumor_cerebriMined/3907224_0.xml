<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 1st and 2nd variants indicate diminution of the drainage function of the cerebral submeningeal space, which does not exclude the presence of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath>, one of tumorous genesis among others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The third variant which reveals open internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>) with diminished drainage activity of the submeningeal space of the brain excludes the existence of a three-dimensional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath>, that of tumorous origin also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome of unclear genesis disturbed circulation of cerebrospinal fluid was always attended by its impaired resorption; not only a diminished reaction (function) but an accelerated reaction of drainage of the cerebrospinal fluid from its passages may occur when the maintaining drainage function of the submeningeal space of the spinal cord is manifested </plain></SENT>
