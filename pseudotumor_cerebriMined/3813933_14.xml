<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>Visual loss</z:hpo> was found in 75% of eyes using the manual strategy and in 77.5% of eyes with automated threshold perimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> is 50% greater than any previously reported series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> major defects detected were present with both types of perimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both strategies were more sensitive for documenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> than previously described strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> is determined by the degree and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, a specific sensitive strategy, rather than routine screening perimetry, should be used for determination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
