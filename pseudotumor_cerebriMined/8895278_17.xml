<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to monitor jugular venous oxygen saturation (Sjvo2) during surgery for evacuation of traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial mass</z:e> lesions, to determine the incidence and the causes of jugular venous desaturation, and to assess the usefulness of Sjvo2 monitoring in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five severely head injured patients were monitored during 27 surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the start of the surgical procedure, the median Sjvo2 was 47% (range 25%-89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (63%) of the patients had a Sjvo2 less than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients had extremely low Sjvo2 values (&lt; or = 30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon evacuation of the intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, there was a significant (P &lt; 0.001) increase in the median Sjvo2 to 65% (range 50%-88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was the primary cause of the low Sjvo2, as confirmed by the response to surgical evacuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Hypotension</z:hpo> (mean arterial pressure &lt; 80 mm Hg) was a contributing factor in seven of the cases of jugular desaturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The definitive treatment of a traumatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> is surgical evacuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, during the period prior to evacuation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, jugular venous desaturation was common, suggesting that monitoring Sjvo2 might provide useful information about the adequacy of cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
