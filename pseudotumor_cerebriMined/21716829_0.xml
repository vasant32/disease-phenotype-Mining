<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though earlier confined to excluding intracranial lesions, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in recent years has been shown to identify intracranial changes from prolonged raised CSF pressure, suggestive of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the MRI and TOF (time-of-flight) venography findings involving the orbit, sella tursica and cerebral venous structures in a 45-year-old lady with IIH and illustrate their reversibility ("flip-flop") following CSF drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our case highlights the role of imaging in evaluation and follow-up of patients with IIH, without the need for repeated lumbar punctures to monitor pressures </plain></SENT>
