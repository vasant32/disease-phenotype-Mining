<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some studies indicate that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) produce increases in circulating vasopressin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the hypothesis that endogenous release of vasopressin decreases blood flow to the choroid plexus during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow to the choroid plexus was measured in anesthetized rabbits using microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> increased cerebral blood flow more than twofold but had little effect on blood flow to the choroid plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> produced a marked increase in blood flow to the choroid plexus in the presence of a vasopressin V1-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, [d(<z:chebi fb="5" ids="29357,29358,29360,29361,51375,51376">CH2</z:chebi>)5Tyr(Me)]AVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, blood flow to the choroid plexus decreased from 409 +/- 42 to 295 +/- 25 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1 (means +/- SE; P &lt; 0.05 vs. control) when ICP was increased from 1 to 40 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vasopressin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> inhibited the decrease in blood flow to the choroid plexus in response to increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus release of vasopressin during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and increased ICP have a constrictor effect on blood vessels of the choroid plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of vasopressin increased minimally during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and increased ICP, which suggests that sources of vasopressin other than plasma affect blood vessels of the choroid plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that endogenous vasopressin may play a protective role during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> by a negative feedback mechanism to reduce blood flow to the choroid plexus </plain></SENT>
