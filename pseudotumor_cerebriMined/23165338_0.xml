<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e> that typically affects <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women of childbearing age, but can also occur in paediatric populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients usually present with diffuse, daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and visual disturbances, but either symptom can occur in isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with IIH often have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e>; however, IIH without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> is fairly common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of IIH is unknown; the high incidence of comorbid bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (BTSS) in patients with IIH suggests that the two conditions are linked, although no direct causal relationship has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure monitoring or lumbar puncture-which provides immediate symptomatic relief-are important in making a diagnosis of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Current treatments for IIH include weight reduction, medical treatment, CSF diversion surgery, optic nerve sheath fenestration and, potentially, endovascular stenting (in patients with BTSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> (which can be substantial) is the main goal of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and IIH recurrence are not uncommon after treatment, and regular follow-up is, therefore, warranted even in patients who achieve remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This Review provides an update of current knowledge of the aetiology, pathophysiology and treatment of IIH </plain></SENT>
