<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> is the only serious complication of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> secondary to idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) and some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optic nerve sheath decompression (ONSD) has been shown to improve or stabilize visual function in patients with IIH, while its role in CVT is yet to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with optic nerve sheath decompression for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in IIH and CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective noncomparative, interventional study, 41 eyes of 21 patients with IIH and CVT and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> underwent ONSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), visual fields, pupillary light reflex, optic nerve sheath diameter on B-scan and resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> which were evaluated preoperatively and at follow-up at four days, two weeks, one month, three months and final follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 7/41 eyes with absent light perception preoperatively, the functional outcome was analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following ONSD BCVA and visual fields stabilized or improved in 32/34 (94%) eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant improvement in BCVA, visual fields and pupillary light reflex occurred over the three month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical success was indicated by reduction in optic nerve diameter and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> resolution occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The outcome in the IIH and CVT groups was comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four eyes with absent light perception showed marginal improvement in visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four eyes had transient benign complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Optic nerve sheath decompression is an effective and safe procedure to improve or stabilize vision in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> caused by IIH and CVT </plain></SENT>
