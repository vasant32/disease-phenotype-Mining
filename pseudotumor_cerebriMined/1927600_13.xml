<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From patients who were treated with a shunt another CSF sample was obtained one week after shunt implantation by puncture of the antechamber of the valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CSF concentrations of NSE, S-100, CK and CK-BB after cannulation were found to be of the same order as found in patients with severe head injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One week after shunt implantation the concentrations of S-100, CK and CK-BB had returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, while the NSE concentrations remained elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the sampling procedure may result in contamination of CSF with NSE, S-100, CK and CK-BB and they should be taken into account in the prognostic evaluation of enzyme concentrations after brain injury </plain></SENT>
