<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> is a common treatment but has never been examined in a randomised controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this pilot trial are to prospectively evaluate the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, to explore various outcome measures and to inform the design of a definitive trial in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients were recruited from six centres over 23 months and randomised to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (n = 25) or no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms, body weight, visual function and health-related quality-of-life measures were recorded over a 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recruited patients had typical features of mild IIH and most showed improvement, with 44% judged to have IIH in remission at the end of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Difficulties with recruitment were highlighted as well as poor compliance with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> therapy (12 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A composite measure of IIH status was tested, and the strongest concordance with final disease status was seen with perimetry (Somers' D = 0.66) and optic disc appearance (D = 0.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the study data, a sample size of 320 would be required to demonstrate a 20% treatment effect in a substantive trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials in IIH require pragmatic design to involve sufficiently large numbers of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies should incorporate weighted composite scores to reflect the relative importance of common outcome measures in IIH </plain></SENT>
