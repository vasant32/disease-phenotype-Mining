<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and 57 patients were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coronal T2 weighted fat suppressed FSE images were obtained in 11 minutes with an in plane resolution of 0.39 x 0.39 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The optic nerve and its sheath containing CSF were clearly differentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels were often visible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In demyelinating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> and in anterior ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> high signal within the nerve was readily delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>Meningiomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> involving the optic nerve were precisely visualised both in the orbit and intracranially </plain></SENT>
