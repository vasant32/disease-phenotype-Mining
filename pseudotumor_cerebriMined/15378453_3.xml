<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate patients in a Columbian hospital who satisfied Friedman and Jacobson criteria for idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two groups of patients, with throbbing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> (TH) and heaviness/oppressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">HOH</z:chebi>), were correlated with International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Society classification criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found 16 patients, 14 of whom were females (87.5%), with a mean age of 27 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients had a history of two months or more (43.7%), 1-2 months (25%) and 2 weeks (18.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients were found to be suffering from TH and nine had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">HOH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the TH group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> were hemicranial (50%), frontal (33.3%), moderate (33.3%), severe (66.6%), got worse with activity (100%), with sickness/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (83.3%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000613'>photophobia</z:hpo> (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them had clinical parameters similar to those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">HOH</z:chebi> group <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> were global (33.3%), hemicranial (22.2%), frontal and occipital (22.2%), moderate (66.6%), severe (33.3%), and with sickness/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (55.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>66.6% of them had clinical parameters similar to those of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (NCDH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On carrying out a physical examination in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of the abducent nerve was found in 31.2% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> in 93.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average opening pressure was 27 cmH2O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Computerised axial tomography scanning revealed unspecific anomalies in 18.7% and they were also observed with magnetic resonance imaging in 31.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Associated pathologies were found in six patients (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological treatment was effective in 93.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no relapses or sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is a malady affecting young people, mainly females, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and symptoms similar to those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and NCDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> suggestive of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was found in 31.2-93.7% of patients </plain></SENT>
