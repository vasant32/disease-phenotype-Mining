<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Infusions of varying volumes of fluid into the subarachnoid space over the convexity of the brain in the right parietal area were carried out, recording then changes in respiration and arterial blood pressure, heart rate and ECG, paying attention to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and ischaemic myocardial changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure rise caused a sympathetic system response with increased arterial blood pressure, <z:mp ids='MP_0002626'>increased heart rate</z:mp> and various <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, even <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed ischaemic changes, even those suggesting electric gap presence, were reversible indicating absence of fixed structural changes </plain></SENT>
