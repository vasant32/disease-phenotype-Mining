<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Shunt valve resistance changes using a specialized magnetic programming device permit noninvasive changes to cerebrospinal fluid drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In selected cases between 2001 and 2005, patients and families used shunt valve programming devices at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines the safety and efficacy of this practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of patients who had been given a shunt valve-programming device for home use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A survey was mailed to patients or family members requesting information regarding their experiences with the shunt valve programming device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient and family responses were tabulated and a statistical analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients or families returned the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median patient age was 19.6 years (range, 6-48 yr); 25% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, one had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cyst</z:hpo>, and two had slit ventricle syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had lumboperitoneal shunts, one had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, three had cisterna magna shunts, and one had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cyst</z:hpo>-to-peritoneal shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No adverse events were attributable to the use of the home shunt valve programmer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five percent of respondents used the programmer at least once every week, 40% used the programmer between once a week and once a month, and 25% used the programmer less frequently than once per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, 85% of respondents reported that they benefited "very much" from the use of a home shunt valve programmer and 15% of respondents benefited "somewhat." CONCLUSION: Providing shunt valve programming devices to selected patients for home use is a safe practice associated with high patient satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the selection of appropriate patients, comprehensive patient education, and close patient-physician communication are crucial to the success of this practice </plain></SENT>
