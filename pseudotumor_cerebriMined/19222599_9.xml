<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) remains unclear and as such it remains a diagnosis of exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum cytokine and chemokine profiles associated with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Semiquantitative assessment with cytokine antibody arrays was used to detect the relative expression of 42 different cytokines and chemokines in the CSF and serum of 8 IIH patients and 8 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, quantitative assay with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was performed for chemokine CCL2, interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1alpha), and leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cytokine antibody array showed elevated levels of CCL2 in the CSF and CCL7, CCL8, IL-1alpha, and leptin levels in serum in IIH patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent quantitative assessment with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay showed significantly elevated CSF CCL2 in IIH patients compared with controls (P &lt; .01) but there was no significant difference in leptin and IL-1alpha levels between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first report demonstrating differences in cytokine expression in the serum and CSF in IIH patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the pathogenesis of IIH is unclear, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the cytokine expression reported here may help understand the pathogenesis of this condition </plain></SENT>
