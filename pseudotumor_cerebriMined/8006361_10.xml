<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of repeated lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure monitoring in evaluating the response to therapy is also demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Continuous 1-hour lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure monitoring was done in eight children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> on admission and at weekly intervals until the baseline pressure had normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(One child had two episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> until <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> had cleared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raised intracranial pressure</z:e> was present on admission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six children had an increased baseline cerebrospinal fluid pressure, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> was diagnosed in three children on account of an <z:mp ids='MP_0000306'>abnormal pulse</z:mp> wave and/or pressure waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean baseline pressure was significantly lower after the 1st week of treatment than on admission (P = .007) and normalized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients within 6 weeks of start of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children had a rapid clinical response </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The good correlation found between the clinical response and normalization of baseline cerebrospinal fluid pressure suggests that clinical monitoring of treatment is adequate in most children with this condition </plain></SENT>
