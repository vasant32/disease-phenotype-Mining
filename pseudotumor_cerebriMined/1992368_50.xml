<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify the symptoms and coexisting medical conditions associated with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), we administered an 83-item questionnaire at the time of diagnosis to 50 IIH patients and 100 aged-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of the IIH patients were women; the mean age was 33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and recent <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> were much more common among patients than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptoms most commonly reported by IIH patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (94%), transient visual obscurations (TVO) (68%), and intracranial noises (ICN) (58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Daily occurrence of these symptoms was much more common among patients than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Controls also reported these and other IIH symptoms, but at lower frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several conditions previously associated with IIH were no more common in patients than controls including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo>, pregnancy, antibiotic intake, and use of oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that previous studies of IIH, mostly uncontrolled and retrospective, have underestimated the frequency of symptoms in IIH patients and reported chance and spurious associations with common medical conditions and medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The profile of a young <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and either TVO or ICN should alert the clinician to the diagnosis of IIH, especially when the symptoms occur daily </plain></SENT>
