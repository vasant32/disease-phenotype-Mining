<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report 3 patients in their sixties presenting with a space occupying lesion which was the first manifestation of CAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were operated with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263885" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cerebral tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases, macroscopy was similar, the lesions were superficial in the cerebral cortex and the preoperative diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cavernoma</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the lesions consisted of a large inflammatory granuloma with numerous lipophages and siderophages surrounding capillaries with prominent endothelial cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjacent cerebral cortex showed reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our three cases, CT scan and MRI changes were related to the presence of an inflammatory granuloma around foci of haemorrhage and amyloid laden vessels </plain></SENT>
