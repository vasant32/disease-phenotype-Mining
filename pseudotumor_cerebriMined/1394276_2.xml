<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in children less than 18 month old with venous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the change in ventricular size in craniectomized animals (simulating children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000270'>open sutures</z:hpo>) with occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New Zealand rabbits weighing 1500-1800 g were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of 2 ml 7:3 ketamine (100 mg/ml): Rompun (xylazine) (20 mg/ml) solution </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The periosteum was reflected laterally and a craniectomy performed with microscopic magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dura was exposed overlying both cerebral hemispheres and the superior sagittal sinus from its origin to the torcular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In five control animals, the scalp was then closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In ten experimental animals, small incisions were made in the dura just lateral to the superior sagittal sinus with a no. 11 scalpel and then with microscopic magnification the sinus was coagulated with bipolar cautery and transected; the scalp was then closed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We observed a small but statistically significant increase in ventricular size in the experimental group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This model provides evidence that venous sinus occlusion in animals with expandable crania can produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
