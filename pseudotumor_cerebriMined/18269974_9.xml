<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is a syndrome of unknown cause characterized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While imaging often reveals a stenosis of the transverse sinuses, the role of this feature in IIH has been in dispute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> have been found to actually be suffering from a milder form of IIH without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (IIHWOP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients often demonstrate hypertensive B-waves and plateau-like waves upon continuous ICP monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, we presented modeling studies which suggest that the sinus stenosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> of IIH are physiological manifestations of a stable state of elevated pressures that exists when the transverse sinus is sufficiently collapsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many of the features of IIH were explained by this model but the prevalence of pathological ICP wave-forms observed in IIHWOP remained unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The model presented here is a modified version of a previous model with a semi-collapsible sinus represented by a refined downstream Starling-like resistor based on experimental data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The qualitative behavior of this model is presented in terms of the collapsibility of the transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For a sufficiently rigid sinus, there is a unique stable state of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the degree of collapsibility increases, there is a Hopf bifurcation, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> state becomes unstable, low-frequency, high-amplitude ICP waves prevail, and small perturbations can lead to hypertensive ICP spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As the collapsibility increases further, so does the duration of the waves, until they are replaced by two stable states: one of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pressures and one of elevated pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this parameter domain, temporary perturbations can now cause permanent transitions between states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The model presented here retains the capability of our previous model to elucidate many features of IIH and additionally provides insight into the prevalence of the low-frequency, high-amplitude waves observed in IIHWOP </plain></SENT>
