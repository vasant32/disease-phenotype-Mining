<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies document a high failure rate for this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to explore the feasibility of placing ventriculoperitoneal shunts under stereotactic control into patients with IIH as an alternative to lumboperitoneal shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with IIH for whom medical management had failed underwent stereotactic implantation of ventriculoperitoneal shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Shunt placement was successful and uncomplicated in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of seven patients experienced complete resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining two patients showed resolving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of seven patients experienced resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient continued to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> despite a radionuclide study demonstrating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> shunt function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that stereotactic ventriculoperitoneal shunting may be a reasonable alternative to lumboperitoneal shunting in those patients with IIH who require surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
