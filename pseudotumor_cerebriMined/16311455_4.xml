<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A non-invasive method of assessing intracranial pressure (ICP) would be of benefit to patients with abnormal cerebral pathology that could give rise to changes in ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, it would assist the regular monitoring of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated a technique using tympanic membrane displacement (TMD) measurements, which has been reported to provide a reliable, non-invasive measure of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A group of 135 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> patients was studied, as well as 13 patients with benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and a control group of 77 volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TMD measurements were carried out using the Marchbanks measurement system analyser and compared between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 36 patients, invasive measurements of ICP carried out at the same time were compared with the TMD values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A highly significant relationship was found between TMD and ICP but intersubject variability was high and the predictive value of the technique low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taking the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of ICP to be 10-15 mmHg, the predictive limits of the regression are an order of magnitude wider than this and therefore Vm cannot be used as a surrogate for ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TMD measurements do not provide a reliable non-invasive measure of ICP in patients with shunted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
