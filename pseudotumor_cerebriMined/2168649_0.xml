<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CSFP increased sharply during preanesthesia, in administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38870">inhalation anesthetics</z:chebi>, and under the effect of inadequate anesthesia during trephination of the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rise in CSFP in preanesthesia can be reduced by a combination of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> with neuroleptanalgesics the administration of which is continued for up to 2-3 minutes of artificial lung ventilation through a mask </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To correct the rise in CSFP during the use of 70% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi>, the authors recommend preliminary 5-10-minute anesthesia with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29796">N2O </z:chebi>+ O2 (50:50) mixture and administration of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> (2-3 mg/kg) or seduxen (0.2-0.3 mg/kg) in the first minutes of the postintubation period </plain></SENT>
