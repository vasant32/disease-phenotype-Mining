<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcome was favourable in both children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure (ICP) was recorded during the pre-, intra- and postoperative periods and during each specific step of the surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Craniectomy alone induced a decrease in ICP of 45% (40 torr) in case 1 and 30% (35 torr) in case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although this method remains controversial, given the lack of controlled trials, it can offer a salvage procedure in children with rapidly worsening intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, allowing survival without disabling neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
