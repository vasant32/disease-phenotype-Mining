<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography, two groups of patients could be identified: (i) one group with an intrinsic venous outflow obstruction (intrinsic); and (ii) a non-intrinsically obstructed (extrinsic) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI flow quantification studies of the cerebral arteries and veins, measuring arterial blood inflow as well as superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and straight sinus (ST) outflow, were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography confirmed that there were 12 intrinsic patients and 12 extrinsic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the intrinsic group, total arterial inflow was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; however, the SSS outflow was reduced by 35% (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial inflow in extrinsic patients was 55% higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (p=0.0001); however, the SSS flow was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In intrinsic venous outflow obstruction, total cerebral inflow is maintained despite a reduction in outflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the idiopathic cases, there was cerebral hyperaemia suggesting a derangement of autoregulation </plain></SENT>
