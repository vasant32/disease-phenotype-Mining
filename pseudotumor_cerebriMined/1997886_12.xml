<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure was analyzed using the percentage of time that it exceeded 20 mm Hg and the maximum value recorded during the first 72 hours after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Memory measures included recall of word lists, prose recall, and visual memory for designs that were obtained 6 months (n = 149) and 1 year (n = 132) after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> occurred in more than half of the Traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Data Bank cohort who met the criteria for the neurobehavioral follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis disclosed an effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> on some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, measures of memory at 6 months, whereas the results were negative for the 1-year follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the elevation of intracranial pressure exerts little if any effect on later memory functioning, and that any effect it does have diminishes over 1 year in survivors of severe head injury </plain></SENT>
