<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography revealed left hemispheric hypodensity with mass effect, attributed to vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was controlled under intracranial pressure monitoring and clinical status slowly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was aphasic and right hemiplegic when she recovered consciousness but she remarkably recovered from her neurological deficits during the following two years despite neuroradiological evolution demonstrating extensive destruction of the left cortex and white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) scans were performed respectively six weeks and eight months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo>, and both demonstrated profound left hemispheric hypometabolism except in the lenticular nucleus and a restricted area of motor/premotor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the right hemisphere was heterogeneously increased on the second PET when compared with the first PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that, in this case, clinical recovery might have implicated functional reorganization arising from the intact hemisphere </plain></SENT>
