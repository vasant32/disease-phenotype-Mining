<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our experience with the use of external lumbar subarachnoid drainage in 5 children with severe diffuse head injuries is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores of 8 or less at 24 h after injury and were initially treated with ventriculostomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two children required surgical evacuation of focal mass lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 72 h of admission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children manifested high intracranial pressures (ICP) refractory to maximal therapy, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the institution of lumbar drainage, 3 of the 5 children had an abrupt and lasting decrease in ICP, obviating the need for continued <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three children survived, 2 of whom made good recoveries; 1 child is functional with disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICP varied passively with the height of the drainage bag in these surviving patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients died, most likely from uncontrolled ICP before the lumbar drain was placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that controlled external lumbar subarachnoid drainage is a potentially useful treatment for severe diffuse pediatric head injury when maximal medical therapy and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evacuation have failed to control high ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Posttraumatic CSF circulation disruption, white matter <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, and intracranial venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> can be treated with this modality in the absence of focal mass lesions </plain></SENT>
