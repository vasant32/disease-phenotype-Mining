<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a prospective cross sectional examination in a cohort of patients with IIH and matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aggregation of red blood cells in the peripheral venous blood was determined by using a slide test and image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have presently included a group of 33 women with IIH and the same number of women matched for age, body mass index, vascular risk factors and medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant (p = 0.038) increment in fibrinogen concentrations was noted in the patients (341 +/- 60.8 mg/dl) as opposed to the controls 307.9 +/- 64.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same stands for the aggregation of red blood cells (aggregation parameter of 8.7 +/- 4.9 in patients vs.5.9 +/- 3.2 in the controls, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We noted an increment in the aggregation of red blood cells in the peripheral blood of 33 women with IIH as opposed to matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Being associated with capillary slow flow, these findings might be relevant to the ethiopathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
