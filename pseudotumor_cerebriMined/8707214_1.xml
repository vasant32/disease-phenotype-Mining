<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using standard cerebral computerized tomography (CT), we diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) and correlated the CT findings with CSF pressure and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>13 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PTC were compared with 20 age-matched controls with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> or other neurologic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral CT consisted of axial sections of the posterior fossa, including the orbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects the diameter of the optic nerve sheath, reversal of the optic nerve head, presence of empty sella, and size of the ventricles, cisterns and sulci were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in basal cisterns and ventricles between those with PTC and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Empty sella was found in 6 of 13 PTC patients, compared with 1 of the 20 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Optic nerve sheath diameter in controls ranged from 3.5-5.0 mm (average 4.2 +/- 0.54 mm) but from 4.5-9.0 mm (average 6.8 +/- 1.54 mm) in those with PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reversal of the optic nerve head was seen in 4 cases of PTC but in none of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In PTC patients with opening CSF pressure greater than 270 mm water, the diameter of the optic nerve was wider than 7.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, in most cases of PTC, bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0008529'>enlarged optic nerves</z:mp> can be measured by standard cerebral CT and intracranial space-occupying lesions can be excluded as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, reversal of optic nerve head, and empty sella can frequently be seen on CT in those with PTC </plain></SENT>
