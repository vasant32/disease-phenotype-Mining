<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this clinical study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of high-dose continuous intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> in this critical care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients received a 25-34 mg/kg intravenous loading dose followed by a 1-3 mg/kg/h continuous infusion for 61-190 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dosing rates were adjusted based on the patient's clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean clearance was 0.72 ml/min/kg, with a volume of distribution (Vd) of 1.03 L/kg and a terminal half-life of 19.1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considerable variation in individual patient parameters was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a change in clearance was suggested in patients requiring a longer infusion duration </plain></SENT>
