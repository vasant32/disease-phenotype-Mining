<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chairpersons of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurology and ophthalmology departments in Israel were asked to complete questionnaires regarding patients diagnosed with PTC/IIH from 1998 through 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each questionnaire contained details regarding patient's age, sex, country of birth, age at diagnosis, weight, height, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and the results of lumbar puncture, brain computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or magnetic resonance venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-one patients with PTC/IIH were diagnosed during the years 1998 to 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five (93.4%) patients were females and six (6.6%) patients were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The calculated incidence of PTC/IIH in the Israeli general population was 0.57 to 0.94 per 100,000 persons, with incidences of 1.82 per 100,000 for women and 0.034 per 100,000 for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence for women during the childbirth years was 4.02 per 100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The female to male ratio was higher than previously reported for Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the population of Israel is a mixture of people originating from Eastern and Western countries, the incidence of PTC/IIH was found to be similar to that of Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding is an additional support to the notion that PTC/IIH is more common in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> populations </plain></SENT>
