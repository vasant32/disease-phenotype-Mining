<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of identifiable anomalies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review undertaken in a tertiary care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients seen in the outpatient otolaryngology clinic with the chief complaint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> were evaluated by physical examination and imaging including CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome measure was the incidence of identifiable abnormalities on imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were seen between January 2002 and June 2007 with the chief complaint of constant <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo>, excluding those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002668'>chemodectomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of physical examination and imaging, 14 were considered arterial, 23 venous, and 15 were indeterminate in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, sigmoid sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_68'>diverticulum</z:mpath> was the most common finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0577631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid atherosclerotic disease</z:e> was the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> of the cochlea by the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Non-vascular entities identified include superior semicircular canal dehiscence and benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
