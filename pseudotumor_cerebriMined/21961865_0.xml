<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of more than 1500 pediatric spinal surgeries performed between 1992 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From their analysis, they report on 3 adolescent patients who underwent uncomplicated segmental spinal instrumentation for pediatric spinal deformity correction and subsequently developed features of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The common variables in these 3 patients were adolescent age, spinal deformity, being overweight, symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> within 2 weeks postoperatively, significant estimated blood loss, and intraoperative use of ε-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">aminocaproic acid</z:chebi> (antifibrinolytic) injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors postulate that the development of IIH could be the result of venous outflow obstruction due to derangement of the epidural venous plexus during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of ε-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">aminocaproic acid</z:chebi> could potentially have the risk of causing IIH, probably mediated through <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo>, although there have not been published cases in the neurosurgical, orthopedic, cardiac, or general surgical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> after spinal deformity correction is a condition that should be recognized by neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons, because appropriate intervention with early medical therapy can lead to a satisfactory clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
