<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial proton <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy, T2 relaxometry and magnetization transfer ratios (MTR) were performed on three pseudotumoral demyelinating lesions to obtain information about their pathological basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline and 1-month MTR and T2 values were similar to those of cerebrospinal fluid, while spectra showed <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three-month and 1 year exams showed recovery of MTR, T2 and N-acetylaspartate, approaching the contralateral values, while <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or surpassed contralateral values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> gradually disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that pseudotumoral, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath>-like, ring-enhancing lesions may be characterized by an accumulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in the extracellular space with an almost complete <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>absence of cells</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduction of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> allows restoration of the tissue to its original location, indicating that cellular destruction was less important than was expected after the first exam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the evolution of this kind of lesion should be kept in mind when considering lesion volume from T1-weighted images as a marker of disability or irreversible cellular destruction in MS </plain></SENT>
