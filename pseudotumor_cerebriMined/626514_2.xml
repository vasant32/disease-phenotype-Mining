<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>26 children had intracranial space-occupying lesions (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, haemorrhage, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CAT was abnormal in 25 of these and diagnostic in 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A further 20 children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>, and CAT was abnormal in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast with this high rate of scans showing pathology, CAT was abnormal in only 4 of the remaining 34 children who had less definite or no intracranial disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of clinical presentation showed that 42 of 69 children presented with persisting neurological signs and of these, 25 had an intracranial space-occupying lesion and 29 had <z:mp ids='MP_0011592'>abnormal CAT</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 5 of 27 children who had symptoms alone or signs lasting less than 24 hours had <z:mp ids='MP_0011592'>abnormal CAT</z:mp>, and no intracranial lesion requiring specific treatment was missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CAT is useful for demonstrating the site, size, and nature of many lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The scan may not initially be abnormal in brain stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> and in small subdural collections of fluid </plain></SENT>
