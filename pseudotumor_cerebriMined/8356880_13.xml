<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects PI was studied during variations in paCO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 10 neurosurgical patients with head injuries concomitant measurements of PI and ICP were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed a negative exponential correlation between PI and paCO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PI changes with 3.2% pr mmHg paCO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive exponential correlation between PI and ICP was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PI changed with 2.4% pr mmHg ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of patients with raised ICP (15 mmHg &lt;) paCO2 was found not to influence the PI-reflection of the ICP, probably because paCO2-changes affected PI as well as ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the noninvasive bedside TCD-registration may be a useful marker of the ICP and probably replace the former invasive methods of measuring ICP </plain></SENT>
