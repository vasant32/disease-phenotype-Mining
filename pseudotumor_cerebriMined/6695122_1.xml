<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) are reported, there being a higher proportion of women patients and a greater frequency of those in the 3rd decade of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were principally <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (11 patients) and/or transient or permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visual disorders</z:e> (10 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral papillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was often associated with diminished visual acuity (5 cases) and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> of the visual field (5 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral venous occlusion was detected in 3 patients and an infective focus in 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients were receiving some treatment but none of the women was taking oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two were pregnant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CSF was abnormal in 5 of the 7 patients (mixed cell reaction and red blood cells: 1 case; pleiocytosis: 3 cases; raised protein levels: 1 case), and CT scans were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> except for reduced ventricular system size in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up for a mean of 1 year showed total disappearance of symptoms and signs in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Papillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> had not totally regressed at the last ophthalmological examinations performed on 5 patients, and visual sequelae (visual acuity and/or visual field anomalies) were present in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The conventional acceptance of the benign nature of BIH must be tempered by the possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of possible serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visual disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two factors appear to be determinant: the presence of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visual disorders</z:e> initially and/or the existence of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Various physiopathogenic hypotheses have been evoked to explain BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The essential mechanism appears to be an anomaly of absorption of CSF, either from increased pressure in the dural venous sinuses or lesions of the arachnoid villi, but the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and/or increased cerebral blood volume cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Incomplete understanding of physiopathogenic mechanisms account for the numerous treatments proposed and for some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> in their indications </plain></SENT>
