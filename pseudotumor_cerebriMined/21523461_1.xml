<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to investigate the potential of ultrasound-based optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurements in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) and to describe ONSD response to lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In ten patients with newly diagnosed IIH, transorbital sonography was carried out to assess ONSD, OND (optic nerve diameter), and optic disc elevation before and after lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with IIH showed a significantly enlarged ONSD on both sides (6.4 ± 0.6 mm vs. 5.4 ± 0.5 mm in controls; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The best cut-off value of ONSD for detecting raised ICP was 5.8 mm with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After lumbar puncture, ONSD decreased bilaterally (right 5.8 ± 0.7 mm, p &lt; 0.004; left 5.9 ± 0.7 mm, p &lt; 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No post-puncture changes could be observed with regard to OND and optic disc elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sonographic ONSD evaluation may be useful as an additional tool to identify patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e>, as in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data suggest a potential usefulness of this method for monitoring of treatment effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The degree of ONSD response to lumbar puncture differs in subjects with IIH, which may possibly be related to findings of a defective CSF circulation in the optic nerve sheath in this disorder, a state that is referred to as optic nerve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">compartment syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
