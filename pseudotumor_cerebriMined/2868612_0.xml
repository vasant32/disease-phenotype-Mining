<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The successful management of these cases largely depends on the prevention and treatment of secondary rises in intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only certain way of detecting such increases is with the invasive technique of intracranial pressure monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pressure module should be implanted as soon as possible, ideally, before extensive definitive surgical treatment is carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ease of usage has led us to prefer epidural pressure monitoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Being relatively easy to learn and apply, this form of monitoring should be used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hospitals involved in the treatment of severe head injury </plain></SENT>
