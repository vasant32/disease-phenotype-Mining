<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 3 groups of 4 dogs with normotensive, induced-hypotensive and induced-hypertensive blood pressure respectively, continuous expansion of an extradural supratentorial balloon led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> at inflation volumes which increased with increasing blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This positive correlation between the volume tolerance to an expanding lesion and blood pressure was also found in similar experiments on 4 hypotensive and 4 hypertensive cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monitoring cerebrospinal fluid pressures in the cerebral lateral ventricles, in the posterior fossa and in the spinal subarachnoid space showed that absolute pressures in the various compartments as well as the intercompartmental pressure gradients at the moment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> were increased in proportion to the level of the systemic arterial pressure in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations do not support current concepts that brain-stem distortion alone or that stimulation of baroreceptors in the posterior fossa are responsible for eliciting the Cushing response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fact that the supratentorial perfusion pressure was the only parameter which did not differ significantly under the different experimental conditions suggests that the mechanism responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> is local brain tissue <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, probably near the tentorial incisure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of gain in volume tolerance, when mean arterial pressure was varied from 60 mmHg to 190 mmHg, was 87% suggesting that the blood pressure may have a critical role in an intracranial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings have clinical implications </plain></SENT>
