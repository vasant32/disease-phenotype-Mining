<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Spinal catheters are often inserted for treatment of cerebrospinal fluid leaks; however, they have recently been recommended for elective cerebrospinal fluid drainage to identify patients with possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> who are most likely to respond to shunt surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rate of spinal catheter-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> with elective spinal catheter insertion is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective was to determine the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and risk factors associated with elective spinal catheter insertion for evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and microbiological data and cerebrospinal fluid results of patients admitted during 60 consecutive months who had elective spinal catheter insertion for evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> or IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 461 spinal catheters were inserted in 454 patients, including 419 (90.9%) for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and 42 (9.1%) for IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate was 3.3% (15 out of 461 patients) for the entire cohort, 3.6% (15 out of 419 patients) for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> cohort, and 0% for the IIH cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (0.2%) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate was reduced and sustained at 1.8% for 225 catheters after the topical antiseptic was changed to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="3614">chlorhexidine</z:chebi> (two-sided Fisher's exact test; P = 0.114) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is the most serious complication of spinal catheter insertion for evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> or IIH, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate can be maintained below 2% with use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="3614">chlorhexidine</z:chebi> topical antiseptic application, single-dose preprocedural antibiotic administration, and clinical surveillance of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The benefit of cerebrospinal fluid drainage via spinal catheter for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> outweighs the risks associated with the procedure </plain></SENT>
