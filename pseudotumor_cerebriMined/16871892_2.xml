<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Ventriculoatrial (VA) shunts remain a valid option for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, especially in patients in whom ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts fail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Correct positioning of the distal end of the catheter in the right atrium is of paramount importance for maintaining shunt patency and reducing the incidence of VA shunt-associated morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors present their experience with real-time transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) monitoring for the accurate placement of the distal catheter of a VA shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients underwent conversion of a VP shunt to a VA shunt under the guidance of intraoperative fluoroscopy and TEE between May 2003 and December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After induction of general anesthesia, the TEE transducer was advanced into the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cervical incision was made and the external jugular vein was visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An introducer was passed through an opening in the jugular vein and a guidewire was placed through the introducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under continuous TEE guidance, the guidewire was carefully advanced into the superior vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A distal shunt catheter overlying a J-wire was then passed to the superior vena cava, again under TEE guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The catheter was advanced to the right atrium after removing the guidewire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Final visualization with TEE and fluoroscopy revealed a good position of the catheter in the right atrium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of the operation was 91 minutes (range 65-120 minutes) and the mean operative blood loss was 23 ml (range 10-50 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No procedure-related complication was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Real-time TEE is a safe and simple technique for the accurate placement of the distal catheter of a VA shunt </plain></SENT>
