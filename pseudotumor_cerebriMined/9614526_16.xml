<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The visual function of 35 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was assessed prospectively over a 3 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In assessing the visual function of cases of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> a number of tests were employed including visual field assessment with Humphrey and Goldmann perimeters and documentation of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of visual function is the only serious complication and may occur early or late in the course of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An appropriate and sensitive clinical assessment regime is therefore of importance in the outpatient situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual field assessment was documented as the most sensitive to detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, with statistically greater sensitivity in comparison with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detection of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> indicates the necessity for visual monitoring to ensure detection of insidious <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> noted in this study were typical of anterior optic nerve pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> and commonly included arcuate defects, nasal steps and global constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>Visual loss</z:hpo> was noted at presentation and during follow-up in up to 87% of patients using Goldmann perimetry and up to 82% of patients using Humphrey perimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The visual status improved significantly throughout the follow-up period and the final visual outcome was excellent or good in 83% of patients </plain></SENT>
