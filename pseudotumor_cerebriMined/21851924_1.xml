<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective, longitudinal cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Billing records for beneficiaries 40 years of age and older enrolled in a large United States managed care network from 2001 through 2007 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence of open-angle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-tension <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, NAION, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, and IIH were determined for the beneficiaries and were stratified by <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analyses determined the hazard of each of these conditions developing among individuals with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo>, with adjustment for sociodemographic, ocular, and medical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 2 259 061 individuals in the study, 156 336 (6.9%) had 1 or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hazard of open-angle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> was no different among persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> either treated (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.18) or untreated with continuous positive airway pressure (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.05) and individuals without <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were observed when assessing the hazard of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-tension <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> developing (P &gt; .05 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significantly increased hazard of NAION developing (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.33) and IIH (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.65 to 2.49) was observed among individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> who were not receiving continuous positive airway pressure therapy as compared with individuals without <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo>, although similar increased risks could not be demonstrated among continuous positive airway pressure-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> patients for these conditions (P &gt; .05 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> are at increased risk for IIH and NAION </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should consider appropriate screening for these conditions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
