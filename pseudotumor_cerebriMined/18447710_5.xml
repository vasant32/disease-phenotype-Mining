<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the safety and accuracy of the Neurodur-P epidural sensor in the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The zero drift, as well as the medical and technical complications, of using the Neurodur-P sensor placed in the epidural space was evaluated in 106 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> of varying causes or with suspected intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median duration of ICP monitoring was 8 days (interquartile range [IQR] 6-12 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 78 (73.6%) of the 106 patients the pressure reading was recorded at sensor removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No zero drift was observed in 28 sensors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median drift was 0 mm Hg with an IQR of -1 to 1 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between patients monitored for &lt; or = 5 days and those monitored for &gt; 5 days (t = 535, p = 0.100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between zero drift and monitoring time (r = 0.153, p = 0.181) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 83 patients with a follow-up computed tomography scan, 3 showed a &lt; 1 ml collection of blood at the catheter tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275521" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clinical infections</z:e> could be attributed to the devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 1 sensor malfunctioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Continuous ICP monitoring using the Neurodur-P sensor is safe, reliable, and easy to perform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At present, using this device is the authors' standard method for the long-term monitoring of patients with alterations in complex cerebrospinal fluid dynamics or with implanted shunts </plain></SENT>
