<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A permanent elevation of ICP after severe brain injury for instance in subarachnoid or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or neurotrauma is associated with a poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although increasingly being used in the intensive care of patients with elevated ICP, continuous epidural ICP monitoring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> has not been firmly established yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the clinical course and outcome of patients with raised ICP due to space occupying ischemic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction as seen in CT, who underwent continuous ICP monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epidural ICPprobes were inserted ipsilaterally (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients) and contralaterally (additional in 7 patients) to the side of infarctation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> and Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scales (GCS and SSS) were obtained initially and in the further clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were subjected to a standardized treatment protocol for raised ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICP values were correlated with clinical presentation at the time point of deterioration, with outcome and CT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness of different treatment modalities to lower ICP were analyzed and discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 9 of 48 patients survived the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (19%), with the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> being <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e> with subsequent brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean SSS at admission was 20.6 (survivors 21.5 +/- 5.6, nonsurvivers 19.8 +/- 6.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> before the increase of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 39 patients who died developed ICP values higher than 35 mmHg and no patient with ICP values of more than 35 mmHg survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CCT changes dit not necessarily reflect the absolute measured ICP values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatment modalities for raised ICP including osmotherapy, controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, tromethamol and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> were initially effective, but only in a minority of patients ICP control could be sustained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ICP monitoring in large hemispheric infarction may predict clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>ICP monitoring was not helpful in guiding long term treatment of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It remains doubtful, whether ICP monitoring has a positive influence on clinical outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
