<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four cases of jugular bulb anunalies were reported and analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two of 4 cases were misdiognosed as jugular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_402'>glomus tumors</z:mpath>; One was considered to be jugular bulb anomaly, but was done with an enlarged operation; another one was still accompanied with benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome, was inappropriately treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The jugular bulb anomaly was often misdiagnosed, therefore the anomaly should be differentiated from the jugular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_402'>glomus tumor</z:mpath> carefully </plain></SENT>
