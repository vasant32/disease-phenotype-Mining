<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (AZA) test is a well-accepted method for measuring the vascular reactivity of the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the nature of this reactivity after long-term daily AZA treatment, the cerebral blood velocity (CBV) was measured using transcranial Doppler in patients under continuous AZA treatment after a single AZA 1 g intravenous (IV) dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients (eight women, five men) on long-term daily AZA (750 mg/day, mean treatment duration 68 +/- 12+ months) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CBV of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and the basilar artery (BA), including the values of peak velocity, mean velocity and pulsatility index (PI) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The examination was performed twice - with the initial IV administration of AZA and 20 min later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those of 10 age matched volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A consistent significant increase of CBV in the right and left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001 for both arteries) was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A highly significant decrease of peak CBV in the BA (P &lt; 0.001) was found in the post-AZA velocities of the patient's group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group, a consistent significant increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> post-AZA tests was demonstrated (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A mild elevation of blood velocity in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> concomitant with a highly significant decrease of velocity in the BA was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patterns of CBV changes indicate the presence of a '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal phenomenon</z:e>' from the posterior to the anterior circulation and stress the necessity for caution when evaluating the indications for performance of the AZA test in patients under continuous AZA therapy </plain></SENT>
