<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The shortcomings of the conventional puncture needles were compensated for by the development of a modified instrument in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study we tried to define advantages and disadvantages of percutaneous ventriculostomy with this modified needle in a large number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We treated and followed a total number of 200 patients with external ventricular drainage for various reasons (42% obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, 27% haematocephalus, 11% malresorptive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, 11% elevated ICP and 9% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ventriculostomy is performed--after percutaneous trephination with a 1.5 mm drill and 1.2 mm needle under local anaesthesia as a bedside procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The modified blunt needle is provided with markings and a set screw which allows insertion to a prefixed depth and a sharp guide which is withdrawn after penetration of the dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is then bent rostrally and fixed by a plaster cast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of drainage was 9 days (1-30 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean operating time for the whole procedure including fixation and connection to the drainage system was 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall complication rate was 13% (N = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two intracerebral haemorrhages (1%) occurred, of which one was caused by overdrainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five (3%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in primarily not infectious cases (N = 182) were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> occurred without loosening of the needle on day 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 19 patients (10%) the needles had loosened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Fifteen times this complication was repaired in time and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
