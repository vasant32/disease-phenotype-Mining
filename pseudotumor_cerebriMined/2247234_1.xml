<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study this change, we evaluated tests of sensory visual function over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the results of the right eye of 19 patients whose clinical status improved (decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> grade), and compared the outcome measures of the initial and final examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrast sensitivity testing showed significant improvement in the middle and high spatial frequency targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Snellen acuity and color tests did not change significantly over the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both Goldmann and automated visual field grade significantly improved from the initial to the final visit, while the presence of a defect on confrontation visual fields did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Numerical analyses of automated perimetry thresholds also showed significant improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Generalized loss, most pronounced on the nasal side of the visual field, was present on the initial examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Generalized improvement followed, least in the central and inferior paracentral areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with IIH should be followed with contrast sensitivity testing and perimetry using a disease-specific strategy </plain></SENT>
