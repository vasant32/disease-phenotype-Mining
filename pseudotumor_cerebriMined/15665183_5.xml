<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the differences in outcome in a group of children with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) who do not present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Differences in epidemiological and aetiological factors, clinical presentation, and visual outcome were investigated in children with a diagnosis of IIH presenting with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> to the Paediatric Neurology and Paediatric Ophthalmology Services at Guy's &amp; St Thomas' Hospitals NHS Trust between 1997 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to the 29 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, the 12 children in the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> group were younger (7.3 v 9.5 years), presented with more neurological signs (33% v 10%), and were more likely to present with severe visual failure (33% v 4%), with a tenfold increased risk of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enlarged blind spot</z:e> or field defects (50% v 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Permanent visual failure affected a third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children in the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> group, but was rare in children presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> (33% v 3%), with one patient registered blind and two severely visually impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The management of IIH is difficult in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual surveillance is vital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These children were treated with an aggressive management programme to reduce cerebrospinal fluid pressure by repeated lumbar puncture, medication, and early surgical intervention if required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive monitoring techniques might contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of IIH, improved management, and visual outcome </plain></SENT>
