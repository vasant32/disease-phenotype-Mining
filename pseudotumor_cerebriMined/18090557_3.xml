<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>-binding protein (RBP) in subjects with and without IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CSF and serum samples were collected from 87 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population was composed of subjects with IIH (IIH group, n = 28), subjects with non-IIH neurologic conditions (neurology controls, n = 42), and subjects undergoing preoperative lumbar puncture but with no known neurologic conditions (anesthesia controls, n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RBP levels (nM) were determined using radial immunodiffusion, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> levels (nM) were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>/RBP ratio was greater in CSF than in serum, especially in subjects with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The finding of increased levels of unbound <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> in the CSF of subjects with IIH provides further evidence that vitamin A may be involved in the pathogenesis of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparative statistical analyses revealed multivariate relationships that demonstrate the need to further investigate correlations between vitamin A and RBP levels in CSF and serum </plain></SENT>
