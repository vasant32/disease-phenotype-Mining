<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the experience of a multidisciplinary working group which studied this disorder focusing on the venous alterations of the dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases were studied, diagnosed, controlled and treated by our team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one of the cases, we placed a stent in the left lateral sinus with good result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients we observed various degrees of stenosis in the brain venous sinuses quantified by pressure measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, to determine the exact cause of this pathology, more studies are necessary </plain></SENT>
