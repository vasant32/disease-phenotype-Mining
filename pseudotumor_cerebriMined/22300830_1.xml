<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 1084 patients with SLE followed up from January 1997 to June 2011 in our unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified patients with IIH and analyzed the demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 1084 SLE patients, 47 underwent cerebrospinal fluid studies because of their intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and eight (17%) of these were diagnosed as IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were females aged 14 to 32 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nobody belonged to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> were the most common presenting symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had active SLE at the time of admission (SLE disease activity index â‰¥6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In eight patients, there were two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, two with anti-ribosomal P antibodies and six with anti-Ro antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects recovered without any complication after high dose steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IIH accounts for a considerable part of the causes of intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in SLE patients and steroids should be considered as a first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
