<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> on the flow velocity of the basilar artery was measured with transcranial ultrasonic Doppler in New Zealand White rabbits under alpha-chloralose anesthesia and artificial respiration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler flowmetry served to study changes of the cortical microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results confirm a high inverse correlation of the diastolic flow velocity, the pulsatility index, and the resistance index with the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, however, these parameters do not show a good correlation with the local cortical blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absence of a correlation was evident over a wide CPP range down to values of 35 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only at CPP values below this critical threshold is the microcirculation impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The threshold is reached at pulsatility index values of more than 2.0 and at resistance index values of more than 0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, transcranial Doppler indices permit the detection of critical reductions of microcirculatory blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Cushing reaction occurred with a constant time lag of 5.5 +/- 0.7 seconds after the loss of CPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Cushing reaction did not establish systolic blood flow, which remained below the functional threshold, as concluded from the temporary loss of somatosensory evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
