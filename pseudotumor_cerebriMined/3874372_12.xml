<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in regional cerebral function were found between the patients and 15 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral decompression with a lumboperitoneal shunt produced little change in regional cerebral function in one patient studied serially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The raised CSF pressure of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is therefore not associated with any significant deterioration in cerebral oxygen metabolism or hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
