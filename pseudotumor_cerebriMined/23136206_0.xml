<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the pathogenesis of IIH remains controversial, increased CSF formation may be important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that if increased CSF formation was an aetiologic factor, it might result in a macroscopic increase in size of the choroid plexus (CP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We retrospectively studied 50 patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total size of the CP was estimated on computed tomography (CT) venograms from the sum of axial areas measured at three locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with the CP load of 50 matched controls on post-contrast head CTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evans Index was measured to exclude <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were analysed using a Student's t test for independent samples (p &lt; 0.05), and the effect of ICP was tested on the dependent variable (area of CP) using regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the size of the CP glomus, total axial areas of the CP between IIH patients (183 mm(2)) and controls (178 mm(2)) and no correlation between the 'load' of CP and the degree of intracranial pressure (ICP) (R (2)&lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: If increased CSF formation is an aetiologic factor in IIH, this is not reflected in a corresponding raised 'load' of CP </plain></SENT>
