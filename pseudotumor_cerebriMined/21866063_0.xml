<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Intracranial venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is known to be associated with venous outflow obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We discuss the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical venous outflow obstruction causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report 2 patients presenting with central venous outflow obstruction secondary to osseous compression of the internal jugular veins at the craniocervical junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The point of jugular compression was between the lateral tubercle of C1 and a prominent, posteriorly located styloid process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both cases, catheter venography showed high-grade jugular stenosis at the level of C1 with an associated pressure gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dominant jugular vein was decompressed after the styloid process was resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative imaging confirmed resolution of the jugular stenosis and normalization of preoperative pressure gradients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the symptoms of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intracranial venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may result from extrinsic osseous compression of the jugular veins at the skull base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although rare, this phenomenon is important to recognize because primary stenting not only is ineffective but also may actually exacerbate the outflow obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The osseous impingement of the dominant jugular vein can be relieved via a decompressive styloidectomy, and the clinical results can be excellent </plain></SENT>
