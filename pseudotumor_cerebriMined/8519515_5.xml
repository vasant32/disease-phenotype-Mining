<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an experimental open chest model, physiopathologic effects of acutely induced, irreversible intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (AIIHT) were investigated in situ with respect to hemodynamics, cardiac pump and muscle function, and hormonal parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acutely induced irreversible intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was induced by rapid inflation of a subdural balloon catheter in 10 anesthetized dogs, four animals serving as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observation period in both groups was 300 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiocirculatory stability was maintained by continuous crystalloid volume substitution without the use of inotropic or pressor agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After AIIHT, three characteristic hemodynamic response phases have been observed: 1) The "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hyperdynamic phase" lasting up to 15 min with marked increases of heart rate (HR), left ventricular pressure (LVP), cardiac output (CO) and myocardial contractility indices, 2) At the end of the "early restabilization phase", (60 min), these parameters returned close to control levels, except HR (+50%) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (-40%), 3) During the "late restabilization phase", filling pressures, LVP and CO remained within control limits at low SVR, contractility indices showed a decreasing tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> assessed plasmatic hormones (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">Catecholamines</z:chebi>, triiodothyronine (T3), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> (T4), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and anti-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> hormone (ADH) showed a continuous fall to levels significantly below control over the phases of restabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Acutely induced irreversible intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> leads to multifactorial hemodynamic and hormonal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At low SVR, cardiac pump function was preserved exclusively by continuous volume substitution, while myocardial contractility indicated a slight decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From this observed hemodynamic and functional state within the donor organism, no reliable prediction on graft functional capacity can be made </plain></SENT>
