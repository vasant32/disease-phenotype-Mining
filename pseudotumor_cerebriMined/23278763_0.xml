<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the clinical and ophthalmological findings in a large group of patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) trying to find factors that might influence the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients with IIH were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients included were women after menarche and men older than 18 years of age who were followed up for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-two patients (89% women) with a mean age of 30.2 ± 12.0 years were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevailing complaint was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and transient visual obscurations followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>double vision</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two percent of patients were overweight at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overweight patients had higher opening cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure than patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> correlated with the CSF opening pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inverse correlation was found between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the visual field sensitivity and the grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 61.3 ± 62.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four percent of the patients have improved while in 22% CSF diversion procedures or optic nerve decompression was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean body mass index (BMI) at the end of follow-up decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven percent of the patients suffered a recurrence of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The number of recurrences inversely correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>Visual field defects</z:hpo> on presentation were encountered more frequently in patients with recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Women with recurrence had a history of more pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the strong association between overweight and IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate seemed to be influenced by the obstetrical history and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In contrast to some previous studies, we have found an interrelation between the CSF opening pressure, grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the visual field sensitivity </plain></SENT>
