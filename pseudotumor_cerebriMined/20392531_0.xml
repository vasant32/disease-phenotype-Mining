<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of consecutive patients with spontaneous defects of the temporal bone were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation, diagnostic process, exploration of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, surgical management, and outcome of patients are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of the 12 patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea</z:e> were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ages ranged from 38 to 76 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The location and the extent of the occurring defect were detected by computed tomography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiologic signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014008" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">empty sella syndrome</z:e>, indicator of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, were revealed in 3 cases using magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six tegmen defects were repaired using a middle fossa approach without recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients received the combined approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had complete resolution of the cerebrospinal fluid leak, although 2 cases developed adverse effects attributable to surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea</z:e> requires clinical suspicion in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and persistent serous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>High-resolution computed tomography can confirm the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The authors' findings advocate the multilayered closure technique through a middle fossa approach </plain></SENT>
