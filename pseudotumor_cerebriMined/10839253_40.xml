<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The goal of this study was to assess the value of the Codman Hakim programmable valve to settings in the range of 30 to 200 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This valve can be adjusted noninvasively for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors conducted a single-center retrospective study of 583 patients (421 adults and 162 children) suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> of various causes (379 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal-pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (174 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cyst</z:hpo> (14 patients), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (16 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases a Codman Hakim programmable valve was implanted; in 82.8% of cases it was included during the patient's first shunt implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 42.4% of the cases valve pressure adjustment was required at least once (mean number of adjustments 1.2, maximum 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' clinical status improved after 64.6% of pressure adjustments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accidental resetting of opening pressure, other than that caused by magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging, was uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging caused resetting in 26.8% of cases in which it was used, it was deemed mandatory to obtain an x-ray film after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Valve malfunction, blockage, or adjustment difficulties occurred in 2% of valves implanted, and nontraumatic subdural fluid collections were demonstrated in 5.1% of patients (13 of whom were treated by valve pressure adjustment alone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five-year shunt survival was 53.1% for first-time shunt implantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1141920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">shunt infection</z:e> rate was 8.5% of valve implantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Catheter-related complications and shunt-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were the main reasons for surgical revision and the major cause of shunt failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At follow-up review, 97% of children and 90% of adults had improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because one cannot know in advance which case will turn out to be complicated, the authors' preference is to use the Codman Hakim programmable valve for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conditions in which CSF should be drained </plain></SENT>
