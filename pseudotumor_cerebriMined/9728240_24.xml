<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Firstly, 14 patients are described who developed either an acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> (ACM) alone (7 cases) or ACM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> (7 cases) after lumbar subarachnoid space (SAS) shunting or in one case, epidural anaesthesia with SAS penetration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four groups are considered: 3 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (CH), 4 cases with CH alone, 3 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumour cerebri</z:e> (PTC) and a miscellaneous group (4 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial treatment was varied: resiting the shunt to ventricle or cisterna magna [6], adding an H-V valve [1], syrinx shunting [4] and posterior fossa decompression [3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further treatment was required in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondly, incidence was examined in 87 patients with PTC initially treated either by lumbar SAS shunting [70] or cisterna magna shunting [17] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first sub-group, 11 cases (15.7 per cent) developed an ACM, 3 symptomatic (as above) and eight asymptomatic with 1 case also having <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> whereas 1 case occurred in the second group with a questionanably symptomatic ACM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While accurate for symptomatic lesions, these figures are tentative with respect to asymptomatic lesions due to inadequate pre-treatment radiology and detailed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main conclusions are, first, that the incidence of symptomatic ACM and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> is not high enough to warrant abandoning SAS shunting; second that asymptomatic lesions need not necessarily be treated and third, that when treatment is required, shunt resiting is the first choice </plain></SENT>
