<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>13 operations were performed on 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 8 transcranial operations, an assumed defect in the anterior fossa was plugged with muscle, but only 3 operations were successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 4 operations, either transcranial or transsphenoidal, the sella was packed with muscle and rhinorrhea ceased immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on radiological and operative findings, 3 groups of patients appeared (1) 9 patients had pathology related to the pituitary gland or the sella turcica: enlarged sella, empty sella, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032019" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pituitary tumour</z:e>, intrasellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> of the sellar osseous border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) 2 patients had rhinorrhea from extrasellar origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) In 4 patients no abnormality could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prior to the rhinorrhea, 6 patients (5 from group 1 and 1 from group 3) had experienced episodes of neurological symptoms, compatible with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032001" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pituitary apoplexy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that non-traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea</z:e> in most cases is the result of a spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002893'>pituitary adenoma</z:hpo>, which has caused sellar bony <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
