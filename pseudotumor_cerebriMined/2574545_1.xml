<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were assigned to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45652">suxamethonium</z:chebi> 1.0 mg/kg, atracurium 0.6 mg/kg, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9939">vecuronium</z:chebi> 0.2 mg/kg, or saline placebo intravenously at three conditions: First, with the epidural balloon deflated Po, next at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>, then at Pmax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither atracurium, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9939">vecuronium</z:chebi>, nor placebo produced any statistically significant effect on HR, BP, ICP, or CPP at any baseline level of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45652">Suxamethonium</z:chebi> produced an early fall in ICP (0.8 +/- 0.3, 2.6 +/- 1.0 and 3.5 +/- 1.3 mmHg at Po, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> and Pmax respectively: P = .0005) followed by a rapid rise above the pre-infusion level (1.8 +/- 0.6, 2.8 +/- 0.6 mmHg, and 2.2 +/- 0.5 mmHg at Po, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> and Pmax respectively: P = .0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A fall in BP coupled with the rise in ICP resulted in a fall in CPP (5.8 +/- 2.3, 6.1 +/- 1.2, and 6.3 +/- 1.8 mmHg at Po, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> and Pmax respectively: P = .0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the fall in CPP was not large, in the presence of elevated ICP, where CPP already is marginal, such a decrease may compromise cerebral blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
