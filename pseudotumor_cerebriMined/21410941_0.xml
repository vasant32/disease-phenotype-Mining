<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We present a case of ciprofloxacin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> in a 22-year-old African American woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Withdrawal of ciprofloxacin in our patient resulted in complete resolution of ciprofloxacin-associated pseudotumor, as evidenced by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuro-ophthalmic examination and a cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure of 140 mmH20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old African American woman presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of two weeks duration, visual blurring and horizontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> after starting ciprofloxacin for <z:mp ids='MP_0011403'>pyelonephritis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An ophthalmic examination revealed that she had left eye <z:hpo ids='HP_0000565'>esotropia</z:hpo>, and a picture of the fundus demonstrated bilateral disc swelling without spontaneous venous pulsations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a magnetic resonance venogram were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A diagnostic lumbar puncture demonstrated an elevated opening pressure of 380mmH2O in a supine position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laboratory examinations, including a cerebrospinal fluid exam, were unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ciprofloxacin-associated pseudotumor can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and visual complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapy is sub-optimal, often symptomatic, insufficient and complicated by side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When ciprofloxacin-associated pseudotumor presents in an atypical population, an inciting agent must be suspected because prompt withdrawal of the agent may lead to complete resolution of symptoms and prevent recurrence of similar episodes </plain></SENT>
