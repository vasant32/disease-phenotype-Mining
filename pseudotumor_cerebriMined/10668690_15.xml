<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and to measure quality of life in women with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), a matched group cross-sectional study was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Women with IIH (n = 28) were compared with control groups of weight- and age-matched women not diagnosed with IIH (n = 30) and with age-matched women of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-eight women completed a questionnaire soliciting health information and standardized questionnaires measuring <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The groups were compared using analysis of variance and chi2 tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Where appropriate, post hoc comparisons were made using Fisher's test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with IIH reported a greater number of adverse health problems than either of the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-health-related psychosocial concerns were equally prevalent among the three groups, but IIH patients were significantly more affected by hardships associated with health problems than the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient group also had higher levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> than the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These adverse health conditions were reflected in decreased quality of life measures for the IIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study supports previous reports that link <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and psychosocial difficulties, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> alone is not the explanation for the higher levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and lower levels of quality of life </plain></SENT>
