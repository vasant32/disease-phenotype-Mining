<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) administered on an intermittent oral schedule with interferon-alpha2a (IFN-alpha2a) in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677936" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">refractory cancer</z:e>, and whether the marked reduction in plasma ATRA concentrations observed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily oral dosing could be circumvented with an intermittent dosing schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677936" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">refractory cancer</z:e> (stratified by age, &lt; or = 12 and &gt; 12 years) were treated with ATRA 3 consecutive days per week and IFN-alpha2a 3 x 10(6) U/m2 5 consecutive days per week, both repeated weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The starting dose of ATRA was 60 mg/m2/d divided into three doses, with planned escalations to 90 and 120 mg/m2/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> have been noted to occur on the initial day of ATRA administration, only two of three doses of ATRA were administered on day 1 of each week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> or dose-limiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was observed in two of five patients older than 12 years treated at the 120-mg/m2/d dose level and in one of six &lt; or = 12 years at the 90-mg/m2/d level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other non-dose-limiting toxicities of ATRA included reversible elevations in hepatic transaminases and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000958'>dry skin</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100825'>cheilitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One child with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> had an objective response of 6 months' duration, and one with recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> had histologic maturation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260037" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This intermittent schedule allowed for exposure to relatively high plasma concentrations of ATRA on a repetitive basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following 30-mg/m2 doses, the ATRA area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) decreased from 96 +/- 14 micromol/L/min on day 1 to 26 +/- 24 micromol/L/min by day 3 of drug administration, but on day 1 of the fourth consecutive week of therapy, the AUC averaged 110 +/- 16 micromol/L/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recommended pediatric phase II dose of ATRA administered on this schedule is 90 mg/m2/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An intermittent schedule of ATRA administration appears to circumvent the low plasma drug exposure that is a result of the sustained upregulation of metabolism when this drug is administered on a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of this trial, a phase II trial of ATRA/IFN-alpha2a in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> using this schedule is in progress </plain></SENT>
