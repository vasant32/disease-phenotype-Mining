<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Up to now, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> is suspected by clinical and neuroimaging findings, but its verification depends on invasive techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on our experimental findings of rapid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of human optic nerve sheaths (ONS), we investigated whether this phenomenon not only happens under <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, but also under <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> conditions of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using optic nerve sonography the ONS was measured at 3 mm behind the papilla in axial transbulbar view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine children admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 24 were being treated for elevated ICP (head trauma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorder</z:e>) and were compared to control patients (outpatients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ONS diameter (ONSD) found in ICU patients with elevated ICP ranged up to 6.8 mm and was significantly enlarged compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> data (Wilcoxon's test, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ONSD of ICU patients without pressure elevation was in the same range as that of control patients (2.7-4.0 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Considering the error of measurement (0.35 mm), the ONSD is regarded as definitely enlarged when 5 mm is exceeded in children above age 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In younger children, smaller ONSD have to be taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ultrasound studies of the optic nerve may contribute information about the acutely increased ICP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
