<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of ventricular expansion steered the focus away from CSF homeostasis in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to measure intracranial CSF volumes and cerebral venous drainage with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging to determine whether increased CSF volume from impaired CSF homeostasis and venous hemodynamics occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two homogeneous cohorts of 11 newly diagnosed pretreatment overweight women with IIH and 11 overweight healthy women were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3D volumetric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the brain was used to quantify CSF and brain tissue volumes, and dynamic phase contrast was used to measure relative cerebral drainage through the internal jugular veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Findings confirm <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ventricular volume in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, extraventricular CSF volume is significantly increased in IIH (290 ± 52 versus 220 ± 24 mL, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is even more significant after normalization with intracranial volume (P = .0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GM interstitial fluid volume is also increased in IIH (602 ± 57 versus 557 ± 31 mL, P = .037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total arterial inflow is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but relative venous drainage through the IJV is significantly reduced in IIH (65 ± 7% versus 81 ± 10%, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased intracranial CSF volume that accumulates in the extraventricular subarachnoid space provides direct evidence for impaired CSF homeostasis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The finding of larger GM interstitial fluid volume is consistent with increased overall resistance to cerebral venous drainage, as evident from reduced relative cerebral drainage through the IJV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present study confirms that both impaired CSF homeostasis and venous hemodynamics coexist in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated IIH </plain></SENT>
