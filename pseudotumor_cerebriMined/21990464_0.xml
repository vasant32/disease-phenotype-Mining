<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The imaging findings of transverse sinus stenosis in two patients with PTCS using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) before and after endovascular therapy with stent placement are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective, two patient, technical note </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both cases IVUS demonstrated focal intraluminal filling defects within the transverse sinuses, resulting in a narrowing of the sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first case, IVUS demonstrated cannulation of a narrow channel within the transverse sinus that initially precluded advancement of the stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second case, IVUS demonstrated a significant narrowing when the pressure gradient was borderline and the area of stenosis was not obvious at angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Besides distinguishing a potential extrinsic compression phenomenon from an intrinsic abnormality as the cause of the transverse sinus stenosis, IVUS also shows great promise as a tool helping to plan the interventional procedure and achieve optimal stent positioning in patients with PTCS </plain></SENT>
