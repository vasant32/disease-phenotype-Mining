<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is a passive event not primarily affecting the visual tract, resolution with restitution ad integrum is expected if intracranial pressure is rebalanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber swelling due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and possible axon loss after long-lasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> was investigated in a controlled cross-sectional study by scanning laser polarimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 23 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> according to the modified Dandy diagnostic criteria, and 23 controls matched for age and gender were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received neurological and ophthalmologic examination including scanning laser polarimetry (GDx VCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into groups depending on the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (group 1) or the regression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> after initiation of therapy (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy was based on recommendations of the German Society of Neurology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Scanning laser polarimetry showed an increase of nerve fiber thickness in group 1, and a decrease of the nerve fiber thickness in group 2 compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten of 13 patients showed signs of a regional axon loss in the deviation map of the GDx report, and six had a Nerve Fiber Index above 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with regressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and coincidence of visual field damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000543'>pale optic disc</z:hpo> appearance had a pathologic result in the GDx examination, but only four of ten patients with a pathologic GDx examination showed coincidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000543'>pale optic disc</z:hpo> appearance and visual field damage as sign of underlying optic disc <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with apparently effective treatment of clinical symptoms and a regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, a <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> axon loss was detected by scanning laser polarimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Axon loss was even present in patients without clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic nerve atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
