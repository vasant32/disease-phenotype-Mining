<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Between January 1, 1970, and June 30, 1995, 113 patients with a clinical diagnosis of SLE were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 33 had ocular motor abnormalities and a diagnosis of SLE as defined by the revised criteria of the American College of Rheumatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Patients hospitalized on the wards of the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, Los Angeles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Thirty-three patients, 82% women, ranging in age from 19 to 58 years (mean, 33.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average duration of SLE was 3.5 years, and 10 patients had been symptomatic for 5 years or longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 55 ocular motor signs, 33 involved limitation of eye movements or abnormal eye position at rest; abnormal spontaneous eye movements occurred 12 times; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> was seen in eight patients and psychogenic signs in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (48%) had brain-stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; 11 had other known causes, including three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020701" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hysteria</z:e>, and one each with ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, both ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018378" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Guillain-Barr√© syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperosmolality</z:e>, and hypoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four patients with isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sixth nerve palsies</z:e> and two with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo>, the cause remained unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ocular motor signs in SLE are uncommon and often transitory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When present, they help to ascertain the location, and often the cause, of neurologic involvement </plain></SENT>
