<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic criteria should include the evaluation of possibly disturbed cerebral venous outflow, which may result in similar clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disturbed venous drainage should be separated from the syndrome of PTC because it represents a condition of well-defined origin and therapeutic regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Course and prognosis of PTC are not related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, or to the duration of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234387" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> are rare, indicating that brain tissue is not primarily affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, computerized tomography (CT) scans with respect to the cerebrum are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in about 90% of the cases; but <z:mp ids='MP_0008529'>enlarged optic nerve</z:mp> sheaths (46.7%) and empty sella (45.7%) are frequent findings on CT-scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They most likely represent a direct consequence of long-term increased pressure within CSF spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation favors the assumption of disturbed CSF-pressure regulation either by increased production of CSF or its decreased rate of absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> (slit ventricles) as assessed by CT is a rare finding (11.4% of our cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may be a hint towards a different pathogenetic entity </plain></SENT>
