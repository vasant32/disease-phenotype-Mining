<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean flow velocity (FV) in the basal cerebral arteries commonly decreased on the side of the haematoma depending on intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) reduction in focal brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The FV decreased bilaterally and there was no difference between the right and left sides in diffuse brain injury without a clear relationship between the FV and CPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The FV of the middle cerebral artery and blood flow in the internal carotid artery exhibited flow patterns which changed correlatively depending on CPP reduction in experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monitoring with TCD ultrasound is valuable in evaluating compression <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in focal brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But many complicated factors are considerable in diffuse brain injury </plain></SENT>
