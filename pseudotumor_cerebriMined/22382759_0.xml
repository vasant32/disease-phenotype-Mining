<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Data from two recent studies strongly support the hypothesis that idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (IIHWOP) could represent a powerful risk factor for the progression of pain in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first study highlights that an asymptomatic IIHWOP is much more prevalent than believed in the general population and occurs only in central venous stenosis carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the second study, about one half of a large consecutive series of unresponsive primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> patients shows significant sinus venous stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A continuous or intermittent IIHWOP was detectable in 91% of this subgroup and in no patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, after the lumbar puncture, a 2- to 4-week improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> frequency was observed in most of the intracranial hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggest that patients prone to primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> who carry central venous outflow abnormalities are at high risk of developing a comorbid IIHWOP, which in turn is responsible for the progression and the unresponsiveness of the pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the available literature data, we propose that central sinus stenosis-related IIHWOP, although highly prevalent among otherwise healthy people, represents an important modifiable risk factor for the progression and refractoriness of pain in patients predisposed to primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mechanism could refer to up to one half of the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> patients with minimal response to treatments referring to specialized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Due to the clinical and taxonomic relevance of this hypothesis further studies are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
