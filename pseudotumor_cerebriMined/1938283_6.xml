<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine its test-retest variability, we studied 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and 10 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) by testing both eyes four separate times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no increase in variability from the center out to 21 degrees of visual field eccentricity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant increase from 22 degrees to 29 degrees in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and IIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike light sensitivity threshold automated perimetry, with an increase in threshold level there was no significant increase in variability in either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> or patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may be because of the test's method, which thresholds by target size rather than intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As expected, there was a large intersubject variability in the patients, with the visual fields being significantly disturbed by analysis of total field, quadrants, concentric rings, and anatomic nerve fiber bundle regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in the total within subject variability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because with the ring test there is no increase in variability with an increase in threshold, this method of perimetry may have great utility for following patients with disturbed visual fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ring test appears to have advantages that promote low test-retest variability </plain></SENT>
