<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The modified Dandy criteria consist of, the classic findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, however, these are rarely collectively present in any one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these findings can wax and wane over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to the nature of this disease, both signs and symptoms may be intermittent, making definitive diagnosis difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Newer imaging studies, particularly the magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) along with a constellation of correlative findings and associated diseases have given new impetus in the diagnosis, treatment, and pathophysiology of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This has led the authors to offer modifications to the classic Dandy criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report presents three representative cases of BIH highlighting many of the newer advances in both diagnosis and treatment of this perplexing disorder </plain></SENT>
