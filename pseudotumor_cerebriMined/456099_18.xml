<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The commonest initial CT diagnosis was of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This swelling was associated with an increased white matter density on the CT scan which decreased to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> concomitant with recovery and increased ventricular size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF measurements in 6 of these patients revealed an increased blood flow despite a decreased CMRO2 and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This CT pattern of diffuse swelling is believed to be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> and hyperemia and not to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of this, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children were treated with endotracheal intubation and controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> as part of the initial management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mass lesions were uncommon, 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ICP was monitored in 40 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ICP rose above 20 Torr despite therapy in 80% of children with decerebrate or flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and in only 20% of children with spontaneous motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ICP was at its highest between the second and fifth day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aggressive therapy to control the ICP, with <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> if necessary, was successful in 80% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall results were useful recovery in 87.5% of the children, 3.5% were left vegetative or severely disabled and 9% died </plain></SENT>
