<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For accurate assessment of cardiac function and intravascular volume, determinations were made by a dye dilution technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This approach was used in 68 patients, in whom 215 dye dilution measurements were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Useful parameters of left ventricle function included cardiac output, cardiac index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume, and mixing time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Important measures for the assessment of intravascular volume were mixing volume, dispersion volume, total peripheral resistance, central venous pressure, and mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary monitoring by this dye dilution technique has proved useful, relatively noninvasive, rapid, and easily repeatable in a wide variety of clinical situations in which cardiac function and state of hydration require accurate assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By adding this dye dilution technique to the more commonly used methods for evaluating intravascular volume and cardiac function, more accurate monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> neurosurgical patients can be carried out </plain></SENT>
