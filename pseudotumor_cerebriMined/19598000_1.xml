<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although CSF was believed to be homogenous in content, a previous study has showed that a marked concentration gradient of L-PGDS exists between the spinal CSF and the CSF in the subarachnoid space of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029132" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">optic nerve disease</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-tension <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of axon function in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and specifically in the optic nerve, and we therefore investigated the biochemical effects of L-PGDS on the proliferation of astrocytes and on the production of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) by astrocyte mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found an inhibitory effect of L-PGDS on both proliferation of astrocytes and production of astrocyte ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations that inhibited astrocyte proliferation and ATP production were in the range measured in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-tension <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the CSF is in contact with axons and mitochondria of the optic nerve (Bristow et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Archives of Ophthalmology, 120, 791-796, 2002), we postulate that a change in the concentration of CSF protein such as L-PGDS could exercise a harmful effect on these structures </plain></SENT>
