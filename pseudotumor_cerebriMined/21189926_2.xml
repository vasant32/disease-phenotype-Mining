<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the spring of 2009, HFMD was epidemic in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Severe cases with complication, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, have been reported and it has become a public health issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most symptomatic EV71 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> commonly result in HFMD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019338" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpangina</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These clinical manifestations can be associated with neurologic syndromes frequently </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Examinations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> 71 were performed from the stools, respiratory secretion or CSF of the children by realtime PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene analysis showed that most of them were caused by EV71 subgenotype C4a which was prevalent in China, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Public health measures including personal and environmental hygiene, must to target daycare centers, kindergartens, and schools where highly susceptible children congregate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To prevent the spread of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, preschools where transmission persists for more than 2 incubation periods, have been recommended for closure, and trigger criteria for voluntary closure was instituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During closure, operators are to thoroughly clean the centers before they are allowed to reopen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, parents are advised to ensure that their children adopt a high standard of personal hygiene and to keep the infected child at home until full recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because the outbreaks occur in a cyclical pattern, surveillance system to predict next outbreaks and adequate public health measures to control need to be planned for future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Control of EV71 epidemics through surveillance and public health intervention needs to be maintained in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future research should focus on understanding of EV71 virulence, identification of the receptor(s) for EV71, development of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="22587">antiviral agents</z:chebi> and development of vaccine </plain></SENT>
