<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is uncommon in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, there have been reports that children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> impairment of renal function may be at greater risk of developing BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study involved retrospective case note analysis of children undergoing renal transplantation over the last 11 years at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine children developed BIH after renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the condition in our series was 4.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several etiologically relevant risk factors were identified, including medication (nitrofurantoin, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>) and excess <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that BIH may be a more frequent complication of the post-operative care of pediatric renal transplant recipients than previously thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hope to alert pediatric nephrologists that examination of the fundus for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> renal transplant patients complaining of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If the diagnosis of BIH is delayed, irretrievable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> may not be avoided </plain></SENT>
