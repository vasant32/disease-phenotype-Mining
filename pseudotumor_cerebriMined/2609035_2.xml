<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous overnight recordings of intracranial pressure (ICP) and electroencephalography (EEG) were conducted on 85 neurosurgical patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure waves were classified into five types according to the pattern of appearance, and their correlation with sleep cycles and clinical conditions of patients were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A-waves appeared exclusively in patients with long-standing intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and episodic B-waves appeared in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> or a postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When these episodic pressure waves appeared, the patients were conscious and sleep cycles including REM stage were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persistent, high pressure B-waves were seen mostly in patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The consciousness of these patients ranged from drowsy to stupor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EEG showed alternate appearances of light sleep and waking rhythms in accordance with cyclic oscillations of B-waves which coincided with periodic, apneic respiratory rhythms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When markedly regular B-waves of moderately high pressure appeared continuously, the patients were severely impaired in consciousness and were mainly in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EEG showed continuous slow activities and sleep stages were not scored in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No characteristic clinical features were found in patients whose ICP remained within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range without pressure waves throughout the recording </plain></SENT>
