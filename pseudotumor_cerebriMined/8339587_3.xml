<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: An animal laboratory of a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four sequential global and regional cerebral blood flow determinations were made in each animal during monitoring of heart rate and systemic arterial pressure, during respiratory control and arterial blood gas monitoring, intracranial pressure monitoring, and with or without inflation of an epidural balloon catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> mongrel dogs obtained from the Baylor Center for Comparative Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five groups of animals were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 1, the response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> was assessed in dogs without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group 2, the response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> was assessed in animals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group 3, the response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> plus <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy was assessed in dogs without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group 4, the response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> plus <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy was assessed in dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group 5, a group of dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> was treated with neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> nor <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>Hyperventilation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> plus <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy, or no interventions were studied in these experimental paradigms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome measures were changes in intracranial pressure and/or changes in regional or total cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow rate was produced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> alone in groups with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy resulted in a significant further decrease in cerebral blood flow rate in animals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, but no greater decrease in intracranial pressure was seen compared with treatment with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion pressures remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> despite significant decreases in cerebral blood flow rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> administration in this model of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was no more effective in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
