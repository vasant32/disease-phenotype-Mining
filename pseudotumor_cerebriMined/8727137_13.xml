<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first part of the study, CBF was intraoperatively measured (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi> anesthesia) during relative <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> in 95 patients before and after resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NPPB group had a greater increase (P &lt; 0.0001) in mean +/- standard deviation global CBF (28 +/- 6 to 47 +/- 16 ml/100 g/min, n = 5) than did the non-NPPB group (25 +/- 7 to 29 +/- 10 ml/100 g/min, n = 90); both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> groups showed greater increase (P &lt; 0.05) than did controls undergoing craniotomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (23 +/- 6 to 23 +/- 6 ml/100 g/min, n = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral and contralateral CBF changes were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, CBF was measured at relative normocapnia and it increased (P &lt; 0.002) from pre- to postresection (40 +/- 13 to 49 +/- 15 ml/100 g/min, n = 57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no NPPB patients in this latter cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The feeding mean arterial pressure was measured intraoperatively before resection or at the last embolization before surgery (n = 64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The feeding mean arterial pressure (44 +/- 16 mm Hg) was 56% of the systemic arterial pressure (78 +/- 12 mm Hg, P &lt; 0.0001) and was not related to changes in CBF from pre- to postresection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was an association between increases in global CBF from pre- to postresection and NPPB-type complications, but there was no relationship of these CBF changes to preoperative regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>arterial hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data do not support a uniquely hemodynamic mechanism that explains cerebral hyperemia as a consequence of repressurization in hypotensive vascular beds </plain></SENT>
