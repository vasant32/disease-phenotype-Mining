<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following investigation a high degree of intra cranial pressure was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several years ago a similar finding was diagnosed, and the disease was brought into remission by the administration of periodical pulses of high dose intravenous immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) is an uncommon presentation of neuro-psychiatric SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this patient several risk factors of BIH (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, steroid therapy, and SLE) assembled and elicited a severe presentation of the disorder which became more resistant to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several pathogenic pathways tie BIH with SLE as thrombotic obliteration of cerebral arteriolar and venous systems and immune complex deposition within the arachnoid villi (that are responsible for CSF absorption) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As shown in this care report of BIH, clinical findings do not always parallel various imaging techniques as MRI and CT brain scans </plain></SENT>
