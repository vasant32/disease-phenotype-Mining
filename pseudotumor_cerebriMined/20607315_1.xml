<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lumboperitoneal shunts (LPS) have long been used for treating idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and other types of "communicating" <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although they can provide rapid and effective symptom resolution, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) over-drainage remains a common complication of LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We introduce the use of the Miethke DualSwitch Valve (M-DSV) for LPS and describe our preliminary experience with these valves in managing and avoiding CSF over-drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first description of the use of M-DSV for LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over 6 months, we treated five patients with LPS using M-DSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prior to the use of the M-DSV, four patients experienced significant over-drainage symptoms secondary to LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data was collected prospectively, including preoperative details and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients (age range, 22 to 71 years) were operated upon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, one patient had an LPS for treatment of a posterior fossa <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270687" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudomeningocele</z:e>, and one had an LPS for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392548" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cauda equina syndrome</z:e> secondary to lumbar <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients had a history of clinical over-drainage secondary to pre-existing LPS systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The fifth patient had an LPS revision after the previous LPS migrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 5 to 11 months (mean, 7.8 ± 3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a good outcome with immediate resolution of over-drainage symptoms and are currently asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of M-DSV in LPS is an effective alternative for avoiding posture-related over-drainage and managing patients with LPS-related over-drainage symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further experience is required to address the long-term outcome, balancing sufficient drainage while preventing over-drainage </plain></SENT>
