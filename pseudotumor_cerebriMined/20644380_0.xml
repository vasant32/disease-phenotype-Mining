<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During exercise, regional cerebral blood flow may be elevated in particular areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case report presents the impact of aerobic exercise on intracranially measured pressure and brain tissue oxygenation in an adult human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINCIAL PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old man with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> treated with cerebrospinal fluid diversion was monitored with a Licox intracranial brain oxygen and pressure monitor (Integra NeuroSciences Corporation, Plainsboro, New Jersey) for refractory nonpostural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> exacerbated after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He performed trials of running and bicycling to provoke his <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's mean intracranial pressure remained stable during exercise despite elevated cerebral perfusion pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral oxygen tension levels were strictly regulated to a level of approximately 39 mm Hg during steady state aerobic exercise, with transient increases up to 90 mm Hg at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and termination of activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that cerebral autoregulation appears to maintain constant cerebral oxygen tension during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, we note transient cerebral hyperoxygenation at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of exercise as autoregulation "turns on" and at the termination of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We present a quantitative interpretation of the post-exercise hyperoxygenation phase based on Fick's principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We are the first to demonstrate cortical hyperoxygenation in a human breathing natural air without oxygen supplementation </plain></SENT>
