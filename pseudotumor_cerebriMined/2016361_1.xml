<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, reports that Xe causes cerebrovascular dilation and increases intracranial pressure (ICP) have tempered enthusiasm for its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of 5 min of 33% Xe inhalation on ICP (right and left hemispheres) were studied in eight fentanyl-anesthetized Rhesus monkeys after right-sided cortical freeze injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICP, CBF, and physiological variables were monitored for up to 6 h postinsult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preinjury (control) right hemispheric ICP was 8 +/- 5 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) and left hemispheric ICP was 5 +/- 2 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postinjury observations were classified into low (less than 15 mm Hg) and high ICP (greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both right and left ICP values averaged 9 +/- 3 mm Hg in the low ICP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the high ICP group, the right ICP was 20 +/- 4 mm Hg and left ICP was 21 +/- 6 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICP was unchanged by Xe inhalation under control conditions as well as in both low and high ICP groups postinjury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postinjury, the MABP decreased 10-15 mm Hg in the low ICP group and 10-17 mm Hg in the high ICP group 2-3 min after the start of Xe inhalation (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results show that 33% Xe inhalation does not increase ICP in fentanyl-anesthetized monkeys but could decrease MABP in stressed states, presumably because of the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> effects of Xe </plain></SENT>
