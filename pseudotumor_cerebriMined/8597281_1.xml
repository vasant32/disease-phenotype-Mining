<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, who were unresponsive to medical treatment, underwent optic nerve sheath fenestration after administration of topical and subtenon's local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When topical tetracaine, in conjunction with subtenon's anesthesia, was administered at the beginning of the procedure, excellent anesthesia and maximal patient comfort were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of local anesthesia allows for a pain-free, expeditious operation with fewer potential <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> complications </plain></SENT>
