<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: It is the aim of this paper to explore how efficient measures of quality of life and hope might be used to assess clinical progress for patients with disorders of cerebrospinal fluid circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It will be argued that a single-item 10-point quality of life scale and the Herth Hope Index are as effective at measuring progress as the more widely used, but considerably more complex, Short-Form 36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients attending a cerebrospinal fluid clinic were sent a questionnaire containing the three measures of progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires were returned in a stamp-addressed envelope to allow initial analysis before the clinic appointment and to enable discussion of results during the clinic appointment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were also assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination during the clinic appointment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The relationship between the three measures of progress was calculated using Spearman's rank order correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlations of 0.40-0.70 are considered modest and correlations of 0.70 are considered strong; 5% levels of significance are considered significant and 1% levels are highly significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Internal consistency of the Short-Form 36 was assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reliability was considered acceptable for dimension comparisons when alpha &gt; 0.70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were diagnosed with benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n = 74), congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (n = 35) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (n = 171) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a modest to strong correlation between the quality of life-10 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight dimensions of the Short-Form 36 for benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A slightly weaker correlation was demonstrated in seven of the eight Short-Form 36 dimensions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>Normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> patients scored significantly lower on the Mini-Mental State Examination, which may contribute to explaining the weaker correlation between the three measures and the weaker internal consistency between the dimensions with the Short-Form 36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This paper demonstrates that efficient indicators of progress (quality of life-10 and Herth Hope Index) can be as effective at assessing clinical progress as more complex indicators (Short-Form 36) in patients who do not demonstrate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: For clinical application, the Short-Form 36 is too long, difficult to complete, score and analyse for these patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Quality of life-10 and Herth Hope Index could provide efficient and effective measures of clinical progress but this requires further psychometric examination </plain></SENT>
