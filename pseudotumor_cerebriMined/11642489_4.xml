<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We chose to compare histologically and ultrastructurally changes in the optic nerve sheath after optic nerve sheath decompression, initially after a second surgery and after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin-C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which optic nerve sheath decompression alleviates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> can be further understood in consideration of the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue was obtained by biopsy from 3 first-time surgical and 4 reoperative cases with and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin-C</z:chebi> in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sheaths were fixed in a mixture of 2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi> and 2% glutaraldehyde, osmicated and dehydrated in a series of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, and finally embedded in epon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue blocks were sectioned at 1 microm and stained with both <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> and toluidine blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thin sections were examined by transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> meningeal tissue obtained at the time at optic nerve sheath decompression consisted mainly of collagen, closely packed and roughly parallel to the axis of the optic nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collagen deposition seen in scar tissue after secondary optic nerve sheath decompression was extremely disorganized and irregular, with the individual fibers laid down seemingly at random </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was little sense of layering or of parallel arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">Mitomycin-C</z:chebi> appeared to influence collagen deposition in such a way that the collagen was more regularly packed and more closely resembled unoperated tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The regular well-organized collagen packing seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sheath tissue is disrupted and replaced by less organized but compact scar tissue after optic nerve sheath decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25357">mitomycin</z:chebi> use, more regular collagen packing closely approximating that found in unoperated sheath occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This configuration of fibers lends support for the filtration mechanism of optic nerve sheath decompression in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
