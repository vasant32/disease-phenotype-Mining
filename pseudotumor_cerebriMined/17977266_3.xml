<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Findings in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010953'>noncommunicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo> have suggested that a reduction in compliance of the superior sagittal sinus, an elevation in venous outflow pressure, and the development of venous collateral flow may be associated with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although elevated venous pressure is known to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in children, this mechanism has fallen out of favor as a theory in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002410'>aqueductal stenosis</z:hpo> (LIAS) underwent magnetic resonance imaging with flow quantification measuring the degree of ventricular enlargement, sulcal compression, total blood inflow, superior sagittal/straight sinus outflow, aqueduct flow, arteriovenous delay (AVD), and the extent of collateral venous flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data obtained in these patients were compared with those obtained in 21 age-matched control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a reduction in compliance in the patients with LIAS in whom the AVD decreased by 50% (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The arterial inflow and the straight sinus outflow were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but the sagittal sinus outflow was reduced by 23% (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This indicated that significant collateral venous outflow pathways were draining blood away from the superficial but not the deep drainage system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Similar to the animal models, patients with LIAS exhibit a reduced venous compliance and an elevation in venous collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings suggest that an elevation in venous pressure may be associated with this disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A review of the literature has indicated that only subtle differences may exist in the pathophysiology among patients with LIAS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal-pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
