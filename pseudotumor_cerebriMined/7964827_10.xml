<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to study the visual outcome and relation to any shunting procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (20 eyes) were identified in whom follow up information of at least one year was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) and three had dural venous sinus occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had unilateral surgery and six had bilateral surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity and fields either improved or stabilised in 17 out of 20 eyes and three deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the eight patients undergoing unilateral surgery, the other eye remained stable in seven and deteriorated in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients required optic nerve sheath decompression despite previous shunting or subtemporal decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients required shunts or subtemporal decompression after optic nerve sheath decompression because of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in three cases and for uncontrolled visual failure in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients lost vision as a direct consequence of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that optic nerve sheath decompression is a safe and important therapeutic option in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vision can be saved after shunt failure, and in other cases may be maintained without the need for a shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Shunts may still be required, however, after optic nerve sheath decompression, especially for persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
