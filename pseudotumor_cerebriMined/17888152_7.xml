<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> is significantly associated with a discontinuation of treatment for idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> METHODS: The notes of 36 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> under regular review for at least 12 months by a single neuro-ophthalmologist were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Weight was recorded at each assessment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment was adjusted according to symptoms, visual function including visual fields and optic disc appearance only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided according to duration of continuous follow-up, and then sub-divided as to whether they were on or not on treatment at most recent review and whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> had been achieved compared to presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis was performed to assess the probability of remaining on treatment having lost weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Considering the patients as 3 groups, those with at least 12 months follow-up (n = 36), those with at least 18 months follow-up (n = 24) and those with 24 months or more follow-up (n = 19), only the group with 24 months or more follow-up demonstrated a significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and stopping systemic treatment (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis demonstrated that the probability of being on treatment at 5 years having gained weight was 0.63 and having lost weight was 0.38 (log rank test, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that final absolute body mass index is more important than the change in body mass index for patients who stop treatment (Mann Whitney U, p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> is associated with discontinuation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike previous studies, our results suggest that final absolute body mass index is more important for stopping treatment than a proportional reduction in weight </plain></SENT>
