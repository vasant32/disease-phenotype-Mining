<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The wide use of intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure monitoring has improved the management of patients with severe head injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rare but worrying complications associated with the application of such monitoring makes the idea of a non-invasive method of monitoring very attractive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A new non-invasive ultrasonographic technology was used to measure cerebral perfusion pressure in 27 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average monitoring time was 45.3+/-0.2 min, and the average perfusion pressure recorded was 77.4+/-0.3 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No complications were reported during the procedure, which was performed while the subjects were in regular ward beds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The non-invasive character of this method could extend the use of cerebral perfusion pressure measurement to several other neurosurgical entities, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and spinal cord injuries </plain></SENT>
