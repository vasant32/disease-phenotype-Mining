<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross sectional study with 289 patients consecutively attended to at AmbCef-UFMG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headaches</z:hpo> were diagnosed based on the criteria established by the International Classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Disorders (ICDH-2004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average age of patients was 42.6 years, mostly women (86.9%) with less than nine years of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> were the most common type, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> found in 79.8% of cases, and tension-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (TTH) in 20.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the secondary types, the most common was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> caused by overuse of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> (16.6%), followed by less common types, such as idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirms literature data showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> as the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in tertiary care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expressive number of cases of CDH and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> caused by overuse of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> indicates that, starting at the primary care level, patients should be advised to avoid the abuse of symptomatic drugs </plain></SENT>
