<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty women and eight men underwent 16 unilateral fenestrations and 12 bilateral operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> disappeared or was strikingly reduced in 24 of 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other four patients had gliotic discs (two patients) or were followed up for only a short time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity improved in 12 of 40 eyes and remained the same in 22 of 40 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen eyes had preoperative visual acuity of 20/30 or better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six eyes visual acuity decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of eight eyes operated on that had visual acuity of 20/200 or worse, only three showed improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Visual fields improved in 21 of 40 eyes and remained the same in ten eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of the ten eyes that did not change had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>poor vision</z:hpo> before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight eyes in five patients continued to lose acuity postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Each of these eight eyes had a concomitant loss of visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An additional two eyes developed visual field loss with preserved visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The indications for surgery are early evidence of progressive loss of visual field or acuity in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> presents little opportunity for improvement but fenestration may be used in a last effort to preserve or restore vision </plain></SENT>
