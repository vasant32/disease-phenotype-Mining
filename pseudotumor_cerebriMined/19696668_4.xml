<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to coalesce the current literature on the use of OCT in neuro-ophthalmology to enhance its use in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: OCT's advancement into spectral domain refined its ability to measure the RNFL by increasing scanner speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although OCT was shown to be superior to other instruments in measuring the RNFL in certain conditions, it lacks laser polarimetry's ability to detect microtubule changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, OCT's measurements cannot be used interchangeably with other instruments' assessments of the RNFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OCT has been studied in several neuro-ophthalmic conditions, including anterior ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo>/multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromyelitis optica</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, optic nerve head <z:hpo ids='HP_0011510'>drusen</z:hpo>, compressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo>, and Leber's hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: OCT's wide use in evaluating the optic nerve and the visual system has revolutionized our assessment, management, research, and understanding of neuro-ophthalmic diseases </plain></SENT>
