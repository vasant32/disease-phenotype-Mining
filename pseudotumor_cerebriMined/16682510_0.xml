<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PTC predominantly affects <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, the pathogenesis of PTC is obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since cytoskeletal abnormalities are found in many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, we hypothesized that some cytoskeletal protein might be involved in the pathophysiology of PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting with specific antibody probes was employed to evaluate ALZ-50 immunoreactive protein, cytoskeletal microtubule-associated protein (MAP), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 8 PTC patients and 6 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting of ALZ-50 in CSF revealed intense staining of 50 kDa protein bands in 7 of 8 PTC patients, while weak staining was found in 4 of 6 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moderate staining of ALZ-50 was seen in 1 of 8 PTC patients and in 2 of 6 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CSF blots with anti-ALZ-50 antibody also showed intense staining of a 65 kDa protein band in 3 of the 8 patients but in none of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In anti-MAP CSF blots of the PTC patients and controls, weak staining of the MAP 60 kDa and 50 kDa protein bands was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Weak staining of 60 kDa bands was also observed in anti-GFAP CSF blots of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PTC patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In CSF blots reacted with anti-GFAP antibody, 65 kDa and 32 kDa bands were evident in some PTC patients, but in none of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that ALZ-50 immunoreactivity is elevated in CSF of PTC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ALZ-50 immunoreactive protein, either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tau protein or its phosphorylated variant, may be useful as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Since the ALZ-50 monoclonal antibody was generated against brain homogenate from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) patients, this study suggests a possible link between PTC and AD </plain></SENT>
