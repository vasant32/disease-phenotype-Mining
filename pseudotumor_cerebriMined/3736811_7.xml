<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This rare consequence of an unusual inflammatory process has been reported on only two previous occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our patient initially presented with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo> and a mass in the sphenoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transsphenoidal biopsy revealed inflammatory tissue with a predominance of plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over 2 years later, computed tomographic scanning demonstrated involvement of the ipsilateral frontal lobe, and craniotomy revealed invasion of both the dura mater and the cortex by this inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for B and T cells was done to rule out <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and extensive cultures and staining were performed to identify any infectious process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because this progressive lesion did not respond to steroid treatment, radiation therapy to the affected area was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Orbital pseudotumor</z:e> should be considered when an inflammatory process is identified in the meninges and cortex of the anterior fossa </plain></SENT>
