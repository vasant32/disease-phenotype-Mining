<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Subtemporal decompression, first advocated by Dandy for the treatment of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, has been replaced as a treatment mainstay by medical management using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>, steroids, and lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Failure of these forms of treatment has frequently led to insertion of cerebrospinal fluid shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have retrospectively reviewed the long term outcome of eight patients who were treated by subtemporal decompression (STD) for classical presentations of refractory benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 8 to 26 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within 1 month of STD, deterioration in visual fields and acuity resolved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of eight patients required CSF diversion procedures after subtemporal decompression to control <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient experienced recurrent permanent visual deterioration after STD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: STD may be the most effective treatment in both long and short term follow-up to provide lasting relief and prevention of visual morbidity caused by refractory benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
