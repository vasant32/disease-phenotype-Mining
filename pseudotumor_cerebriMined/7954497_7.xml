<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to correlate intracranial pressure with cerebral blood flow velocities and brain energy metabolism in adult rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was achieved by pressure transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler wave-forms were obtained from the basilar artery for monitoring cerebral blood flow velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi>-Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to assess brain energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diastolic blood flow velocity began to decrease significantly (34.5%) when the intracranial pressure was equal to half the diastolic arterial pressure for a CPP of 36 +/- 18 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Circulatory cerebral resistances increased significantly (55%) for the same value of CPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diastolic frequency was near zero when intracranial pressure approached diastolic arterial pressure (51 +/- 12 mmHg), corresponding to a CPP of 30 +/- 15 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the same time, only a tendency for brain energy metabolism to decrease was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consequently, transcranial Doppler sonography could be proposed for the follow-up of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy could help to monitor these patients and could be especially proposed in case of high intracranial pressure (near diastolic arterial pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The joint use of these two methods would help in making appropriate therapeutic decision in humans </plain></SENT>
