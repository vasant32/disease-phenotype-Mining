<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One randomly selected eye of 22 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) and a variable degree of optic disc swelling underwent five and three repeated measurements of disc height using high-resolution ultrasonography (Biovision unit; Quantel Medical, Clermont-Ferrand, France) and CSLO (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph [HRT]; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same procedure was assessed in 14 subjects with variable degrees of physiologic optic disc cupping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>US and HRT measurements from each group were individually compared with each other to estimate the accuracy of US readings in both disc conditions in comparison with HRT data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ultrasonographic readings were positively correlated with HRT measurements in both swollen (r = 0.62, P: = 0.002) and excavated disc (r = 0.84, P: &lt; 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 95% limits of agreement between the instruments were 0.24 +/- 0.59 mm (mean +/- 2 SD) and 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>05 +/- 0.3 mm for swelling and cupping measurements, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The coefficient of variation was 7.63% and 1.8% for swelling and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>93% and 5.91% for cupping, with US and HRT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that US and CSLO readings are correlated i: both disc swelling and cupping conditions, but to a different extent because of a significant discrepancy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>US assessment can be considered highly reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combined US and HRT optic disc analysis may be recommended in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> evaluation as long as a better correlation can be demonstrated in further studies </plain></SENT>
