<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with this condition may suffer from intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, experience visual deterioration, or have other symptoms related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Internal cranial expansion (ICE) is a novel surgical procedure that the authors have developed for the treatment of patients with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, they describe ICE and present their initial experience in using this surgical procedure for the treatment of patients with refractory IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of 10 consecutive patients who underwent ICE for the treatment of IIH during a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and postoperative clinical parameters including patient symptoms, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, and available ICP or CSF opening pressures were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedural details and complications were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracranial volume increases were calculated using available pre- and postoperative CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up for the 10 patients in this series ranged from 1 to 39.6 months (mean 15.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Technically successful ICE was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients within the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical complications included a single postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> in one patient and a sagittal sinus tear with no clinical sequelae in another patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the time of last follow-up, 7 (70%) of 10 patients were either symptomatically improved or asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six (67%) of 9 patients with preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> had reduction or resolution of this symptom, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (4 of 4) with preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> had a reduction in or complete resolution of this sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Postoperative ICP or CSF opening pressures were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (4 of 4) tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Postoperative intracranial volume expansion ranged between 3.8% and 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Internal cranial expansion is a safe and effective surgery for the treatment of patients with refractory IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This surgery expands the intracranial volume and thus promotes ICP normalization, which may lead to the reduction or complete resolution of the signs and symptoms of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Internal cranial expansion may be used as part of a multidisciplinary management approach in the treatment of refractory IIH </plain></SENT>
