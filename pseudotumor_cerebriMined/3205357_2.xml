<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of seventy cases included so-called <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>) secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH; 34 cases), idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> (17 cases), secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> whose symptoms developed after operations for <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, head injuries or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (12 cases) and other intracranial diseases including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220654" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">meningeal carcinomatosis</z:e>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(7 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Shunt operation was effective in 36 cases and not effective in 9 cases, while 25 cases were not shunted since LSP was not elevated or clinical manifestations were slight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean values of baseline pressure and maximum pressure in shunt effective group, shunt non-effective group and non-shunted group were 14.5, 12.7, 9.0 and 29.9, 25.0, 17.9 mmHg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical difference was observed between shunt effective group and non-shunted group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequency of pressure waves was also significantly higher in shunt effective group than in non-shunted group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, measurement of LSP was regarded as useful in idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, preoperative clinical symptoms had a closer relationship to shunt response than results of LSP in post SAH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complication related to this monitoring was negligible except in one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> which was easily treated by administration of antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up study also justified our selection since no further deterioration was noted in non-shunted group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that measurement of LSP would be useful in selecting the patients who will benefit from shunting and in eliminating unnecessary shunt operations because this simple method is easily performed at bed side without perforating the skull.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
