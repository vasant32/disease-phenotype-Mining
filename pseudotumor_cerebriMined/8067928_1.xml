<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to contribute to the understanding of the origin of this reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the middle-ear impedance modifications induced by unilateral and bilateral jugular compression in 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, in 12 patients afflicted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000362'>otosclerosis</z:hpo>, in 3 patients with Menière's disease and in 6 patients demonstrating intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the latter group, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was simultaneously recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The JTR was elicited in each <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subject and in each patient affected by Menière's disease and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, while it was usually absent or modified in otosclerotic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absence of the JTR in otosclerotic patients and, above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, the correspondence between CSF pressure and the middle-ear impedance modification induced by jugular compression suggest that it is due to the transmission of pressure changes from the CSF to the perilymph through the cochlear aqueduct </plain></SENT>
