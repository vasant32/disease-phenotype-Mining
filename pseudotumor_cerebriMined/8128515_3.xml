<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Embolization, staged resection, and meticulous surgical technique have decreased but not completely eliminated this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we prospectively assess the prevalence of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> after excision of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>, examine factors predisposing to this complication, and document the outcome of aggressive monitoring and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 4-year period at a single institution, 32 consecutive patients with cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> underwent surgical excision after staged embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent postoperative monitoring of ICP and a uniform management protocol of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intractable intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was encountered after resection of 9 of 32 cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>, including 3 of 20 (15%) <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> 6 cm or less in maximum diameter and 6 of 12 (50%) <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> greater than 6 cm in maximum diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This complication occurred in 5 of 10 (50%) lesions located in distal or border-zone locations, in 4 of 9 (44%) <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> arising directly off proximal cerebral arteries, and in none of 13 <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> in other locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission-computed tomography perfusion scans were performed in 17 patients and demonstrated parenchymal hypoperfusion beyond the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> nidus in 5 of 10 <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> 6 cm or less in maximum diameter, none of which manifested postoperative intractable ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypoperfusion was observed on single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission-computed tomography in 7 of 7 <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> greater than 6 cm that were studied by this modality, and intractable ICP was observed postoperatively in 5 of these cases despite preoperative staged embolization in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptomatic intractable ICP were treated with intravenous short-acting <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> under a strict critical care protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no instance of uncontrollable intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or break-through <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> while on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no permanent morbidity related to this treatment and no mortality or new disability morbidity in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that intractable intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> remains a common complication after resection of a subgroup of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> despite preoperative embolization, modern neuroanesthesia and critical care management, and microsurgical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A proactive management protocol aimed at ICP control is safe and effective in the management of this complication </plain></SENT>
