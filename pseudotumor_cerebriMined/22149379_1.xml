<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date there is a paucity of information on the angiographic and hemodynamic outcome of these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The object of this study was to define the clinical, angiographic, and hemodynamic outcome of placement of unilateral dural sinus stents to treat intracranial venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in a subgroup of patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of IIH were treated with unilateral stent placement in the transverse-sigmoid junction region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 female patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>; 1 of 6 males had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> previously that disappeared after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had elevated opening pressures at lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had opening pressures of 33-55 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent diagnostic cerebral arteriography that showed venous outflow compromise by filling defects in the transverse-sigmoid junction region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent intracranial selective venous pressure measurements across the filling defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up arteriography was performed in 16 patients and follow-up venography/venous pressure measurements were performed in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial pressure gradients across the filling defects ranged from 10.5 to 39 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nineteen stent procedures were performed in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent repeat stent placement for hemodynamic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pressure gradients were reduced in every instance and ranged from 0 to 7 mm Hg after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 16 patients in whom ophthalmological follow-up was performed experienced disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Follow-up arteriography in 16 patients at 5-99 months (mean 25.3 months, median 18.5 months) showed patency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stents without in-stent restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Two patients had filling defects immediately above the stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Four other patients developed transverse sinus narrowing above the stent without filling defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>One of these patients underwent repeat stent placement because of hemodynamic deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Two of the other 3 patients had hemodynamic deterioration with recurrent pressure gradients of 10.5 and 18 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stents remained patent without restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Stent placement is durable and successfully eliminates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in appropriately selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Continuing hemodynamic success in this series was 80%, and was 87% with repeat stent placement in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
