<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six men and six women without cerebral or <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> diseases were selected as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Androstenedione (A), <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (T), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17252">17-hydroxyprogesterone</z:chebi> (17OH-P), E1 and E2 were measured in plasma and CSF in baseline conditions and following 1 month <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> therapy (2 mg/die, per os) using RIA following chromatographic separation on celite microcolumns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Men and women affected by PTC show increased CSF E1 levels and marked decreased CSF A levels, with respect to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In plasma, on the contrary, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values of these parameters were observed in PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects A/E1 ratio shows the same values in plasma and CSF, suggesting for the two hormones analogous feasibility to cross the blood brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In PTC patients A/E1 ratio is comparable to controls in plasma, but lower in CSF as a result of decreased A and increased E1 contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CSF imbalance between A and E1 attenuates but does not disappear after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation is found between pressure levels and steroid pattern both in baseline condition or after one month of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PTC is not only associated with increased CSF E1 levels, as previously suggested, but, above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, with decreased CSF A levels and this hormonal impairement seems to be confined to the CSF compartment and not observed in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data do not lead to any definitive conclusion about the role of altered CSF <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> levels in PTC pathogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
