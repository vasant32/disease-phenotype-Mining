<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such changes are regionally variable and are best seen in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased water content in cerebral cortex was demonstrated after steroid withdrawal and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinyloestradiol</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We believe that these experimental findings may have relevance in the clinical situation and may help in understanding the pathogenesis of some types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One such example is benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> is seen typically in young <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> females and is also associated with the contraceptive pill, pregnancy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> withdrawal </plain></SENT>
