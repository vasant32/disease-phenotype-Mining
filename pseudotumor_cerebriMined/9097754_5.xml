<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer photographs and visual fields from 36 eyes of 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> due to idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were analyzed for abnormalities in a masked fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nerve fiber layer changes were found in 67% of eyes studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Superior areas within the nerve fiber layer were affected 5.4 times more frequently than inferior regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual field loss was more prevalent in eyes with diffuse nerve fiber layer loss (89%) than in eyes with slit defects (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The location of the nerve fiber layer changes correlated with corresponding areas of visual field loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nerve fiber layer changes were as common in mild to moderate as in atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>; however, slit defects predominated in patients with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, and diffuse loss predominated in atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer observed in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> provide objective information regarding the status of their optic nerve and may improve their clinical management </plain></SENT>
