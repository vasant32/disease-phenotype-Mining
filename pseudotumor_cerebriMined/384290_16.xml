<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Servocontrolled variable rate lumbar infusions were used to determine net CSF-absorptive capacities and resting pressures in 10 patients; serial studies were done in 5 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients had abnormally low CSF-absorptive capacities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, marked elevations in resting pressure were not a constant feature of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concurrent changes in the cerebrovascular bed could introduce errors into this manometric determination of CSF dynamics; the significance of this potential artifact is examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that the CSF compartment may be of etiological importance in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
