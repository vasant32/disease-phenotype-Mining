<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This series of 75 anatomo-clinical cases with this lesion provides sufficient material for a valuable statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After enumerating the different cerebral symptoms of this disease, the author makes a macroscopic and microscopic morphological analysis and compares his own results with those found in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The embryologic investigations mentioned and the hypotheses to which they lead do not shed light on the origin of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mathematical analysis indicates a difference in frequency between both sexes, with a far greater frequency in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Referring to the grey commissure's agenesia, mentioned by Morel as statistically more frequent in men than in women, the author concludes that the colloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> of the third ventricle are also to be considered as a cerebral anomaly related to sex </plain></SENT>
