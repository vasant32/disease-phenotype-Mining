<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data was extracted from the medical records and Stratus OCT images of IIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-<z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eyes</z:mp> of 48 IIH patients were divided into 3 groups according to their clinical optic disc appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was statistically different between the groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> optic disc/mild elevation group (N=20) - 89 μm (95% CI, 80-98 μm), mild elevation group (N=51) - 109 μm (95% CI, 101-117 μm), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> group (N=20) 124 μm (95% CI, 100-153 μm) (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fast macular thickness map did not demonstrate a significant difference between the groups for most measured macular areas (N=49 eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Peripapillary RNFL measurements correlated with the clinical appearance of the optic discs, suggesting that OCT may assist in the follow up of IIH patients </plain></SENT>
