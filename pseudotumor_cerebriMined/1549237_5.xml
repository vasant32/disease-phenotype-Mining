<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> were significantly older than those with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, but there were no significant differences between the two groups in disease duration, elevation of intracranial pressure, visual fields and acuity, and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> or transient visual obscurations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>I hypothesize that, in patients with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, one optic nerve is protected from pressure effects by optic nerve sheath anomalies or lamina cribrosa changes due to increased collagen and decreased elasticity with aging </plain></SENT>
