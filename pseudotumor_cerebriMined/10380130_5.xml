<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the 24-2 Humphrey visual field (HVF) (Humphrey, San Leandro, CA) strategy provides information comparable to that provided by the 30-2 strategy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029132" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">optic nerve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In part A of the study, an occluder device was designed to cover the additional outer 22 points tested in the 30-2 strategy of 187 HVFs from neuro-ophthalmology patients with nonglaucomatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> and 206 HVFs from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This device converted the gray scale and probability plots of the 30-2 HVF to a 24-2 field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fields were initially read using the occluder and then were read in a masked manner without the occluder and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In part B, 15 healthy volunteers performed both 30-2 and 24-2 HVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Testing time and global indices were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five percent of the fields in the neuro-ophthalmology patients, 96% of the fields in patients under observation for suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, 98% of the fields in patients with ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and 100% of the fields in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> were read similarly with the 24-2 and 30-2 strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the few cases in which a discrepancy was noted between the 24-2 and the 30-2 fields, appropriate clinical management would not have been compromised by using the 24-2 strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of these cases were in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and very subtle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0474334" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nerve fiber bundle defects</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 24-2 strategy had a significantly lower pattern standard deviation (P &lt; 0.01) and corrected pattern standard deviation (P = 0.05) than did the 30-2 strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the 24-2 strategy shortened the standard threshold testing time by 28% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers (P &lt; 0.0001 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In most cases, the 24-2 testing strategy provides information comparable to that provided by the 30-2 strategy in a shorter time and with less variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A 30-2 HVF may be warranted in patients under observation for evolving idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
