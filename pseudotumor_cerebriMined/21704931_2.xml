<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, or benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH), is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our results from 18 cases of venous sinus stenting (VSS), the largest series in the literature, with specific focus on the rate of technical success, amelioration of the subjective symptom of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, attendant complications, and radiographic patency on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Review of our prospectively maintained database identified 18 patients who had undergone 19 VSS procedures for the placement of 30 stents in the past 2.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications for treatment included a clinical diagnosis of BIH with venographic demonstration of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VSS was technically successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered a permanent complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 15 patients were followed clinically and asked to rate their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> severity on a scale of 1 to 10 both before and after VSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 12 patients (80%) qualified their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> as better after VSS, two stated that they were the same, and one patient said that they were worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 14 patients who underwent follow-up angiography, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patency of the stented segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one of these patients, stenosis was detected on follow-up in the unstented segment of the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VSS is highly effective (80%) in ameliorating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> associated with BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The procedure is associated with a high rate of technical success (100%), a low rate of permanent complications (0), and a high rate of stent patency on follow-up angiography (100%) </plain></SENT>
