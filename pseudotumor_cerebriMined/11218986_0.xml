<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have studied 30 patients, subdivided in four groups, depending on the type of neurologic illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have chosen as control a 10-patient group, which came to the Emergency Service and were diagnosed as a suspicious of neurologic illness, but after this it was discarded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the whole group we practiced a lumbar puncture, with cytology, systematic, biochemistry, cultures, immunoglobulins determination and fibronectin quantification by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We want to emphasize the increase in fibronectin levels in CSF in both the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and the multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> groups, when it's compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For this, the determination of fibronectin levels in CSF might be a useful parameter in the diagnosis of some neurologic illnesses </plain></SENT>
