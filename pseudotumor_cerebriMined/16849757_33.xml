<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MTD was defined as zero to one of six patients with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), with at least two of three or two of six DLT at next higher dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-four patients, age 2 years to 20 years (median, 9 years), were treated: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> (n = 39), Ewing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (n = 5), and other (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior therapy included autologous stem cell transplantation (n = 42), 13-cis-RA (n = 35), and 9-cis-RA (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of four patients at 1,050 mg/m2 with prior liver transplant had grade 3 ALT/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> and grade 4 AST/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>emesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1,860 mg/m2, one of seven patients had grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003073'>hypoalbuminemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002148'>hypophosphatemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 2,475 mg/m2, one of eight patients had grade 3 alkaline phosphatase; three of five patients had DLT at 3,300 mg/m2: grade 3 AST/ALT (n = 1), grade 4 bilirubin/grade 3 AST/ALT (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> also occurred at 600 mg/m2 and 800 mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was one complete response and 13 patients with stable disease (SD) for 8 or more courses in 30 assessable <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SD for 8 or more courses was seen in one of five Ewing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> patients and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean N-4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide plasma level (day 7, steady-state concentration) was 9.9 mumol/L at MTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The pediatric MTD of oral capsular fenretinide was 2,475 mg/m2 per day, which achieved levels active against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> in vitro with minimal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Response data support a phase II trial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
