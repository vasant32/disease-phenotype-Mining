<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients with definite IIH seen between 1989 and 2006 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographics, associated factors, and visual function at presentation and follow-up were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Black patients were compared to non-black patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 450 patients (197 black, 253 non-black) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> were more common in black patients than in non-black patients (p &lt;/= 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSF opening pressure was higher in black patients (40 vs 34 cm CSF, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity, visual field loss, and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> at presentation and follow-up were worse in black patients (p &lt;/= 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic and therapeutic measures were similar between black patients and non-black patients, except for optic nerve sheath fenestration (p = 0.01) and lumbar puncture (p = 0.03), both more commonly performed on black patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> for black patients compared with non-black patients was 3.5 (95% CI 2.0 to 5.8, p &lt; 0.001) in at least <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> and 4.8 (95% CI 2.1 to 10.9, p &lt; 0.001) in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis supported race, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, body mass index, and male gender as independent risk factors for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and suggested that racial differences may be partially accounted for by differences in CSF opening pressure, body mass index, and frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Black patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) were more likely than non-black patients with IIH to have severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in at least <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This difference did not appear to result from diagnosis, treatment, or access to care, but may partially relate to differences in other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Black patients have a more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> and may need closer follow-up and lower thresholds for early intervention </plain></SENT>
