<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have investigated the accuracy with which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used in clinical practice to evaluate the encephalic ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, adequate evaluation of pathological conditions depends on a sufficient amount of morphometric data from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To begin establishing this data base for "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" subjects, we evaluated the MRI scans of 38 subjects found to have no apparent pathology and calculated the ventricular volume in each case by using methods previously developed in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were then compared with published volumes determined from studies that used either ventricular casts or computerized tomographic scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average total ventricular volume for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 38 subjects was 17.4 cm3, while that for males was 16.3 cm3 and that for females was 18.0 cm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A small but significant correlation was found between age of subject and ventricular volume, with ventricular size increasing with age </plain></SENT>
