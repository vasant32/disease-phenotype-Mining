<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects on intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and EEG monitored by Cerebral Function Monitor (CFM) were compared after bolus administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (n = 55) and thiopentone (n = 67) to control intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 18 severely head injured patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">Mannitol</z:chebi> increased CPP in 89% of occasions and thiopentone in only 54% (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thiopentone caused a mean increase in CPP +0.6 kPa (+5.0 +/- 1.6 mmHg) when the minimum pre-bolus voltage of CFM was above 4 microV and a fall in CPP -0.5 kPa (-4.1 +/- 1.6 mmHg) when cortical electrical activity was already severely depressed (p &lt; 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When pre-bolus CFM was below 4 microV <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> was superior to thiopentone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This different effect on CPP was due to a significantly greater fall in mean arterial pressure in the thiopentone sub-group -1.6 versus -0.3 kPa (-12.4 +/- 1.5 mmHg, -2.8 +/- 1.2 mmHg; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe and unpredictable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> occurred, particularly in the thiopentone low CFM sub-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This symptomatic therapy seems inadequate but a targeted treatment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> could be possible only with a more sophisticated monitoring, including continuous data on cerebral blood flow and adequacy to metabolic demand </plain></SENT>
