<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This finding has not been rigorously documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore systematically investigated globe shape in these cases using computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Computed tomographic 0.625-mm sections of 10 cases with IIH and 10 control subjects were reformatted on a workstation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Globe lengths and widths were measured from axial reformats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Globe lengths and heights were measured from oblique sagittal reformats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two masked observers took <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean axial lengths of the globes of cases with IIH were significantly shorter than those of controls (t test for independent samples, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both observers also found globe height to be significantly greater than globe length in oblique sagittal sections of cases with IIH compared with control subjects (Mann-Whitney U tests, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference between length and width in axial sections was not different between cases with IIH and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using a critical cutoff of 0.6-mm difference between globe height and length in oblique sagittal sections returned a sensitivity of 0.75 and a specificity of 0.75 for IIH detection from both right and left eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in globe shape and axial length between cases with IIH and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The differences in globe shape manifest significantly only in oblique sagittal sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This imaging sign could be a useful marker for subclinical IIH </plain></SENT>
