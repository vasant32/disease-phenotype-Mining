<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups except that termed "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>" had similar alpha 2-m levels, but alpha 1-at and transferrin were significantly depressed in MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total protein levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and IgG levels were elevated in MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of alpha 1-at were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> so the decreases observed in the CSF in MS were not due to impaired systemic production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In view of previous reports that proteinase activity is high in MS plaques and CSF, the inhibitory capacity of alpha 2-m and alpha 1-at in CSF was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As any decreases in inhibitory capacity noted in MS were slight, they could only be important in the local environment of a plaque where enzyme levels may be critically high </plain></SENT>
