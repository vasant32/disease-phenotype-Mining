<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple theories have been proposed in the past to explain BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Today it is widely accepted that the condition occurs in situations where alteration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reabsorption is encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The venous system is therefore involved and may be the common denominator of the pathophysiological theories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A distinction must be made between idiopathic benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and BIH resulting from drugs, other pathological conditions, or toxics (secondary BIH), which are reported in this paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We emphasize the crucial role of exhaustive clinical, biological, and neuroradiological investigations aiming to establish the diagnosis of BIH </plain></SENT>
