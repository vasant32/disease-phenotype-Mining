<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> (acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo>) in association with lumboperitoneal (LP) shunting is well recognized, it has previously been considered rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to ascertain the incidence of this complication after LP shunting, the authors undertook a retrospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom this form of shunt had been inserted between 1974 and 1991 at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 143 patients, the mean age at insertion was 3.3 years and the indications for shunt placement were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (81%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (7%), cerebrospinal fluid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (6%), and posterior fossa <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270687" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudomeningocele</z:e> (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 5.7 years, during which time there was one shunt-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to unsuspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five other patients developed symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> treated by suboccipital decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> computerized tomography (CT) scans not degraded by artifact showed evidence of excess soft tissue at the level of the foramen magnum in 38 (70%) of 54 patients so studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to confirm that this CT finding represented hindbrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e>, sagittal and axial magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images were obtained for 17 asymptomatic patients and revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> (range 2 to 21 mm) in 12 (70.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, some of these asymptomatic patients had evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">uncal herniation</z:e> and mesencephalic distortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarities and distinctions are drawn between the morphological changes occurring after LP shunting and those seen in association with the Chiari I and II malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although less than 5% of this study population required treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e>, the incidence of this complication was high in asymptomatic patients; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging surveillance for patients with LP shunts is therefore recommended </plain></SENT>
