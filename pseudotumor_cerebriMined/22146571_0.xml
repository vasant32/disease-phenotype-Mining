<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS), ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) and optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) are accepted surgical therapies for medically refractory idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the subset of patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis, dural venous sinus stenting has emerged as an alternative surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of dural stents for IIH at our institution were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligibility criteria included medically refractory IIH with documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and dural venous sinus stenosis of the dominant venous outflow system (gradient â‰¥10 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen cases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women) of mean age 34 years were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had failed medical therapy and six had failed surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Technical success was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without major periprocedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean preprocedural gradient across the venous stenosis was reduced from 24 mm Hg before the procedure to 4 mm Hg after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> resolved or improved in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> resolved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and visual acuity stabilized or improved in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no instances of restenosis among the 14 patients with follow-up imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this small case series, dural sinus stenting for IIH was performed safely with a high degree of technical success and with excellent clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that angioplasty and stenting for the treatment of medically refractory IIH in patients with dural sinus stenosis warrants further investigation as an alternative to LPS, VPS and ONSF </plain></SENT>
