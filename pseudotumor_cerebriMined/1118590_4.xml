<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate a predictable relationship does exist between the rCBF and tc15o </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This relationship is linear when plotted as tc15o vs. 1/CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, tc150 can be estimated with sufficient accuracy from the AVCT to permit at least a qualitative assessment of rCBF from the cerebral angiogram </plain></SENT>
