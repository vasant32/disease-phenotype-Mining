<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Orbital imaging correlates of this syndrome include flattening of the posterior globe and distention of the perioptic subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanism responsible for the clinical and radiographic findings of this syndrome is undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients with unusual presentations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> are reported whose clinical and radiographic findings were otherwise identical to those described in the idiopathic syndrome of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0000540'>hyperopia</z:hpo> with choroidal folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had unilateral disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and bilateral choroidal folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other patient had bilateral choroidal folds observed 2 years before he developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients had intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, idiopathic in the first, and related to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001648'>cor pulmonale</z:hpo> in the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A third patient is also described who had typical clinical and orbital imaging findings of idiopathic unilateral acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0000540'>hyperopia</z:hpo> with choroidal folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He was also found to have mild intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> can cause acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0000540'>hyperopia</z:hpo> and choroidal folds and may be the underlying mechanism in some patients with what appears to be idiopathic acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0000540'>hyperopia</z:hpo> with choroidal folds </plain></SENT>
