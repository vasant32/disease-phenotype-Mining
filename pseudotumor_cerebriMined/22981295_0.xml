<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the role of transverse sinus stenosis in IIH pathogenesis remains controversial, modeling studies suggest that stent placement within a transverse sinus stenosis with a significant pressure gradient should decrease cerebral venous pressure, improve CSF resorption in the venous system, and thereby reduce intracranial (CSF) pressure, improving the symptoms of IIH and reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beside the classical surgical treatments, venous sinus stenting could be a treatment option for many patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, additional work, preferably controlled prospective studies, needs to be performed to prove its safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
