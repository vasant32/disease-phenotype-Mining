<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the course, outcome, and risk of relapse or late worsening in a clearly defined cohort of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) over a long period of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients with definite IIH was evaluated at the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology between 1998 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients' demographic data, clinical, neuro-ophthalmic examinations, and treatment details were abstracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were further categorized into three groups based on whether they improved, worsened, or relapsed on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final visual outcome of each patient was defined according to grading of the worse eye at the last visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis included t test to compare group means and chi-square test to compare proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 43 women included, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> was observed in 80 eyes (93%) at presentation and it was moderate to severe in 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean CSF opening pressure at presentation did not differ significantly in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> compared to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those having early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001141'>severe visual impairment</z:hpo> had significantly higher (P = 0.015) likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001141'>severe visual impairment</z:hpo> on last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the total, 34 patients (79%) improved, 4 (9.3%) relapsed on follow-up after period of stability, and 5 (11.6%) worsened over 56 months follow-up (range, 26-132 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The groups were comparable, except those who improved were younger (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At last examination, 9% had significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IIH patients can have delayed worsening or relapses and about tenth of patients can have permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> early or late in the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with IIH need to be kept under long-term follow-up, with regular monitoring of visual functions </plain></SENT>
