<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral injury is seen in one of three patients with multiple traumas; thus efficient shock treatment is a most important measure against the development of secondary brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small-volume resuscitation in severe hemorrhagic shock by hypertonic/hyperoncotic saline/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> has been shown to instantaneously normalize cardiac output and to raise systemic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the fluid regimen was compared with hypertonic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> to investigate their therapeutic efficacy in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experiments were performed in rabbits subjected to a focal lesion of the brain to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was enhanced in a standard manner by inflation of an epidural balloon until an intracranial pressure (ICP) of 17 mm Hg was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of either 7.2% saline/10% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>-60 or of 20% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> rapidly decreased the elevated ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the first injection, ICP lowering was maintained longer by the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> than by the hypertonic saline/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>, whereas no differences in duration of ICP lowering were found when the infusions of these solutions were repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The systemic blood pressure increased after injection of the saline/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> solution, but it tended to decrease after injection of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transient increases in plasma osmolality, colloid-osmotic pressure, and plasma-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> were more pronounced after administration of the saline/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> solution than after the administration of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No difference in the tissue water content between the traumatized and contralateral hemisphere was observed in the animals receiving <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>; however, after saline/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> infusion, the water content was somewhat increased in the exposed hemisphere but decreased in the nonexposed, contralateral hemisphere (decreased to a point even below the corresponding level of animals who received the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increase of the cerebral water content of the traumatized hemisphere was associated with a respective increase of the cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> content and a (nonsignificant) decrease of the K+ content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present findings demonstrate that the hypertonic/hyperoncotic saline/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> was as efficient as the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> in reducing ICP that had been increased by a cerebral lesion and a space-occupying mass; the underlying mechanisms responsible for the reduction might differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of the powerful hemodynamic properties of the saline/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> in circulatory shock, administration of the solution in patients with multiple traumas and head injury might be particularly advantageous for the prevention of secondary ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
