<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Object The authors examined the role of venous sinus obstruction in the etiology of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) by reviewing more than 200 MR venograms performed in suspected cases of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods Individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venograms performed in cases of suspected IIH at the Children's Hospital at Westmead in Sydney, Australia, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors excluded cases in which an intervention was performed before the scan or a structural cause for venous obstruction was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases with confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> were also excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each of the 145 remaining scans, the authors completed a detailed review on a slice-by-slice basis of the 2D source images used to compile the rendered 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anatomical configuration of the dural venous sinuses and any areas of decreased flow in circulation were then noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Where possible, they correlated their radiological findings with evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> based on LP opening pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also reviewed a control group of 50 MR venograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results Seventy-six (52%) of 145 scans showed evidence of venous obstruction in the dominant-side circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Substantial nonphysiological collateral circulation was seen in 68% of cases with dominant-sided obstruction, suggesting a process of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the absence of dominant-sided obstruction, collateral circulation was uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 27 cases, CSF opening pressure measurements were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 20 cases the opening pressures were in excess of 20 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of those, 17 demonstrated evidence of dominant-sided venous outflow obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among those cases, the median opening pressure was 34 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Dominant-sided venous outflow obstruction was seen in only 2 of 50 MR venograms in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, evidence of collateral circulation was also uncommon in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There was a highly statistically significant difference between rates of dominant-sided venous obstruction in the suspected IIH and control groups (p â‰¤ 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Conclusions A majority of patients presenting for investigation of suspected IIH demonstrated evidence of dominant-sided venous obstruction on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In addition there was a high correlation between elevated CSF opening pressures and dominant-sided venous sinus obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This correlation was further supported by evidence of collateral recanalization in patients with elevated CSF pressures and dominant-sided venous obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A control group of 50 MR venograms indicated that dominant-sided venous outflow obstruction is an unlikely incidental finding, and a highly statistically significant difference was found between rates of obstruction in the suspected IIH and control groups </plain></SENT>
