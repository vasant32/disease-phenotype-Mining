<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> may lead to irreversible damage of optic nerve fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To preserve visual functions, a decompression of the optic nerve is recommended by means of a fenestration of the optic nerve sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study long-term results after optic nerve sheath fenestration in patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 14 patients were re-examined 15 to 145 months (mean 62 months) after a fenestration of the retrobulbar optic nerve sheath on 23 eyes by a transconjunctival approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery was done to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000529'>progressive visual loss</z:hpo> or in severe obscurations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's symptoms, visual acuity, visual fields, and ophthalmoscopic findings of the optic nerve head and the central fundus were compared to the preoperative status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Re-examination revealed improvement or stabilisation of objective and subjective findings in 17 eyes, one of them was operated on the more involved contralateral side only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six eyes showed a recurrence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> without a functional change for the worse after an interval of 7 to 121 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three eyes of two patients ended up with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, these eyes had shown <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cotton wool spots</z:e> in the optic nerve head and a rapid deterioration of vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fenestration of the retrobulbar optic nerve sheath can prevent further <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, unless the eye has already become nearly blind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, ophthalmological controls are necessary at regular intervals because relapses after successful surgery can occur after months or years </plain></SENT>
