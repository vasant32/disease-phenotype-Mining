<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the one hand we compared the resulting long-term pressure behaviour of the VFP (ventricular fluid pressure) with clinical and paraclinical parameters and, on the other, with the consumed sorbitol dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this procedure advantages of the automatically dehydrating cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> therapy could be proved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was possible to find clear relations between the pre-operative general changes in the EEG, the degree of the cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in the CT, pre-operatively diagnosed choked papillas and the osmotherapeutical expenditure in the postoperative phase </plain></SENT>
