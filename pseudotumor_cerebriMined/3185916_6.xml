<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 24 out of 30 eyes (14 of 15 patients) had a visual disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuro-ophthalmologic examination demonstrated abnormal Goldmann visual fields in 13 of 30 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CS was abnormal in 18 eyes; VEP was abnormal in five eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine eyes had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> detected by CS only, five by perimetry only, and one had the VEP as the sole abnormality </plain></SENT>
