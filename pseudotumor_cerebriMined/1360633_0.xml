<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Doppler recordings of the middle cerebral artery displayed an extreme modification in their configuration in the form of an orthograde systolic flow component with zero diastolic flow or an oscillating flow immediately after occurrence of rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reoccurrence of a diastolic flow component in still markedly raised cerebrovascular resistance index could be demonstrated a short time later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> with preexisting vasospasm leads to a severe temporary disturbance of cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vasospasm is likely to lead to a delayed normalization of perfusion and thus to prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
