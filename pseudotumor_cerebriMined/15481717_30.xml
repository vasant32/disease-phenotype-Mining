<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts effectively reverse symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> postoperatively, but long-term outcome has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lumboperitoneal (LP) shunts are the mainstay of CSF shunts for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>; however, image-guided stereotaxy and neuroendoscopy now allow effective placement of a ventricular catheter without causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date it remains unknown if CSF shunts provide long-term relief from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> and whether a ventricular shunt is better than an LP shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated these possibilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> shunt placement procedures that were performed for intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> at one institution between 1973 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using proportional hazards regression analysis, predictors of treatment failure (continued <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> despite a properly functioning shunt) were assessed, and shunt revision and complication rates were compared between LP and ventricular (ventriculoperitoneal [VP] or ventriculoatrial [VAT]) shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients underwent 115 shunt placement procedures: 79 in which an LP shunt was used and 36 in which a VP or VAT shunt was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty patients (95%) experienced a significant improvement in their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> immediately after the shunt was inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> recurred despite a properly functioning shunt in eight (19%) and 20 (48%) patients by 12 and 36 months, respectively, after the initial shunt placement surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and 19 patients in whom preoperative symptoms had occurred for longer than 2 years experienced recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, making patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> or long-term symptoms fivefold (relative risk [RR] 5.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-17.8; p &lt; 0.01) or 2.5-fold (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.01-9.39; p = 0.05) more likely to experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> recurrence, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to VP or VAT shunts, LP shunts were associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of shunt revision (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.3; p &lt; 0.001) due to a threefold increased risk of shunt obstruction (RR 3, 95% CI 1.5-5.7; p &lt; 0.005), but there were similar risks between the two types of shunts for overdrainage (RR 2.3, 95% CI 0.8-7.9; p = 0.22), distal catheter migration (RR 2.1, 95% CI 0.3-19.3; p = 0.55), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1141920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">shunt infection</z:e> (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.3-13.2; p = 0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on their 30-year experience in the treatment of these patients, the authors found that CSF shunts were extremely effective in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>-associated intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, providing long-term relief in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and long-standing symptoms were risk factors for treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The use of ventricular shunts for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> was associated with a lower risk of shunt obstruction and revision than the use of LP shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Using ventricular shunts in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> or symptoms lasting less than 2 years should be considered for those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>-associated intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
