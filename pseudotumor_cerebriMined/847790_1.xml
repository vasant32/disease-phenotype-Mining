<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total and regional cerebral blood flows were measured using labelled microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spontaneously breathing dogs total and regional cerebral blood flows increased when cerebral perfusion pressure was reduced to 20 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in regional flows was greater in the infratentorial areas than in the supratentorial areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in cerebral flow in spontaneously breathing dogs was associated with the development of hypoxemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005972'>respiratory acidosis</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of ventilation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease in regional flows was greater in the supratentorial areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005972'>respiratory acidosis</z:hpo> during elevated ICP in the controlled ventilated dogs with a 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> in air gas mixture, reversed the decrease in cerebral flows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the increase in cerebral blood flow during elevated ICP in spontaneously breathing dogs is secondary to the development of hypoxemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005972'>respiratory acidosis</z:hpo> since cerebral vessels retain responsiveness to increased PaCO2 when the vessels are dilated due to elevated ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results also indicate that the regional cerebrovascular response to elevated ICP is non-uniform </plain></SENT>
