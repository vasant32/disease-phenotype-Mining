<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We present the cases of idiopathic, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (HII) in children studied in our hospital over the past 15 years (14 cases), reviewing the clinical features, complementary tests, associated causes, treatment and evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnosis of HII was based on a modification of Ahlskog's criteria (1982) (the child was sedated to avoid increased cranial pressure due to crying): no focal signs, CSF pressure greater than 200 mm of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> composition of CSF and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuro-imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two groups were established according to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first group included those under 24 months old and the second group those over 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences were seen in the presenting, symptoms, neurological examination and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first group the cause of consultation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> and a bulging fontanelle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They recovered after simply restricting fluids and treating the associated cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second group, consultation was for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and sometimes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recovery was satisfactory (except in one case) when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> were added to the above treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The complementary tests carried out depended on the clinical history, general and neurological examination and associated cause (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, vitamin A levels, nutritional index, etc.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A possible aetiological relationship was found in 75% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize the favourable course and good prognosis of HII in infants as compared to adults </plain></SENT>
