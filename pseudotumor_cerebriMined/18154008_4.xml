<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Both idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) in adults and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in children have been shown to involve elevations in venous pressure that resolve once the cerebrospinal fluid pressure is reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been assumed that the venous pressure elevations in both conditions are not hemodynamically significant, but measurement of venous collateral flow in IIH has shown these pressure elevations to be of consequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors used the same methodology to see if the venous pressure elevations noted in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> are important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients with idiopathic childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> underwent magnetic resonance imaging with flow quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of ventricular enlargement, total blood inflow, and superior sagittal/straight sinus outflow was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of collateral venous flow was calculated for each venous territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings were compared with findings in 14 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> the cerebral blood inflow was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and straight sinus outflows were reduced by 27% and 38%, respectively, compared with measurements in controls (p = 0.03 and 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that approximately 150 ml of blood per minute was returning via collateral channels from that portion of the brain drained by the SSS, and 60 ml/minute was returning from collaterals in the deep venous territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Similarly to patients with IIH, children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> show a significant elevation in collateral venous flow, indicating that the same venous pathophysiological process may be operating in both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether or not the ventricles dilate may depend on the differences in brain compliance between adults and children </plain></SENT>
