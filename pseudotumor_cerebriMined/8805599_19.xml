<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The optic nerve, ontogenetically part of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, is surrounded by subarachnoidal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and dura mater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the connection with the intracranial subarachnoidal space, CSF pressure variations influence the optic nerve sheath (ONS) diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologic studies revealed a segment of the optic nerve in which maximal diameter fluctuations could be expected, namely the bulging dura mater region approximately 3 mm behind the papilla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty preparations of optic nerves obtained post mortem were examined sonographically before and after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the ONS, by means of measurement from three different projections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After gelatine-induced widening of the subarachnoidal space, the mean diameter increased by 60% at 3 mm behind the optic nerve head, but only by 35% at 10 mm distance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent measurements by two examiners correlated highly, which indicates excellent reproducibility of the sonographic measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The optimal experimental scanning position was at a right angle to the optic nerve (longitudinal section) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under clinical conditions, however, only axial sections can be obtained using anterior probe positions with transbulbar sound directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using such axial projections the 3 mm position proved reliably reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reduced resolution of the optic nerve itself, allowing it to be distinguished from its surrounding sheath, proved to be somewhat disadvantageous from this projection angle </plain></SENT>
