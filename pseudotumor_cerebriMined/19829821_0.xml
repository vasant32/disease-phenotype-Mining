<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> was revealed by examination of ocular fundus and lumbar puncture, and the absence of other causes, ruled out through a brain scan, led to the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>.Recombinant growth hormone was discontinued and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> started up to 30 mg/kg/die without any clinical improvement but developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The switch to intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (0.4 mg/kg/die) led to a dramatic clinical improvement after only 1 day, then confirmed by examination of ocular fundus and visual evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines for the management of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and even though <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> is recognized as the first-line drug, its efficacy and safety have not been proven: some patients might not respond and others will present unacceptable side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore we suggest the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> is inefficient or intolerable </plain></SENT>
