<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Major neurological impairments and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> are usually prevented by shunt treatment, but minor sequelae may persist or develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The introduction of adjustable shunts has improved the possibilities of optimizing shunt function and minimizing the risk of such impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is still impossible to determine the intracranial pressure without invasive measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings and procedures such as computed tomography (CT) are not always enough to allow a conclusion as to whether a child's signs and symptoms are the result of suboptimal intracranial pressure (shunt dysfunction) or are of another etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the aim of reducing the number of invasive pressure measurements and CT scans, we investigated the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> on the visual evoked response (VER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binocular light flash stimuli of supramaximal intensity were used and VER recordings were performed from Oz and Cz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The VER results from a group of 31 infants and children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and 2 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> were compared with responses from a control group of 35 healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show that a subpotential, P' (P-prime), usually just preceding P1 (P100), had an increased latency ( &gt; 96 ms) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hydrocephalic children before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The P' latency in this group was usually even above 110 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latencies of other VER potentials were also increased but not as consistently as P' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After surgical intervention the VER latencies decreased and usually normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The P' latency in four children in the control group was just above the borderline latency, but was less than 110 ms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
