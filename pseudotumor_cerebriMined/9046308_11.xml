<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A porcine model of regional intracranial pressure was used to compare regional brain tissue pressure (RBTP) changes during expansion of an extradural temporal mass lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurements of RBTP were obtained by placing fiberoptic intraparenchymal pressure monitors in the right and left frontal lobes (RF and LF), right and left temporal lobes (RT and LT), midbrain (MB), and cerebellum (CB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During expansion of the right temporal mass, significant RBTP gradients developed in a reproducible pattern: RT &gt; LF = LT &gt; RF &gt; MB &gt; CB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These gradients appeared early, widened as the volume of the mass increased, and persisted for the entire duration of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study indicates that RBTP gradients develop in the presence of an extradural temporal mass lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest RBTP was recorded in the ipsilateral temporal lobe, whereas the next highest was recorded in the contralateral frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RBTP that was measured in either frontal lobe underestimated the temporal RBTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that if a frontal intraparenchymal pressure monitor is used in a patient with temporal lobe pathology, the monitor should be placed on the contralateral side and a lower threshold for therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> should be adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study provides further evidence that reliance on a single frontal intraparenchymal pressure monitor may not detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas of elevated RBTP </plain></SENT>
