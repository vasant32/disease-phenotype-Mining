<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outpatient department and the clinical research facility based at two separate hospitals within the United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 25 women with body mass index (BMI) &gt;25, with active (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> and intracranial pressure &gt;25 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (over three months) idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women who had undergone surgery to treat idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Stage 1: no new intervention; stage 2: nutritionally complete low energy (calorie) diet (1777 kJ/day (425 kcal/day)); stage 3: follow-up period after the diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each stage lasted three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was reduction in intracranial pressure after the diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary measures included score on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> impact test-6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> (as measured by ultrasonography of the elevation of the optic disc and diameter of the nerve sheath, together with thickness of the peripapillary retina measured by optical coherence tomography), mean deviation of Humphrey visual field, LogMAR visual acuity, and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and three, six, and nine months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lumbar puncture, to quantify intracranial pressure, was measured at baseline and three and six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> variables remained stable over stage 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During stage 2, there were significant reductions in weight (mean 15.7 (SD 8.0) kg, P&lt;0.001), intracranial pressure (mean 8.0 (SD 4.2) cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>, P&lt;0.001), score on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> impact test (7.6 (SD 10.1), P=0.004), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> (optic disc elevation (mean 0.15 (SD 0.23) mm, P=0.002), diameter of the nerve sheath (mean 0.7 (SD 0.8) mm, P=0.004), and thickness of the peripapillary retina (mean 25.7 (SD 36.1) micro, P=0.001)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean deviation of the Humphrey visual field remained stable, and in only five patients, the LogMAR visual acuity improved by one line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Fewer women reported symptoms including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo>, and obscurations (10 v 4, P=0.004; 7 v 0, P=0.008; and 4 v 0, P=0.025, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Re-evaluation at three months after the diet showed no significant change in weight (0.21 (SD 6.8) kg), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> outcome measures were maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Women with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who followed a low energy diet for three months had significantly reduced intracranial pressure compared with pressure measured in the three months before the diet, as well as improved symptoms and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These reductions persisted for three months after they stopped the diet </plain></SENT>
