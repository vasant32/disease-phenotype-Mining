<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience of ES in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our four cases represent associations with ES that have not been previously described in childhood: case 1 was associated with central <z:hpo ids='HP_0000826'>precocious puberty</z:hpo>; case 2 with secondary ES resulting from shrinkage of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">prolactinoma</z:e> during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> therapy; case 3 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>; and case 4 with no significant pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Together, they account for approximately 1 percent of cases of radiographically enlarged sella tursica investigated here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This brings the number of cases of ES reported in children to 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Review of these 27 cases reveals seven with local skull <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and/or a familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remainder lacked clinical homogeneity or similarity to the common adult variety of ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Children with ES did not exhibit the higher female preponderance reported in adults with ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They showed a higher frequency of secondary cases (4/27), and of associated <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> (10/15) and visual (8/17) abnormalities than is seen in adults with the "empty sella." </plain></SENT>
