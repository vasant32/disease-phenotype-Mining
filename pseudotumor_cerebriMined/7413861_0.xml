<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end, 67 neurological patients were examind from whom a total of 208 samples of the cerebrospinal fluid were taken from the Cm and the lumbar region of the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into four groups according to the intensity of the clinical symptons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results obtained in these groups according to the dual samples from the same and from different fluid levels differ from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The differences between the studied indices decrease with the intensification of the clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In case of an increase of th disorders, changes of the indices in a certain directions were also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under consideration of the results of our studies and the conclusions to be drawn for the living system from the second thermodynamic law, the author deals with the clinical aspect of the gasometry of the cerebrospinal fluid as a method that may serve for the determination of the direction of the changes in the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
