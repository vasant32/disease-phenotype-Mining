<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To define the prevalence, natural history, treatment, and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>-related juxtapapillary subretinal neovascular membranes (SRNVMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1140 cases of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, six patients had juxtapapillary SRNVM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients were observed, and their final visual acuities were 20/20, 20/50, and 20/200 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three SRNVM involved the fovea; two of the cases were treated with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser therapy, and one case was treated with photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SRNVM in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is rare (0.53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most cases of juxtapapillary SRNVM are self-limited and regress, can be observed, and have a favorable visual prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The progression of the SRNVM ophthalmoscopically or angiographically toward the fovea, however, might be an indication for laser treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Once subfoveal extension occurs, the visual outcome tends to be unfavorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patients had recurrence of SRNVM after the resolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
