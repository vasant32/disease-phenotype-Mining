<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) which is under control of an autoregulatory system, results from the cerebral perfusion pressure, or CPP being the difference between the mean arterial pressure and ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pathology results in a reduced CBF, that under extreme conditions can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The up-to-date experiments indicate that both the ICP and arterial pressure can be successfully monitored for a quite long period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations make the choice of optimum therapy easier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to some researchers such a monitoring has been introduced as a regular method of the neurosurgical intensive care </plain></SENT>
