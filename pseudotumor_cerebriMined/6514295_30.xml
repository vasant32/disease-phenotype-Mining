<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings of those patients whose visual field or acuity deteriorated were compared with those who did not deteriorate over an average follow-up of 4.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Definite loss of visual function occurred in 49% of eyes and was severe in 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with high grade or atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, or peripapillary subretinal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, were significantly more likely to have had deterioration of visual function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient obscurations of vision and the presence of optico-ciliary shunts were associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo>, older age, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011003'>high myopia</z:hpo> were other risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000529'>progressive visual loss</z:hpo> and, for this reason, BIH is not a benign condition; fundal changes and visual function should be carefully monitored </plain></SENT>
