<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence in the literature to support this concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated this risk by reviewing hospital records of 132 patients who underwent FFB and computer tomography of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-CT) during the same hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients had CT evidence of increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of analysis, patients were divided into two groups: 17 patients had evidence of raised ICP prior to the performance of FFB and had received treatment with an intent to lower the ICP, and 12 patients in whom increased ICP was not suspected at the time of FFB and therefore did not receive any form of pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of neurologic complications in either group during the first postbronchoscopy week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FFB carries a low risk in patients with elevated ICP </plain></SENT>
