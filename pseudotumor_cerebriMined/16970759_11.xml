<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective observational case series studied 51 eyes of 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumour cerebri syndrome</z:e>, by chart review and comparison of preoperative and postoperative examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, VA and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> mean deviation scores improved (P = 0.03) within 6 months when compared with preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that eyes with mean deviation &gt; or = -20 dB were associated with improved or stabilized VA at 6 months, odds ratio 7.5 and confidence interval (1.2, 46.1), P = 0.03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eyes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> defects outside 10 degrees of fixation were associated with improved or stabilized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> at 6 months odds ratio 9.7, 95% confidence interval 1.1, 85.9, P = 0.04 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients developed self-limiting complications from surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Optic nerve sheath fenestration is safe and effective in stabilizing or improving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> and VA in the short to medium term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> loss improved following surgery, and patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> loss stabilized following surgery </plain></SENT>
