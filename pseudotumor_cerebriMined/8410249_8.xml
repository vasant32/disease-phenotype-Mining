<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> response to progressive intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, intracranial pressure (ICP) was raised gradually by continuous expansion of an epidural balloon in seven dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic parameters, ICP, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were monitored continuously and serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels began to rise when CPP was in the low-positive range (20 to 30 mm Hg), reaching a peak just after brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (CPP &lt; or = o mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between ICP and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> peak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to control values, the mean increase was 286-fold for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> and 78-fold for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Temporally, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> peak corresponded well with the observed hemodynamic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in certain parts of the brain stem is responsible for the hemodynamic changes observed in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (such as the Cushing response), and they show that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> play an important role in these hemodynamic changes </plain></SENT>
