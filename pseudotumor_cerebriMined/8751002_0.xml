<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined prospectively 20 patients (11 male, 9 female), aged between 23 and 77 years, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> or rapid increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) of other origin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated, post-traumatic) to evaluate ocular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the increase in ICP was confirmed by computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in 16 patients permanent monitoring of ICP was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 6 had a post-traumatic increase in ICP, and 2 more presented with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 8 patients (40%) presented with intraocular changes; 6 presented with uni- or bilateral intraretinal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, 1 patient had a bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and 1 more patient had bilateral vitreal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When ocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred, the mortality was 2.5 times as high as in patients without ocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For this prognostic feature of the ophthalmological status <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with rapid increase in ICP should be monitored early for intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possibility of intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is elevated in high-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, whereas a rapid increase in ICP also found when the pressure has other causes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated, posttraumatic) </plain></SENT>
