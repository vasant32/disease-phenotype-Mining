<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of the intracranial volume-pressure relations was based on the lumbar infusion test data: intracranial pressure, CSF outflow resistance, volume-pressure response and on CT images numerical analysis (CTINA) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two methods were applied and compared in the study: lumbar infusion test and CT images numerical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The determinations were performed at the balloon volumes of 0.5 ml, 1.0 ml, and 1.5 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First statistically significant changes were found at the balloon volume of 0.5 ml i.e. the increase of CSF outflow resistance and volume-pressure response (data obtained in lumbar infusion test) and the decrease in CTINA values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rise of intracranial pressure was less informative as it was observed at the balloon volume of 1.5 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore CTINA seems to be a very useful noninvasive screening method in clinical studies of intracranial volume reserve </plain></SENT>
