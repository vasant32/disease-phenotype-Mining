<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Visual data on 29 eyes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> who underwent ONSF at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute from 1987 to 1995 were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000529'>progressive visual loss</z:hpo> despite medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity and fields were compared before and after surgery (within 1 and 6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 15.7 months (range, 1-50 months), visual acuity improved in four eyes (14%), was unchanged in 22 (76%) eyes, and worsened in three (10%) eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual fields improved in 10 (48%) eyes, remained unchanged in eight (38%) eyes, and worsened in three (14%) eyes (six were lost in long-term follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were four repeat surgeries in which vision was lost in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data from these patients indicate that ONSF improves or protects visual function in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> who experience deteriorating visual acuity and fields in spite of medical therapy </plain></SENT>
