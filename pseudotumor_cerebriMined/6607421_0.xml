<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The so called slit-ventricle syndrome appears as a potential complication of the CSF derivations, whatever their types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It consists of repetitive episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e>, associated with collapsed ventricles as demonstrated by CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms happen after several months or years during which the derivation worked well, and then get more and more frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between the episodes, the only statement one can do is the slow re-filling of the pump after it has been depressed with finger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The valveless lumbo-peritoneal derivations, and the ventriculo-atrial or ventriculo-peritoneal derivations using a low-pressure valve, are most often found in patients with the slit-ventricle syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that overdrainage of the CSF is likely to be the main cause of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Possible managements comprise: changing the valve, for an other one with a higher opening pressure,--adding to the derivation an antisyphon device, and making a subtemporal decompression </plain></SENT>
