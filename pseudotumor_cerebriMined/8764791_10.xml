<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors studied the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in a population of patients with a documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increase in ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Included in this study were 37 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> elevated ICP due to a spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or craniocerebral trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the ICP was monitored continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fundus examination was performed twice daily on at least 7 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the level and duration of the ICP, the patients were divided into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 1 included 13 patients who had a slightly elevated ICP (range, 20-30 mmHg) on at least 3 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this group, 3 of 13 patients demonstrated venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> on the fifth or sixth day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No swelling of the optic disc was seen in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group 2 included seven patients with an elevated ICP, with values ranging from 30 to 70 mmHg lasting for at least 3 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this group, one patient had a blurred disc margin on the sixth day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Group 3 included 17 patients with shortlasting ICP values, ranging from 30 to 60 mmHg for less than 72 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> nor abnormalities of fundus vessels were seen in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> elevation of ICP is an uncommon event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Its absence does not preclude the presence of ICP elevation </plain></SENT>
