<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/BACKGROUND: To correlate the histopathology of an excised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1282209" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">choroidal neovascular membrane</z:e> (CNV) with the clinical and angiographic findings in a 32-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumour cerebri</z:e> and a peripapillary CNV with subfoveal extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient's visual acuity was assessed by individuals experienced in low vision refraction and who were not members of the surgical team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CNV was excised via a conventional three port vitrectomy with subretinal dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The excised tissue was studied with light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and serial postoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiograms (FAs) and fundus photographs were obtained to study the dissection bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One week after surgery, the FA showed mottled subfoveal choriocapillaris perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three weeks after surgery, this area showed <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelium (RPE) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> clinically, and the FA showed choriocapillaris non-perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six months after surgery, the area of RPE <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and the corresponding area of choriocapillaris non-perfusion had expanded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the excised CNV disclosed hyperplastic RPE, fibrovascular tissue, and no choriocapillaris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fragments of RPE basement were present along the external edge of the specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient's visual acuity did not improve significantly after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Choriocapillaris non-perfusion can develop even in young patients following CNV excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this particular case, it is believed that choriocapillaris <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was caused by incomplete ingrowth of RPE into the dissection bed following RPE removal with CNV excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As far as is known, this is the first report describing the results of surgery for CNV secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumour cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
