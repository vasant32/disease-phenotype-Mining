<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The behavior of the cerebral pial arteries was measured by means of microscopic observation through a cranial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery of each cat was clipped for 1 hour via the transorbital approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five hours after circulation was reestablished in the middle cerebral artery, Evans blue dye was injected intravenously: 30 minutes later, the animal was killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Administration of nimodipine or saline in the treated or control group was started 5 minutes before the middle cerebral artery was clipped and maintained until the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was produced by administration of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> during the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Damage to the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) was judged by extravasation of Evans blue dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Cerebral edema</z:hpo> and infarction were evaluated from histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were most prominent in the control group: the extent of hemisphere affected was as follows (mean +/- standard error): extravasation, 40.5 +/- 8.8%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, 43.2 +/- 5.7%; infarction, 35.5 +/- 9.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the extravasation of Evans blue dye and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> were significantly more extensive in the group treated with nimodipine and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (extravasation, 28.2 +/- 9.6% of the hemisphere; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, 30.3 +/- 7.1%) than in the group treated with nimodipine alone (extravasation, 18.5 +/- 8.7% of the hemisphere; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, 19.4 +/- 6.3%), but the infarction size was similar in both groups (16.6 +/- 4.9% of the hemisphere in the former; 17.0 +/- 6.2 in the latter).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
