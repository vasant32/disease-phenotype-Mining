<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES - To assess the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) and to compare it with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS - Fourty patients diagnosed as IIH and randomly assigned to treatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> or topiramate were assessed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Improvement in the visual fields at the end of third, sixth and twelfth months were taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS - The demographic, clinical features and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure of the two treatment groups were similar at the beginning of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the follow-up visual field grades were compared with the visual field grades at the beginning of the study in each group a statistically significant improvement was detected with both drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the results of the two treatment groups were compared with each other no statistically significant difference was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prominent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was recorded in the topiramate group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS - Topiramate seems to be effective in the treatment of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Weight reduction as well as the reduction of the CSF formation is the possible mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
