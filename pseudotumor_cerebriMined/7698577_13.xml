<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies showing decreased intracranial pressure after hepatectomy in humans suggest that factors released by the necrotic liver could play a pathogenic role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> develop in hepatectomized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats underwent a portacaval anastomosis or a sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, animals underwent a second sham operation or a total hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure was continuously monitored, and cortical water and glutamine contents were measured after the rats were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a second experiment, hepatectomized and devascularized (portacaval anastomosis plus hepatic artery ligation) rats were killed every 2 hours and at the time of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> developed in both groups with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo>, devascularization resulted in a higher brain water content in spite of an equivalent increase in glutamine concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Intracranial pressure increased</z:e> to a similar degree in both groups, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters increased earlier in anhepatic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hepatectomized rats develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The temporal sequence in this model supports the role of glutamine as an organic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25728">osmolyte</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, other factors (e.g., brain volume) may contribute to intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in hepatectomized rats </plain></SENT>
