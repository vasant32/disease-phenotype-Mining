<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has long been recognized that a clinical syndrome similar to idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> can occur secondary to venous sinus obstruction with the elevation in sinus pressure causing a reversal in the pressure gradient across the arachnoid granulations and therefore elevated CSF pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There remains, however, a group of predominantly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> female patients with elevated CSF pressures who have either no apparent abnormality of venous outflow or a tapering, apparently extrinsic compression, of their dominant transverse sinuses on catheter venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests that venous collapse may be associated in some way with the cause of the elevated pressure but clearly something else must be initiating the pressure rise or a circular argument ensues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elevated CSF pressure compresses the veins, which then elevates CSF pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, collapse of the venous sinuses secondary to the elevated CSF pressure once initiated may exacerbate the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the initiating event leading to the elevated pressures in the idiopathic group of patients may be caused by cerebral hyperaemia and cerebral dysautoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0200023'>Priapism</z:hpo> is a condition of pathological elevation of venous pressure of the male genitalia in which there are two forms: (1) venous out flow obstruction and (2) hyperaemia due to a to loss of regulation of blood flow and secondary venous out flow compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Review of the literature suggests the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may be analogous to that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0200023'>priapism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
