<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fetus is exposed to a lower <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that low <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> in postnatal lambs potentiates peripheral vasoconstriction and better maintains cerebral perfusion pressure and CMRO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">Pentobarbital</z:chebi>-anesthetized lambs, 2-7 days old, were ventilated with either room air (n = 7) or a low O2 mixture to reduce arterial O2 saturation to 50% (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevation of intracranial pressure to within 3-5 mmHg of baseline mean arterial pressure for 30 min by ventricular fluid infusion initially caused a similar increase in arterial pressure in the normoxic [11 +/- 3 (SE) mmHg] and hypoxic (14 +/- 2 mmHg) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> increased more rapidly in the hypoxic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, plasma vasopressin levels were substantially elevated by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> alone and failed to increase further with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was no significant difference between groups in the steady-state increase in arterial pressure, and microsphere-determined blood flow to intestines, kidney, skin, and muscle did not decrease in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, cerebral perfusion pressure, regional cerebral blood flow, and CMRO2 were reduced similarly in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, hypoxemia failed to potentiate the postnatal pressor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> is unlikely to be the major mechanism for the potent Cushing response in the fetus </plain></SENT>
