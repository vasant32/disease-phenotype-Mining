<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral oxygenation was assessed by continuous fiberoptic monitoring of jugular bulb <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> saturation, in conjunction with continuous monitoring of arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> saturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Jugular desaturation associated with arterial desaturation (hypoxemic cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>) was evaluated and managed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 121 episodes of combined arterial and jugular desaturation were documented, 76 in the presence of gross abnormalities identified on chest roentgenograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prolonged episodes that did not respond promptly to treatment occurred 32 times in 12 patients, usually after the initial 72 hours posttrauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 89 episodes promptly responded to treatment and occurred predominantly within the initial 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Profound but brief desaturation was not associated with neurological deterioration, while profound and prolonged desaturation was accompanied by significant decreases in Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores, even though intracranial pressure levels were not significantly different in these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Global cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> that does not respond promptly to treatment appears to be independently deleterious to neurological function in severely head-injured patients </plain></SENT>
