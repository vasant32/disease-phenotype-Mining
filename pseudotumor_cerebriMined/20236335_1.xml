<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMRs) are used in large healthcare centers to increase efficiency and accuracy of documentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These databases may be utilized for clinical research or to describe clinical practices such as medication usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of EMR data from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> clinic to evaluate clinician prescription use and dosing patterns of topiramate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study cohort comprised 4833 unique de-identified records, which were used to determine topiramate dose and persistence of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within the cohort, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> was the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> diagnosis (n = 3753, 77.7%), followed by tension-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (n = 338, 7.0%) and cluster or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1565172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias</z:e> (n = 287, 5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physicians prescribed topiramate more often for subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P &lt; .0001) than for those with other conditions, and more often for subjects with coexisting conditions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common maintenance dose of topiramate was 100 mg/day; however, approximately 15% of subjects received either less than 100 mg/day or more than 200 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than a third of subjects were prescribed topiramate for more than 1 year, and subjects with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> were prescribed topiramate for a longer period of time than those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Findings from our study using EMR demonstrate that physicians use topiramate at many different doses and for many off-label indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This analysis provided important insight into our patient populations and treatment patterns </plain></SENT>
