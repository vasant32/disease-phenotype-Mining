<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Demographic data, indications for shunt insertion, time to disconnection, symptomatology, time to retrieval, operative details, length of stay and complications were recorded retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopy was performed using two 5-mm ports and 10-12-mmHg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven children (five boys, two girls) had laparoscopic retrieval of disconnected ventriculoperitoneal (VP; n = 6) and lumboperitoneal (n = 1) shunt catheters between 2006 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age was 8 (5-15) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The indications for shunt insertion were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (n = 4), traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pinealoblastoma</z:e> (n = 1) and idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median interval from insertion to disconnection was 3 (range 1-10) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (n = 3) and neck swelling (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three children were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median referral-to-procedure time was 69 (range 2-224) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One child underwent emergency removal of disconnected shunt with laparoscopic-assisted VP shunt insertion under the same <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One child had a laparotomy as the catheter tip had penetrated the sigmoid mesocolon close to the bowel and could not be safely removed laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining five children, four had the procedure performed as day cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no intra- or post-operative morbidity or subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1141920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">shunt infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Peritoneally migrated shunt catheters have a risk of viscus injury, particularly bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In our experience, laparoscopic retrieval of migrated shunt catheters was safe both as an emergency procedure and electively, when it was performed as a day-case basis in selected patients with excellent outcome </plain></SENT>
