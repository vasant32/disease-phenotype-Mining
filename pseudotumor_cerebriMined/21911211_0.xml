<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic role of axonal transport dysfunction in diseases characterised by sustained pressure elevation have been clearly delineated, however the patho-physiogical mechanisms underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> typified by measurable fluctuations in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> pressure remains unclarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study utilises the rabbit optic nerve, a myelinated, mammalian neuronal tract to compare the effects of sustained pressure elevation and fluctuating pressure change on axonal transport processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 5 rabbits, neural pressure was sustained at 10mm Hg and 40mm Hg in the right and left optic nerves, respectively, for 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another 5 rabbits, neural pressure was modulated between 7.5mm Hg and 57.5mm Hg at 30minute intervals in the right optic nerve, and sustained at 40mm Hg in the left optic nerve for 6hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rhodamine-Î²-isothiocyanate, an axonal transport tracer, was used to quantify axonal transport differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-, high- and fluctuating-pressure nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Axonal transport rates in high-pressure nerves were significantly lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-pressure nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects of fluctuating-pressure and sustained high-pressure on axonal transport processes were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study suggest that the magnitude of pressure elevation and the profile of pressure change over time is important in modulating axonal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also implicates the importance of axonal transport dysfunction in the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
