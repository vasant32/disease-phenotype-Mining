<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pressure is measured from the lateral ventricle or from the subarachnoid space, and each neurosurgical department should establish criteria for determining what level of increased ICP should be acted upon and how it should be managed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review favours a three stage approach: a) determining that ICP is truly elevated and correcting any immediately remediable causes, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e>, then b) first-line measures, which consist of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, osmotherapy and controlled CSF drainage, then c) second-line measures, consisting of short-acting <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> agents--thiopentone and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724">gammahydroxybutyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Future refinements of ICP monitoring will include improved understanding and better methods of measuring intracranial pressure-volume relationships and more detailed analysis of intracranial pulse pressure and the pressure waveform, its changes with mean ICP and its relationship with the arterial pressure waveform </plain></SENT>
