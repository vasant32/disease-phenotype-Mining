<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify complications and interventions resulting from fiberoptic ICP monitoring in a large series of patients with closed head injury (CHI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING/DESIGN: Level I trauma center/Consecutive case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 11,962 consecutive trauma admissions from 1984-1991, 279 patients underwent fiberoptic ICP monitoring for CHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified the last 100 consecutive blunt trauma patients who had received ICP monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight of these patients had charts available and constitute the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined mortality, Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Score (GCS), and admission CT findings for the group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indications, interventions, and complications (<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, and wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>) associated with ICP monitoring were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality for the group was 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reasons for ICP monitoring included GCS &lt; or = 8 and/or abnormal CT findings; 83% had GCS &lt; or = 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Admission CT findings included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (48%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (47%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (31%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (20%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> (18%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one per cent of patients had interventions based on ICP monitoring: osmolar therapy (81%), emergency CT (22%), surgical decompression (3%), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No complications resulted from ICP monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of monitoring was 4 days (maximum 13 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (20%) required two or more monitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reasons for placing a second monitor included duration &gt; 5 days (50%), questionable accuracy (20%), and accidental removal of the first monitor (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1) Fiberoptic intracranial pressure monitoring leads to specific interventions in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>2) The procedure is safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>3) Prospective studies are needed to determine the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> on the safety of fiberoptic intracranial pressure monitoring and to define those factors responsible for the low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate </plain></SENT>
