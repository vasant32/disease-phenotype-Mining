<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pulse sequence was tested on phantoms to evaluate the accuracy, reproducibility and inplane variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the sequence was tested by measuring the self diffusion coefficient of water with different temperatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This phantom study showed that the water self diffusion could be measured accurately and that the inplane deviation was less than +/- 10 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven healthy volunteers were studied with a 10 mm thick slice through the lateral ventricles, clear differences between grey and white matter as well as regional differences within the white matter were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two patients with infarction, alternations in water self diffusion were seen in the region of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Likewise, pronounced changes in brain water self diffusion were observed in a patient with benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that brain water self diffusion can be measured in vivo with reasonable accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical examples suggest that diffusion measurements may be clinically useful adding further information about in vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> tissue characterization </plain></SENT>
