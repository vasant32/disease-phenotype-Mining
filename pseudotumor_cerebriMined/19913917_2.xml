<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> phenotype(s) in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Database study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: We studied 44 consecutive patients with IIH, in addition to 184 women attending the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> clinic of the same medical center and 199 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women participating in the first Israeli national survey on health and nutrition conducted in 1999 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anthropometric parameters were compared with those of 2 control groups of the same age range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight, height, and waist and hip circumference were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty subjects, comprising 91.0% of this cohort, were either overweight (body mass index, 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)) or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (body mass index &gt; or = 30 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean waist circumference was 95.3 cm for IIH, 99.8 cm for the national survey, and 114.5 cm for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> clinic cohort (P&lt;0.001), whereas hip circumference was 121 cm for IIH, 118.4 cm for the national survey, and 125.8 cm (P = not significant) for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> clinic cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Waist-to-hip ratio, a descriptive measure of body fat distribution approximately reflecting upper to lower body fat ratio, was 0.79 in the patients with IIH, 0.84 in the national survey group, and 0.91 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> clinic cohort (P&lt;0.001; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons were adjusted for age and body mass index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In IIH, fat tends to preferentially accumulate in the lower body relative to other <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women of the same range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whereas most complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, are linked to upper body <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, IIH may represent a unique condition potentially induced by nonvisceral fat-related mechanisms </plain></SENT>
