<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of perioperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> on intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients subjected to craniotomy for supratentorial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263885" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cerebral tumors</z:e> were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi>, fentanyl, nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A PaCO2 level averaging 4.8 kPa (median) was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomized to intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> 50 mg or placebo administrated after exposure of the dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICP was measured continuously subdurally with a 22-gauge canula connected to a transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBF and the arteriovenous difference of oxygen (AVDO2) were measured twice, before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>/placebo administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in ICP from 6.5 to 1.5 mm Hg (median) was found after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This decrease was caused by a significant decrease in CBF associated with a significant increase in AVDO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">Indomethacin</z:chebi> did not affect the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, the arteriovenous difference of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, or the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/oxygen index, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> did not provoke global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> group, dura was sufficiently relaxed in eight of nine patients and dura was opened without the occurrence of cerebral swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one patient, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> treatment was necessary to prevent dural tightness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> supplemented with <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> was applied in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that perioperative treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> is an excellent treatment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during normocapnic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia for craniotomy </plain></SENT>
