<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) in the assessment of patients with neuro-ophthalmologic disorders, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A modified Humphrey field analyzer was used to perform standard automated perimetry and SWAP, a technique that isolates the activity of short-wavelength-sensitive ("blue") mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty patients (80 eyes) were evaluated by SWAP and standard automated perimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (26 eyes) had recovered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> and/or multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, 15 (30 eyes) were in various stages of treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, and 12 (24 eyes) had other miscellaneous neuro-ophthalmologic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six additional patients (12 eyes) with neuro-ophthalmologic conditions were tested twice on different days during a 2-week period, with the order of SWAP and standard perimetric testing being reversed on the second day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 80 eyes tested, 38 (48%) had SWAP visual fields that were worse than standard automated perimetry results; 29 (36%) showed no difference between standard and SWAP visual fields; and 13 (16%) had standard automated perimetry results that were worse than SWAP visual fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 26 eyes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> and/or multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, 15 (58%) had SWAP results that were worse than standard visual fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten (33%) of the 30 eyes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> had SWAP results worse than standard automated perimetry results, and 13 (54%) of 24 eyes with miscellaneous neuro-ophthalmologic conditions had SWAP results worse than standard automated perimetry results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the 12 eyes undergoing repeated testing, SWAP visual fields were worse when they were performed last, perhaps indicating that some <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> effect was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was observed for standard visual fields as well, but to a smaller extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings suggest that SWAP may be useful in detecting certain neuro-ophthalmologic deficits more readily than standard automated visual field testing, especially for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further evaluations will be necessary to define the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> for SWAP visual fields in neuro-ophthalmologic disorders </plain></SENT>
