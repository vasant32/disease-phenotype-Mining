<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of the Italian pediatric experience with the multicentric Gruppo Italiano per le Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA)-Italian Pediatric Hematology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (AIEOP) "AIDA" (ATRA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi>) trial are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 983 patients with APL enrolled in this protocol between January 1993 and June 2000, 124 (13%) had younger than 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of ATRA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> induction followed by 3 polychemotherapy consolidation courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular response by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was assessed after consolidation and patients who were PCR- were randomized for different maintenances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seven children were eligible and evaluable for induction: 103 (96%) achieved a hematologically complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overt ATRA syndrome was observed in 2 patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> was observed in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four patients were evaluable for RT-PCR analysis at the end of consolidation: 91 (97%) proved PCR+ and 3 PCR- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) are 89% (95% confidence interval [c.i.]: 83%-95%) and 76% (c.i.: 65%-85%), respectively, at more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis of greater than 10 x 10(9)/L had a significant impact on EFS (59% vs 83% at 10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results highlight the efficacy and feasibility of the AIDA protocol in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279641" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric APL</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
