<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) who had marked bilateral disc swelling as part of his initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This occurred in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP), with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition and cell content, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We discuss the possible mechanisms which could lead to disc swelling in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and conclude that the raised ICP and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> in our patient were the result of poor absorption of CSF into the dural venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose that the very high white cell count (WCC) led to a hyperviscosity state which resulted in poor absorption of CSF and in so doing, created a clinical picture of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) </plain></SENT>
