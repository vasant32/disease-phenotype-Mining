<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine by cerebral venography and manometry in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> the cause of the previously demonstrated venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the superior sagittal and proximal transverse sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral venous sinus pressure was measured before and immediately after C1-2 puncture with removal of 20 to 25 mL of CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lowering the intracranial pressure by lateral C1-2 puncture during manometry has shown that the venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> resolves immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These studies indicate that the venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is due to compression of the transverse sinuses by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> and not due to a primary obstructive process in the cerebral venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
