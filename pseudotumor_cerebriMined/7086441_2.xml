<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014008" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">empty sella syndrome</z:e> is a result of chronically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> in the presence of a congenitally deficient diaphragma sellae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whilst the intracranial pressure in two of the five patients was abnormally high, in three patients in whom it was monitored, the CSF pressure was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although these cases may represent "burnt out" forms of intracranial pressure problems, it might be that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pulsations of CSF are sufficient to produce the empty sella in the presence of a deficient diaphragma sella </plain></SENT>
