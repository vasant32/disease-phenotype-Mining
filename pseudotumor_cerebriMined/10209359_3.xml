<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the same time, there was a recurrence of the PTCS which had been in remission for more than one-and-a-half years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite treatment with high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, intravenous immunoglobulins and repeated cerebrospinal fluid drainage, both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700251" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brachial plexopathy</z:e> and the PTCS continued to worsen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both lumbosacral plexuses became involved and the visual acuity deteriorated to a level such that a lumboperitoneal shunt had to be inserted </plain></SENT>
