<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Involvement of cranial nerves other than II and VI is very uncommon in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH); peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015464" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">facial nerve palsy</z:e> is exceptional and has rarely been described in the context of treatment with ATRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a 15-year-old female patient with APL who developed an IIH and involvement of cranial nerves (bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, left facial and right sixth nerves) after receiving induction therapy including ATRA </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptoms completely subsided with the temporary withdrawal of ATRA and did not recur after reintroducing the drug </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we report an atypical presentation of IIH that merits consideration, especially with respect to young patients with APL receiving ATRA; our most important observation is that the drug could be safely reintroduced once the symptoms had resolved </plain></SENT>
