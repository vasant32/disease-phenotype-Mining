<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three outcome groups were defined: complete recovery, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the early postimmersion phase (first 72 h), CPP was consistently above 50 mm Hg in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were occasional, nonrepetitive, and easily controllable ICP spikes above 15 mm Hg in three patients from each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeated ICP spikes above 15 mm Hg were observed in some patients with adverse outcome only after 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successful control of ICP and CPP did not ensure intact survival, and sustained late intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is more likely a sign of profound neurologic insult rather than its cause </plain></SENT>
