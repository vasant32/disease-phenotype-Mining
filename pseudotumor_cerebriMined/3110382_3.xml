<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Animal investigations suggest that administration of hyperosmolar total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions may potentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> following head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous nutrition (TPN) is often required after head injury due to intolerance to enteral feeding (EN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the effect of TPN on intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements in severely brain-injured patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six severely brain-injured patients were randomly assigned to receive TPN or EN and were studied from hospital admission until 18 days postinjury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TPN was started within 48 hours postinjury and the EN was started when tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peak daily ICP was not significantly different on admission and over time (overall mean +/- standard error of the mean 32.01 +/- 1.62 for TPN versus 32.5 +/- 1.25 for EN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure was greater than 20 mm Hg in 75% of TPN patients and 73% of EN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional therapy failed to control elevated ICP in 36% of TPN patients and 38% of EN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, subsequent <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy failed to control ICP in 56% of TPN patients and 64% of EN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum osmolality was not significantly different between groups at admission or over the course of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The TPN group tended to have higher mean serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels for the first 13 days postinjury, while the EN group had a higher mean serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> content thereafter, but these differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study shows that TPN can be given safely to the severely brain-injured patient without causing serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperosmolality</z:e> or affecting ICP levels or ICP therapy </plain></SENT>
