<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no linear correlation between the CSF protein and opening pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, low CSF protein (less than 20 mg/dl) was present in only 26% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings fail to confirm previous reports of an inverse relationship between the CSF opening pressure and CSF protein as well as low CSF protein in these patients </plain></SENT>
