<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The dissociation of cardiovascular (arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) and respiratory (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>) reactions to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> seems to be inconsistent with the usual cooperative behavior of the two systems and their role in managing disturbances in the central chemical environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study the Cushing reaction was elicited by transient increase of the intracranial pressure 4-11 times in each experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pressor response and changes in the vertebral sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) were compared with the respiratory reaction and with changes in the phrenic nerve activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reaction in both nerves developed in two phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the phrenic nerve, an initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> (increased discharge amplitude and frequency) coincided with augmentation of the rhythmic SND (phase 1) and complete nerve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> developed when the SND was desynchronized (phase 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transition in both systems correlated in their latencies and the severity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> needed for their stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Repetition of the ischemic stimuli increased the occurrence of the respiratory-related rhythmicity in the SND and later changed its character from rhythmic amplitude modulation to respiratory-related high-frequency bursting SND coinciding with the inspiration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that, despite the apparent dissociation between the cardiovascular and respiratory reactions, there is a parallel response between the neurophysiological correlates of the two systems to increasing severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
