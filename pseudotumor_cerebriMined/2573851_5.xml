<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative diffusion measurements were obtained using single spin echo pulse sequences with pulsed magnetic field gradients of different magnitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the diffusion images showed an increased diffusion in various brain regions when compared with the diffusion coefficients for corresponding regions in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 3 pseudotumour patients the increased self diffusion was localized to the periventricular regions, while 4 patients had increased diffusion in the whole brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate the presence of increased brain water content both intra- and extracellularly suggesting that patients with pseudotumour have two defects of pathogenetical significance: intracellular water accumulation and increased resistance to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow leading to an interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
