<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> is a not very common syndrome in the pediatric age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate in about 1:100.000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of PTC is usually good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sometimes however, PTC could be complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye diseases</z:e> such as reduction of visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our case is a child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> and with a bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> of the papilla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of PTC was possible after the physical examination and the instrumental exams (EEG, brain NMR and others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the staying in the hospital the child performed a therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3077">betamethasone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>; the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> improved and the bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> of the papilla started to be less evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The child was discharged in good health and with a planned ocular follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We think that the Pediatrician must considered the possibility of the presence of a PTC; that is an important syndrome not only for the Neurologist </plain></SENT>
