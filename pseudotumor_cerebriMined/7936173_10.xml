<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A velocity-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phase-mapping method was used for non-invasive study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in the cerebral aqueduct, for indirect calculation of supratentorial CSF production, and for measurement of blood flow in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 12 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumour cerebri</z:e>), and 10 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The peak caudal and rostral CSF flow in the aqueduct during the cardiac cycle did not differ significantly between the patients and the volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between the CSF volume flow amplitude and the resistance to cerebrospinal fluid outflow in the patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The calculated mean supratentorial CSF production rate was 0.79 ml/min in the patients and 0.70 ml/min in the controls, but this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the MRI measurements suggested CSF hypersecretion in three patients, whereas increased transependymal passage of CSF could have been the cause of negative calculated CSF production rates in two others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A tendency towards lower mean blood flow in the SSS (mean 345 ml/min) in the patients than in the controls (mean 457 ml/min) was found, and in two patients showed very low values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We showed that MRI phase-mapping may be used to study the relative importance of the pathophysiological factors thought to play a role in the development of IIH </plain></SENT>
