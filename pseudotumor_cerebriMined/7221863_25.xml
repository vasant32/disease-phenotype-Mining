<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Isotope cisternography was performed and the patency of the dural sinuses verified by direct sinography or phlebography or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same procedure was used to study 6 other patients suffering from disorders leading to the same type of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 16, our results confirm a defect in CSF absorption mechanisms linked to an abolition of the pressure gradient between CSF and sagittal sinus in 6 patients, as well as an important increase in CSF resistance to drainage in 10 others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite this defect, the CSF circulation was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in most patients (10 of 12) as demonstrated by isotope cisternography </plain></SENT>
