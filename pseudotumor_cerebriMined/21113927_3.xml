<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks represent a significant challenge due to frequent association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) and higher risk of surgical failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study objective was to review management strategy and identify factors associated with need for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and/or ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chart review performed from 1999 to 2009 at a tertiary-care medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 105 patients underwent CSF leak repair; 39 patients (37.1%) were treated for spontaneous CSF leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 57.7 years and 33 were female (85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average body mass index (BMI) was 38.5 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common sites were cribriform plate (51%), sphenoid lateral pterygoid recess (31%), and ethmoid roof (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent endoscopic repair utilizing image guidance with multilayered closure in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients (12.8%) developed recurrent CSF leak with mean ICP of 27.0 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>, compared to 25.0 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> for those without recurrence (P = .33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had successful rerepair at mean follow-up of 2.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> was used in nine patients, whereas six patients underwent VPS placement for elevated ICP management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) was statistically associated with need for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> or VPS (P &lt; .001), whereas elevated ICP reached borderline significance (P = .049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Management of spontaneous CSF leaks requires a comprehensive strategy after endoscopic repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of BIH may be associated with requirement of further ICP treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Close ICP monitoring, coupled with selective use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and VPS, may decrease risk of failure </plain></SENT>
