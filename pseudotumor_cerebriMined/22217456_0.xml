<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>Increased body mass index</z:mp> (BMI) has been associated with increased risk of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), but the relationship of BMI to visual outcomes in IIH is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult cases of IIH satisfying the modified Dandy criteria seen at our institution between 1989 and 2010 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographics, diagnostic evaluations, baseline visit and last follow-up examination data, treatment, and visual outcome data were collected in a standardized fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups were compared, and logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship of BMI to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, evaluating for interaction and controlling for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 414 consecutive IIH patients, 158 had BMI ≥40 (World Health Organization <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> Class III) and 172 had BMI 30-39.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with BMI ≥40 were more likely to have severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> at first neuro-ophthalmology encounter than those with a lower BMI (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in 1 or both eyes at last follow-up among those patients with BMI ≥40 (18% vs 11%, P = 0.067) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression modeling found that 10-unit (kilogram per square meter) increases in BMI increased the odds of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> by 1.4 times (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.91, P = 0.03) after controlling for sex, race, diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our finding of a trend for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> associated with increasing BMI suggests that very <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> IIH patients should be closely monitored for progression of visual field loss </plain></SENT>
