<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two major (one superior and one inferior) <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venous and arterial calibers were measured before and 1.1 +/- 0.1 months, 3.2 +/- 0.2 months, 5.0 +/- 0.2 months, 7.6 +/- 0.2 months, and 13.0 +/- 1.9 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venous caliber decreased significantly, and the decrease progressed until 3.2 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The venous caliber in the contralateral unoperated eyes also decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decrease in the venous caliber in the contralateral unoperated eye as well as in the operated eye following the surgery supports the hypothesis that slow filtration is the mechanism of successful optic nerve sheath decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> venous caliber measurement, in either the operated eye or the unoperated fellow eye, can be used to quantitatively monitor the status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
