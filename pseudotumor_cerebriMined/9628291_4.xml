<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three males and one female, aged between 10.5 and 14.2 y, developed intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> within 2 weeks to 3 months of starting treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A national database, OZGROW, has been prospectively collecting data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3332 children treated with rhGH in Australia and New Zealand from January 1986 to 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of BIH in children treated with growth hormone (GH) is small, 1.2 per 1000 cases overall, but appears to be greater with biochemical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e> (&lt;10 IU ml(-1)), i.e. 6.5/1000 (3 in 465 cases), relative risk 18.4, 95% confidence interval 1.9-176.1, than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other children on the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner's syndrome</z:e> was 2.3/1000 (1 in 428 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No cases in patients with partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e> (10-20 IU ml(-1)) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Possible causative mechanisms are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors' practice is now to start GH replacement at less than the usual recommended dose of 14 IU m(-2) week(-1) in those children considered to be at high risk of developing BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmological evaluation is recommended for children before and during the first few months following commencement of rhGH therapy and is mandatory in the event of peripheral or facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> or visual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> does not exclude the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
