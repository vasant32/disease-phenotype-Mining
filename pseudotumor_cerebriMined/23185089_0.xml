<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e>, mostly large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, had very substantial radiological signs of mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were also studied following surgical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A number of significant changes in the wave V and Vn latency/intensity and less so amplitude/intensity function was found in the 27 patients, compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers, as well as those studied pre- and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar MBP changes had been noted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers placed in a dependent head position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible mechanisms to explain these findings are discussed.  The MBP methodology shows promise and further development could make neuro-intensive care unit monitoring practical </plain></SENT>
