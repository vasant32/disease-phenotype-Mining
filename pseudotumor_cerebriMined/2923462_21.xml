<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of 107 cases of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and measured raised intraventricular pressure were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty one children had recently been diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and the remainder had had shunts injected to direct the cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common symptoms in the group were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, behavioural changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical signs were inappropriately increasing occipitofrontal head circumferences, tense anterior fontanelles, splayed sutures, and distension of the scalp veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Half the infantile cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> were without symptoms, and a quarter of the cases with cerebrospinal fluid shunts and measured raised intraventricular pressure were without signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no fewer than 33 different clinical signs including several unusual ones, such as macular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We believe that the presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> with raised intraventricular pressure is sufficiently variable, unusual, or even absent to justify the direct measurement of intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
