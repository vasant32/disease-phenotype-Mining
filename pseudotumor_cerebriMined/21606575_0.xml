<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the characteristics and nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with PTCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 10 patients diagnosed with PTCS who were cognitively tested at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each cognitive test, "Borderline deficit" (BD) was defined as a score more than 1 standard deviation (SD) below and "Definite Deficit" (DD) as a score more than 2 SD below the mean for age, sex and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each cognitive domain, impairment was defined as a single test score more than 2 SD below the mean, or scores of more than 1 SD below the mean for age, sex and education in &gt; 50% of tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 43.4 Â± 13.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>8/10(80%) patients were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3/10(30%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>; 3/10(30%) had significant cerebral venous outflow obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Impairment was most commonly seen and was most severe in the WMS logical memory I (BD-44%, DD-44%), WMS logical memory II (BD-37.5%, DD-50%), RAVLT delayed recall (BD-30%, DD-40%) and RAVLT retention(BD-40%, DD-30%) tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of cognitive domains revealed impairment in memory and learning (80%), executive function (10%), visuo-spatial skills (30%), and language (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that patients with PTCS can have significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, particularly in learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence needs to be studied in a larger cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The relationship of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> with chronically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressures</z:e> and its role in contributing to patient morbidity needs to be investigated further </plain></SENT>
