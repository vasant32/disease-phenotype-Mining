<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of an empty sella was significantly high in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (4/4; P&lt;0.0001) and nevoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> syndrome (3/5; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratio of an empty sella in children, excluding patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and nevoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> syndrome, is estimated to be 4/345 (1.2%), which is markedly lower than that in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland in children could provide important clues for the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or nevoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
