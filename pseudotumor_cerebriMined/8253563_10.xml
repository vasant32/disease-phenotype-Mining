<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of these patients will require a second RND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sacrifice of both internal jugular veins (IJV) has been felt to lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) with subsequent neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 1987 to 1991 four patients had staged bilateral RNDs at the West Virginia University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these patients a subarachnoid bolt was placed to directly monitor ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Jugular bulb, mean arterial, pulmonary artery, and central venous pressures were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients demonstrated elevations in ICP immediately on head rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further marked elevations were noted immediately after IJV ligation with a maximum peak at 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pressure levels of greater than 40 mm Hg were observed in three of four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Systemic hypertension</z:hpo> was observed in response to elevated ICP (Cushing's reflex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients studied recovered from surgery without significant sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Within 24 hours the ICP had returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three patients required intraoperative intervention to lower their ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that even in a staged second RND there are significant rises in ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These are to a level that suggests emergency medical intervention is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We feel that when the second IJV is sacrificed an increase in ICP should be anticipated, monitored, and treated accordingly </plain></SENT>
