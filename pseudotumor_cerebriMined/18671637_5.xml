<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The subarachnoid space around the optic nerve in the orbit can be visualized using T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging with the fat-saturation pulse sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The optic nerve sheath (ONS) diameter can be estimated by measuring the outer diameter of the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dilated ONS is associated with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and is believed to reflect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between dilated ONS and ICP is unclear because of the difficulty in obtaining noninvasive measurements of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the relationship between subdural pressure measured at the time of surgery and ONS diameter measured on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> subdural fluid collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients underwent bur-hole craniostomy with continuous drainage for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206620" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hygroma</z:e> in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Orbital thin-slice fat-saturated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were obtained before and after surgery, and the ONS diameters were measured just behind the optic globe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subdural pressure was measured using a manometer before opening of the dura mater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between the ONS diameter and the subdural pressure (correlation coefficient 0.879, p = 0.0036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ONS diameter before surgery (6.1 +/- 0.7 mm) was significantly reduced after surgery (4.8 +/- 0.9 mm, p = 0.003; measurements are expressed as the mean +/- standard deviation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased ONS diameter measured on coronal orbital thin-slice fat-saturated T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images is a strong indicator of increased ICP, and helps to differentiate between passive subdural fluid collection due to brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and subdural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206620" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hygroma</z:e> with increased ICP </plain></SENT>
