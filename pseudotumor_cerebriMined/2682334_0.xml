<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The newly designed needles were held with an adaptor to any kind of Leksell's, Patil's, UT's, Sugita's, or Komai's stereotactic equipment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inner tubes were arranged parallel with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One was an irrigation tube of 0.1 mm in inner diameter, the other was a suction tube of 2 mm in outer diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blood clot was sucked through a window of the outer tube by the aspirator and incarcerated there soon after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incarcerated blood clot was crushed by a small streak of saline solution from the nozzle of the irrigation tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Crushed clot and fluid were sucked through the suction tube </plain></SENT>
