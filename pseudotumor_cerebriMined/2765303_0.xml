<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, they do not mention the findings of CT cisternography and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We intend to investigate the mechanism of CSF dynamics in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0394006" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disequilibrium syndrome</z:e> by means of these radiological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 31 year-old woman who had suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> for 18 years was found to have prominent increase of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (18.1 mg/dl) and BUN (127 mg/dl) 3 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At that time, digital marking of the skull was already present by X-ray examination without other destruction in bone survey of the whole body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She was hemodialysed by the hollow fiber kidney three times weekly (dialysis time 4.5 hours, dialysate osmotic pressure 270 mOsm/kg <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three months ago, she began to complain of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> 2 hours after the beginning of dialysis, so that she was referred to Kosei Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On admission, she showed exophthalmus, concentric narrowing of the visual field, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>hyperreflexia</z:hpo> in jaw and four extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After admission, she received hemodialysis therapy thrice weekly (dialysis time 5 hours, dialysate osmotic pressure 290 mOsm/kg <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the same time, 200 ml of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> (contents of glycerin 10, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> 5, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> 0.9%) was administered intravenously during dialysis, which ameliorated the symptoms of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Laboratory studies revealed marked decrease of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, BUN and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels and osmotic pressure, and increase of blood pH at the time of postdialysis compared with predialysis </plain></SENT>
