<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multivariate clinico-physiologic-therapeutic aspects are presented and discussed, and a proposition is made for ventilatory optimization under circumstances of predominantly diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A novel technique is introduced for practical, bedside quantification of ventilatory adjustments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique allows simultaneous optimization of intracranial pressure and global cerebral extraction of oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter represents therapeutic coupling between global cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism </plain></SENT>
