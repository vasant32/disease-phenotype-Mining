<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that puberty is a risk factor for poorer visual outcome in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective chart review case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Setting: Tertiary referral center, neuro-ophthalmology unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient population: Ninety-six patients with IIH followed for a minimum of one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Observation: Age (grouped into prepubertal, pubertal, teenage, or adult), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, initial intracranial pressure (ICP), measurements and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> were correlated with final visual outcome using chi(2), stepwise logistic regression, and model-selection log linear analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures: Visual outcome was graded into "excellent" -- no evidence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> or any permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo> in either eye, "moderate"-- evidence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> and/or a mild (nasal constriction) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo>, or "poor outcome" (peripheral constriction) -- permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Outcome data were complete for 96 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moderate to poor visual outcome, as opposed to excellent, was significantly associated with puberty (P = .007 using the gender-specific definition of puberty, .0002 using the broad definition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moderate-poor visual outcome occurred in none of seven IIH patients of prepubertal age (&lt;9 years), in 15 of 26 patients presenting between nine to 16 years, in two of six patients aged 17 to 22 years, and in seven of 57 adult patients over the age of 23 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this series of 96 patients with IIH, visual outcome was less favorable in pubertal patients than in prepubertal, teenage, and adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We recommend that clinicians maintain a high index of awareness when caring for pubescent children with IIH </plain></SENT>
