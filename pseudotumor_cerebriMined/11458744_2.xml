<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination found no abnormalities except bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging demonstrated enlargement of the lamina cribrosa foramina through which the olfactory nerves pass, as well as empty sella and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cerebral cortical atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral densitometry showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ and blood parathyroid hormone levels were elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF pressure was 280 mmH2O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral frontal craniotomy was performed to expose the anterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Foraminal enlargement at the lamina cribrosa was confirmed, and islands of extra-osseous calcifications on the arachnoid membrane were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The base of the anterior fossa was repaired intradurally with fascial graft and fibrin glue on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No CSF leakage was noted at 1-year follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous CSF leakage probably resulted from enlargement of the foramina at the lamina cribrosa due to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ mobilization from bones and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> not to the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> caused by poor CSF absorption at the arachnoid granulations obliterated by extra-osseous calcareous accumulation </plain></SENT>
