<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Placement of a VA shunt in patients with narrowing or occlusion of the central veins presents considerable difficulty because few imaging modalities exist to safely and reliably insert a guidewire or atrial catheter past the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the use of intraoperative venography to guide the placement of the distal portion of a VA shunt in a patient with a valve blocking the left brachiocephalic vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> and a left ventriculoperitoneal shunt presented with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed with partial distal shunt obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of a history of failed attempts at ventriculoperitoneal shunting, conversion to a VA shunt via the left internal jugular vein was planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: Surgery was performed by using the standard technique until resistance was encountered when inserting a guidewire into the internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative venography of the central veins was performed, which showed a large valve blocking progression of the guidewire in the left brachiocephalic vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.035-inch guidewire was successfully directed through the vein past the obstruction and exchanged for a peel-away introducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The distal shunt catheter was then inserted, and the correct position in the atrium was confirmed fluoroscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When obstruction of the central veins is found during a VA shunting procedure, intraoperative venography is a useful method to aid in the placement of the atrial catheter through the central veins </plain></SENT>
