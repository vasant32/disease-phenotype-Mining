<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, which is often fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The control of intracranial pressure (ICP) is therefore crucial for further therapeutic strategies in space-occupying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, aggressive treatment strategies such as hemicraniectomy have not been described in a larger series of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the clinical course and outcome in six patients who developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> received maximum medical treatment for elevated ICP, but with signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo> emerging, hemicraniectomy was performed to control ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a very severe encephalitic syndrome and were treated over the course of weeks in the neurocritical care unit (NCCU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients recovered almost completely and showed only mild or no neurologic deficit when reexamined after 4 months to 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hemicraniectomy should be considered in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> as a potentially lifesaving therapeutic measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the initial neurologic deficit seems to have no impact on the long-term clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
