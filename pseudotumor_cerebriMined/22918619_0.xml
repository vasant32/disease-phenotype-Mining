<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The current surgical management strategies for refractory cases of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) remain unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the outcome of our paediatric patients who were offered a CSF diversion procedure in order to control their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical notes of the patients under 16 years of age, who presented in our centre from 2005 to 2010, with a confirmed diagnosis of IIH, and ultimately had a lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe their immediate postoperative course, shunt-related complications and recent outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients presented at a mean age of 8.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two presented with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and had a shunt acutely; the remaining five presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and were shunted within 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the immediate postoperative period two patients experienced low-pressure symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients required shunt revisions; in total 15 revisions took place, mainly secondary to symptomatic overdrainage or obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 26 months, two patients have diminished visual acuity at least on one side; only one patient became <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>-free, despite resolution of the CSF pressure post diversion in four out of the six remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients required shunt revisions and 6/7 (85.7 %) had persisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> at their last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is apparent that once functional, the LPS seems adequate to lower the CSF pressure but not effective in eliminating symptoms </plain></SENT>
