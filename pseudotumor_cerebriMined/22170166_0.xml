<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) requires proper documentation of raised CSF opening-pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In childhood results may not be reliable due to insufficient sedation/<z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> or drug effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the current practice regarding pain and stress management in children undergoing lumbar puncture (LP) for pressure measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A one-year survey was conducted involving 368 German paediatric departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children with newly diagnosed PTC should be reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Details analyzed here included: age, sex, CSF opening pressure and type of procedural sedation and <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> (PSA) during LP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 61 patients were analyzed, aged 6 months to 17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>29 patients (47%) did not receive any kind of PSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In children receiving PSA the following regimens were used: Ketamine; Midazolam; Ketamine + Midazolam; Midazolam + Piritramide; <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi>; Profofol + Midazolam; general anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pain and stress management in children undergoing LP for CSF opening pressure measurement is often insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pain, stress and the variability of PSA regimen may be confounders of pressure measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In order to prevent false diagnoses of PTC and to obtain comparable results at different centers, a general consensus on PSA in children undergoing LP for CSF opening pressure measurements is required </plain></SENT>
