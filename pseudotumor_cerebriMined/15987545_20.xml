<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo>, a major risk factor for idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), is rapidly increasing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages of the United States population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied trends in the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts for IIH in the United States between 1988 and 2002, using a national hospital discharge database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample and robust weighted least-squares regression, adjusted for stratified survey methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 2779 admissions for CSF shunting procedures (new or revision) in IIH patients in the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality for new shunts was 0.5% (0.9% for ventricular shunts and 0.2% for lumbar shunts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated total United States caseload of CSF shunting procedures for IIH increased 350% between 1988 and 2002 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(The 2002 United States caseload was 1370 admissions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New shunt placements increased 320% during this interval (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In some subpopulations in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is less important as a risk factor for IIH, caseload increases were less marked: pediatric IIH shunting (age &lt; 13 yr) increased 52% and shunting in male IIH patients increased 38%, but shunting in older patients (age &gt; 44 yr) increased 240% during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bariatric procedures (e.g., gastric bypass) increased very rapidly in incidence since 1998, with nearly 200 such procedures performed on IIH patients in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of CSF shunting for IIH is increasing in the population of the United States at about the same relative rate as morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Studies to establish the best shunting method in IIH and to explore alternative treatment strategies, such as optic nerve sheath fenestration and bariatric surgery, are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
