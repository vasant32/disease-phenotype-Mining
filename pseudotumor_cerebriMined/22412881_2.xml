<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify demographic characteristics, concomitant morbidities, and perioperative factors associated with hospital readmission following bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report on a prospective observational study of 24,662 patients undergoing primary RYGB and 26,002 patients undergoing primary AGB at 249 and 317 Bariatric Surgery Centers of Excellence (BSCOE), respectively, in the United States from January 2007 to August 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected using standardized assessments of demographic factors and comorbidities, as well as longitudinal records of hospital readmissions, complications, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The readmission rate was 5.8% for RYGB and 1.2% for AGB patients 30 days after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The greatest predictors for readmission following RYGB were prolonged length of stay (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-2.7), open surgery (OR, 1.8; CI, 1.4-2.2), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (OR, 1.6; CI, 1.1-2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prolonged length of stay (OR, 2.3; CI, 1.6-3.3), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (OR, 2.1; CI, 1.3-3.3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> (OR, 1.5; CI, 1.1-2.1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OR, 1.5; CI, 1.1-1.9) were associated with the greatest increases in readmission risk for AGB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality rate was 0.14% for RYGB and 0.02% for AGB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Readmission rates are low and mortality is very rare following bariatric surgery, but risk for both is significantly higher after RYGB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Predictors of readmission were disparate for the two procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results do not support excluding patients with certain comorbidities since any reductions in overall readmission rates would be very small on the absolute risk scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future research should evaluate the efficacy of post-surgical managed care plans for patients at higher risk for readmission and adverse events </plain></SENT>
