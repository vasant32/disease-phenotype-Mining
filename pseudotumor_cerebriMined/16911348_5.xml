<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is characterized by abnormal elevation of intracranial pressure without any underlying etiologic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> is the major clinical finding whereas neuroradiological imaging findings are almost always <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this preliminary study was to determine if diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging in patients with IIH might be beneficial in the management of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospectively, we evaluated standard magnetic resonance, magnetic resonance angiographies and venographies, diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance findings of 16 patients with IIH and of 16 age-, sex-, and weight-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with IIH underwent a detailed neuroophthalmologic examination and lumbar puncture for evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was performed with 1.5 T equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On physical examination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had characteristic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, varying degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid pressure was higher than 250 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant decrease in cerebral blood flow in six patients, whereas insignificant increase in two were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood volume values were almost similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group's values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant mean transit time prolongation was found in six patients as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is a clinical syndrome which requires prompt diagnosis and a thorough evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment is crucial for preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and improving associated symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is also important to detect cerebral perfusion changes, as cerebrovascular complications may be associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although our patient group is small for statistical evaluation, it is a preliminary study using perfusion and diffusion magnetic resonance which may contribute to IIH management </plain></SENT>
