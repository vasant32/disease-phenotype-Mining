<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) remains a poorly understood and therapeutically challenging disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enthusiasm has emerged for endovascular therapy with stent reconstruction of dural sinus narrowing (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DSN</z:e>); however, a complete understanding of the hydrodynamic dysequilibrium is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: To review and characterize catheter manometry findings including pulsatility changes within the venous sinuses in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Cases of venous sinus stent implantation for IIH were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Three cases of venous sinus stent implantation for treatment of IIH are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases demonstrated severe narrowing (&gt;70%) within the transverse sinus, and a high pressure gradient across the lesion (&gt;30 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stent implantation resulted in pulsatility attenuation, correction of pressure gradient, and improvement of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: We report the finding of high venous sinus pulsatility attenuation after stent implantation for dural sinus narrowing and propose the hypothesis that this finding is a marker of advanced dural sinus incompetence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This characteristic may be useful in identifying patients who would benefit from endovascular stent remodeling </plain></SENT>
