<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of epidemiology, diagnostic work-up, therapy, and clinical follow-up in 53 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified several important aspects to be considered in the management of these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, patients may present without obvious symptoms at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> might not or not yet be present in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Third, measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure may not always be reliable due to drugs used for sedation, which may alter intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourth, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF pressure values in childhood are not well established and diagnosis might even be justified if pressure is &lt;20 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifth, associated conditions are frequent (at least in our cohort); however, in most cases, a causative link cannot be proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, disease relapse is a serious problem (20% in our group), which stresses the importance of standardized follow-up programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PTC constitutes an important and possibly underrecognized disorder in children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering the high percentage of possibly associated conditions in our study, a detailed diagnostic work-up is crucial to identify treatable underlying conditions </plain></SENT>
