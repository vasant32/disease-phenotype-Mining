<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>Increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypertonic saline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (HSD), a hyperosmotic, hyperoncotic resuscitation solution, decreases ICP in trauma resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that HSD would decrease ICP, reduce brain water, and reduce intravascular fluid requirements during bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve swine were divided into two bypass groups: Group 1 (ISO = isotonic) received as prime 1 L of lactated Ringer's solution and 500 mL of 6% hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 2 (HSD = hypertonic saline/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>) received as prime 1 L of lactated Ringer's solution, 500 mL of 6% hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi>, and 1 mL/kg of 24% hypertonic saline/25% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Normothermic bypass was instituted at 100 mL.kg-1.min-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ICP increased significantly during bypass with ISO prime but not with HSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain water in the cerebrum did not differ between groups but was reduced in the cerebellum to 75.9% +/- 1.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that HSD prevented any significant increase in ICP during normothermic bypass, and substantially improved fluid balance during bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cardiac surgery patients in whom maintaining decreased ICP and reducing isotonic fluid administration is important, HSD may be a useful addition to the bypass prime solution </plain></SENT>
