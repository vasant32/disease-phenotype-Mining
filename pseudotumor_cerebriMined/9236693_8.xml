<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP), due to infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, on the process of myelination has been suggested in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study 19 hydrocephalic infants were followed-up with anterior fontanelle pressure (AFP) measurement (assessment of ICP), MRI (assessment of the myelination process and the CSF volume), and neurodevelopmental testing (NDT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a high correlation (r = 0.80) between the myelination and NDT scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The size of the CSF volume showed a poor correlation with the mean AFP, the degree of myelination and the NDT scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a significant correlation between the mean AFP and the degree of myelination (r = 0.67) and also between the mean AFP and the NDT scores (r = 0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Longer-term follow-up (mean = 27 months) showed a significant correlation between the early progress of myelination and later developmental level (r = 0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the children with a severely delayed myelination, preoperatively, showed a recovery of myelination following CSF drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that: (1) raised ICP is related to developmental outcome, through the process of myelination; (2) the delay in myelination can be (partially) reversible; and (3) CSF volume is of minor importance regarding neurodevelopment </plain></SENT>
