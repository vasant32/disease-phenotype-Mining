<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report 4 pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> patients with optic nerve elevation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Four pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> patients found to have optic nerve elevation on ophthalmologic examination at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical record review of 117 pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> patients aged 0 to 18 years was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were seen at the University of Wisconsin pediatric ophthalmology clinic between 1995 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, optic nerve appearance, and neurologic work-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four (3.4%) of 117 Down syndrome patients seen at the university's pediatric ophthalmology clinic were found to have optic nerve elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This included 2 boys and 2 girls, aged 2 to 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or transient visual obscuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the patients had high <z:hpo ids='HP_0000540'>hyperopia</z:hpo> at the time of presentation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were referred for neurologic evaluation of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) based on a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, an elevated opening cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure on lumbar puncture, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF analysis results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient's elevated optic nerve appearance was likely secondary to PTC after obtaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain MRI results; however, this patient did not undergo a lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One child with PTC demonstrated improvement in visual acuity and optic nerve appearance after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 2 additional patients with PTC were treated with either low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> therapy and experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The final patient, who did not undergo lumbar puncture, experienced spontaneous resolution of optic nerve elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up duration was 49 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Only 3.4% (4/117) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> children were found to have optic nerve elevation in a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> should be considered in asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> patients with elevated optic nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Medical therapy in PTC with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> can lead to improvement in visual acuity and optic nerve appearance, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> also was seen </plain></SENT>
