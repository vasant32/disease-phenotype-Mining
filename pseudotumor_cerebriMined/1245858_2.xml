<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first effect on breathing was a stimulation which was followed at higher pressures by irregularity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and periods of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> at high intracranial pressure (ICP was rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Raised ICP did not consistently depress the ventilatory response to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> until ventilation during airbreathing was already depressed; therefore, we cannot experimentally justify applying this test clinically to detect incipient ventilatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When hypoxemia developed during raised ICP, it was compatible with the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002791'>hypoventilation</z:hpo> due to central <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of breathing; thus, there was no evidence of a neurally mediated effect on the lungs, causing defective gas exchange </plain></SENT>
