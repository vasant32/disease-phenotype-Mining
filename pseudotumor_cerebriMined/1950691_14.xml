<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT scan, Doppler sonography, and angiography were done routinely at the time of admission and CT was repeated 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial treatment consisted of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, low-molecular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intensive care including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> and intracranial pressure monitoring was instituted in cases of deteriorating level of consciousness and considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> as visualized on the primary or repeat CT scan </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, only 6 patients were without significant neurological or neuropsychological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were moderately disabled and 6 were severely disabled </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A number of demographic, clinical and radiological variables were investigated for a possible prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A grading scale was developed for each variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the initial neurological deficits, degree of motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, gaze deviation, and decreased level of consciousness correlated with an unfavourable result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>While the prognostic significance of each of these individual variables was only moderate, the combined score of these 3 variables correlated better with outcome (r = 0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>More advanced age was found to correlate with a less favourable prognosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
