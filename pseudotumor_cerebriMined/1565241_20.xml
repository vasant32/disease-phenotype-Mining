<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had 155 examinations up to 15 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most patients, the disturbances of CSF hydrodynamics persisted for many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified at least two mechanisms for the development of the increased CSF pressure: a rise of sagittal sinus pressure, probably explained by extracellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> causing partial compression of the major venous sinus (type 1), or a low conductance with a compensatory increase in CSF pressure in order to sustain the bulk flow (type 2) </plain></SENT>
