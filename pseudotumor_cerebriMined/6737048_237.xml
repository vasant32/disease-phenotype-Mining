<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements were made in 75 adult patients with closed head injuries (mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score 6.2) using the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 intravenous injection method with eight detectors over each hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were studied acutely within 96 hours of trauma, and repeatedly observed until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or recovery (total of 361 examinations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteriojugular venous oxygen differences (AVDO2) were obtained in 55 of the patients, which permitted assessment of the balance between metabolism and blood flow, and provided estimates of cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on mean regional CBF, the patients were classified into two groups: those who exhibited hyperemia on one or more examinations, and those who had a consistently reduced flow during their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illness. "Hyperemia" was defined as a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or supernormal CBF in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, a definition that was independently confirmed by narrow AVDO2's indicative of "luxury perfusion" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients showed a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in CMRO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients (55%) developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hyperemia with an average duration of 3 days, while 34 patients (45%) consistently had subnormal flows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although more prevalent in younger patients, hyperemia was found at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age levels (15 to 85 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a highly significant association between hyperemia and the occurrence of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, defined as an intracranial pressure above 20 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with reduced flow showed little or no evidence of global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, but instead revealed the expected coupling of CBF and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CBF responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> were generally preserved, with the hyperemic patients being slightly more reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients with reduced flow, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> resulted in wide AVDO2's suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
