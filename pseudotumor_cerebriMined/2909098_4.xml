<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women with a mean age of 27 years (range, 17-41 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six healthy women volunteers with a mean age of 33 years (range, 25-46 years) were studied for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six patients had elevated opening pressures at lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging demonstrated a partially empty sella in two patients, and one patient had signal aberration in the dural venous sinuses suggestive of slow flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no white matter signal abnormalities, even in the periependymal space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Volumetric pixel analysis revealed significantly larger subarachnoid space volumes in patients than in control subjects, without a significant difference in ventricular volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other intracranial abnormalities were found in any IIH patient or control subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that, in IIH, (a) although the subarachnoid spaces are enlarged, the wide range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values would limit the clinical use of these measurements and (b) the role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, as with CT, is primarily in the exclusion of other diseases with clinical presentations similar to that of IIH </plain></SENT>
