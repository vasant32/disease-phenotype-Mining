<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present data on cerebral microdialysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients which were obtained in an ongoing study supported by the German Ministry for Education and Research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far, 50 patients have been included who required critical care due to massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By correlating the microdialysis results with follow-up CT scans, we could define the neurochemical characteristics of three different brain compartments: (1) noninfarcted brain tissue with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> microdialysis values, (2) brain areas adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core which were not hypodense in CT scans but caused reversible neurochemical alterations, and (3) the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core with massive concentration changes which did not normalize over the measuring period of 3 to 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microdialysis values averaged over time and correlated with initial PET scans helped to describe neurochemical predictors of a malignant, i.e., life-threatening, space-occupying course of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We discuss the value of this method in guiding therapy and predicting clinical outcome in the context of other neurological critical care disorders and describe the pros and cons of cerebral microdialysis as an invasive monitoring technique </plain></SENT>
