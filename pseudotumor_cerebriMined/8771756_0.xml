<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resistance of liquor resorption was enhanced in 82% of cases, suggesting impaired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liquor outflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increased brain elasticity gradient suggests the exhaustion of cerebrospinal compensatory potentialities and correlates with the increased liquor resorption resistance </plain></SENT>
