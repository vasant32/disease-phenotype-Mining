<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a stenosis of the transverse sinus has been observed in many IIH patients, the role this feature plays in IIH is in dispute </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that IIH may be caused by a sufficiently collapsible transverse sinus, but it is also possible that a stenosed sinus may persist following resolution of significant intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
