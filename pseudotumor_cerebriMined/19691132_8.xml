<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of metabolomic biomarker profiles in neurological conditions (idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) and cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) compared to controls with either no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> or mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spectra of CSF (n = 87) and serum (n = 72) were acquired using (1)H NMR spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate pattern recognition analysis was used to identify disease-specific metabolite biomarker profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The metabolite profiles were then used to predict the diagnosis of a second cohort of patients (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF metabolite profiles were able to predict diagnosis with a sensitivity and specificity of 80% for both IIH and MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> serum metabolite profile was 75% sensitive and specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On analysing the second patient cohort, the established metabolite biomarker profiles generated from the first cohort showed moderate ability to segregate patients with IIH and MS (sensitivity:specificity of 63:75% and 67:75%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that NMR spectroscopic metabolic profiling of CSF and serum can identify differences between IIH, MS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Metabolomics may, therefore, have the potential to be developed into a clinically useful diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The identification of disease-unique metabolites may also impart information on disease pathology </plain></SENT>
