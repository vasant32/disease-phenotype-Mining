<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To continuously evaluate the relationship between global systemic and cerebral oxygenation during temporary profound <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp>, which was attempted for prompt management of posttraumatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, intervention study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Neuroscience intensive care unit of a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Young adults (n = 21) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain trauma, undergoing routine monitoring of jugular bulb and pulmonary artery <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> saturations, along with other monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In 102 multivariate observations carried out on days 2 and 3 post-trauma, two new physiologic variables were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These variables, systemic-cerebral oxygenation index and the systemic-cerebral ventilatory index, were evaluated in terms of baseline and post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, when intracranial pressure was largely increased, this increase was associated with decreased cerebral oxygen extraction ("luxury perfusion"), and high values of systemic-cerebral oxygenation index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In response to transient profound <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp>, the cerebral oxygen extraction normalized (increased), as did the systemic-cerebral oxygenation index (decreased), under most circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The systemic-cerebral ventilatory index showed adequate systemic-cerebral response to <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> in 92 (90.2%) observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the remaining ten (9.8%) observations, this response was considered inadequate, but it did not result in abnormal systemic or cerebral oxygenation parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In young adults with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain trauma who require prompt management of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, transient profound <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> is effective in lowering the intracranial pressure, as well as in offsetting the cerebral luxury perfusion, while improving or maintaining adequate systemic oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The systemic-cerebral oxygenation index and the systemic-cerebral ventilatory index are potentially useful, physiologically monitorable variables for the combined assessment of global systemic and cerebral oxygenation in a variety of areas involving physiologic and/or therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
