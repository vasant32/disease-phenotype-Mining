<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results for 168 eyes showed that sequential follow-up testing with the Fieldmaster correctly identified progression or regression of visual field loss in more than 94% (34 of 36) of the eyes with visual field changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Fieldmaster correctly determined no change in visual field characteristics for 99% (131 of 132) of the eyes with stable visual fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the Fieldmaster is an excellent device for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo>, and also has some capabilities for monitoring progression or regression of visual field loss </plain></SENT>
