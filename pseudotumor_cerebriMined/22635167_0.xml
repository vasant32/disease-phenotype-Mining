<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> is the mainstay of medical therapy for idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its use in pregnant women has not been recommended because of reported teratogenic effects in rodents and rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> use during human pregnancy remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the pregnancy and offspring outcomes in women with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IH) treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Data were collected through questionnaires sent to patients with IH and their physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The questionnaires focused on IH diagnosis, obstetric history and outcomes, and pediatric outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: A total of 101 women with IH were consented (total of 158 pregnancies) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> usage before 13 weeks of gestation was reported in 50 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> was similar to the control group and no major complication was identified in the offspring of women treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: There is no convincing evidence for an adverse effect for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> use in human pregnancy, even when prescribed prior to the 13th week of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While the liberal use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> should be avoided during pregnancy, this medication should remain a treatment option in pregnant women when clinically indicated </plain></SENT>
