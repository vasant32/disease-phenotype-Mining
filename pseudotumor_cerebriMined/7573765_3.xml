<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An 12-old-year girl with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040381" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Tolosa-Hunt syndrome</z:e> (THS) complicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She suffered from alternating, recurrent and painful <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> at the age of 8, and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> which did not affect visual acuity was also recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>THS subsided readily on steroid therapy, and the remission lasted more than 3 years after discontinuing steroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> did not change despite remission of THS, and resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> with a mildly enlarged <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotoma</z:hpo> and 10% decrease in visual acuity 6 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI disclosed slightly contrasted masses in the bilateral enlarged cavernous sinuses and narrowing of the left carotid siphon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another small mass with partial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement was revealed adjacent to the left narrowing of the carotid siphon in the optochiasmatic cistern; however, there was no lesion causing intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intracavernous MRI findings were considered characteristic of THS, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> seemed to be due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> by exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since subsequent MRI confirmed no progression of the above findings, the intracavernous and intracisternal masses were suspected to be non-specific inflammatory granulomas associated with THS </plain></SENT>
