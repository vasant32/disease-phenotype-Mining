<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is a picture characterized by elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure that may cause some different complications including optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and visual accuracy alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although treatment is generally pharmacological, invasive therapeutical techniques such as optic nerve sheath fenestration and lumboperitoneal shunt are sometimes required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter one is a technique that usually provides good results with a low complication rate, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, mechanical failure and overdrainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 40 year-old female patient with an idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> picture who required a lumboperitoneal shunt due to her progressive deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a few hours, the patient developed an intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and some days later she developed a venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These two complications, although described in the literature, are very unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even though the lumboperitoneal shunt is a safe technique with good results, it is not exempt from complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We alert about the need to take into account <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as possible complications in the followup of these patients </plain></SENT>
