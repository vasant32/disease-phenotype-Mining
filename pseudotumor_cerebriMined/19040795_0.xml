<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distal (venous) catheters of VA shunts have historically been inserted using a cut-down on the internal jugular vein (IJV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Less invasive placement of atrial catheters may minimize operative times and attenuate post-operative incisional discomfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a method for atrial catheter placement using ultrasound guidance to visualize the IJV and facilitate percutaneous venous puncture in 17 adult patients (23 total insertions) undergoing treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IJV and carotid artery were visualized by ultrasound in 23 (100%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Venous penetration and successful atrial catheter placement was achieved on the first attempt in 23 (100%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>Pneumothorax</z:hpo>, carotid artery puncture or need for venous cut-down occurred in no cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The utilization of ultrasound guidance for distal VA shunt catheter insertion may increase comfort with this procedure and ultimately decrease complication rate and operative time </plain></SENT>
