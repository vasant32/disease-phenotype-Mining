<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these, 29 patients were also assessed for systemic arterial pressure and epidural intracranial pressure, so that a correlation between cerebral perfusion pressure and the Doppler ultrasonography waveforms could be established </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With increasing intracranial pressure, the transcranial Doppler ultrasonography waveforms exhibited different characteristic high-resistance profiles with first low, then zero, and then reversed diastolic flow velocities, depending on the relationship between intracranial pressure and blood pressure (that is, cerebral perfusion pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study shows that transcranial Doppler ultrasonography may be used to assess the degree of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This technique further provides a practicable, noninvasive bedside monitor of therapeutic measures </plain></SENT>
