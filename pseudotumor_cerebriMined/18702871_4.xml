<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, several complications are reported with this treatment the most serious and life threatening being <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">Retinoic Acid</z:chebi> Syndrome (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed at identifying factors that could predict complications caused by ATRA during induction treatment of APL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Forty-two patients with confirmed APL (by t(15;17) and/or PML/RARA) treated at our institution (University hospital of Tunis) between January 1998 and June 2006 using two consecutive protocols: European APL93 trial (24 patients) until February 2004 and Spanish PETHEMA LPA99 trial (18 patients) more recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction regimen consisted of ATRA 45 mg/m(2)/d until CR combined to DNR 60 mg/m(2)/d x 3+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">Cytarabine</z:chebi> 200 mg/m(2)/d x 7 (APL93) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">Idarubicin</z:chebi> 12 mg/m(2) d2, 4, 6, 8 (LPA99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">Prednisone</z:chebi> (0.5 mg/kg d1-d15) was added if WBC &gt;10 x 10(9)/L to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> 99 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age was 36 yr (7-64 yr), M/F=16/26 (0.61), median WBC was 2.4 x 10(9)/L (range 0.6-100 x 10(9)/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WBC &gt;10 x 10(9)/L was noted in 14 patients (33%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients achieved CR (78.57%):18/24 (75%) in APL93 versus 15/18 (83%) in LPA99 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complications due to ATRA were: <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (10), Scrotal ulcerations (3), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet syndrome</z:e> (2), Perineal ulcerations (1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors for complications of ATRA (Fisher exact test) were: BMI &gt;35 (p=0.055), induction treatment without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (LPA99 trial) (p=0.047), whereas age (p=0.74), gender (p=0.51), initial WBC (p=0.47), and additional cytogenetic abnormalities (p=0.83) were not predictive </plain></SENT>
