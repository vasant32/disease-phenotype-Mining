<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective review of 15 patients with a variety of neurological injuries at our institution, it was found that aggressive management of respiratory, hemodynamic, metabolic and neurological status was required with the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A scoring system to determine the amount of interventions and nursing care required was used in the review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) demonstrated that with the acuity of illness, there were predictably increased interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a method for quantifying the amount of care in this group of individuals, scoring of the interventions before, during, and after <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings demonstrated a significant difference in the scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean scores were: pre-treatment = 31.8, s.d. = 7.5; during = 41.7, s.d. = 2.0; post-treatment = 36.4, s.d. = 5.2, p &lt; 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further modifications of the TISS to include current neuroscience therapies, such as the monitoring of cerebral oxygen extraction by jugular bulb catheterization, may increase the utility of the TISS </plain></SENT>
