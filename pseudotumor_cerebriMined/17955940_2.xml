<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to similarities in symptoms and their time evolution, it has been hypothesized that some of these conflicts are related to the development of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in these individuals in microgravity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This hypothesis was tested using a validated mathematical model that embeds the intracranial system in whole-body <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This model was used to predict steady-state intracranial pressures in response to various cardiovascular stimuli associated with microgravity, including changes in arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and blood colloid osmotic pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The model also allowed alterations of the blood-brain barrier due to factors such as gravitational unloading and increased exposure to radiation in space to be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Simulations predicted that intracranial pressure will increase significantly if, combined with a drop in blood colloid osmotic pressure, there is a reduction in the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in microgravity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: These results suggest that in some otherwise healthy individuals microgravity environments may elevate intracranial pressure to levels associated with benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, producing symptoms that can adversely affect crew health and performance </plain></SENT>
