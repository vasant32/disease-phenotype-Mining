<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral venous outflow obstruction and elevated intracranial venous pressure may play an etiological role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined jugular valve insufficiency as a potential factor contributing to intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Jugular venous valve function was assessed bilaterally by duplex sonography in 20 consecutive patients with diagnosis of IIH and in 20 healthy controls matched for age, gender and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of valvular insufficiency was based on reflux duration during a controlled Valsalva maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracranial venous outflow was evaluated in 11 patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography in 10, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a principle result, valvular insufficiency was significantly more frequent in patients with IIH (70 vs. 30%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding was associated with irregular leaflet structures on B-mode imaging (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bilateral insufficiency was more frequent in the patient group which, however, was not significant (p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, sinovenous outflow obstruction was found in five of six patients that had undergone contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography and DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The detection rate was inferior in phase-contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (one of five patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study gives evidence that valvular insufficiency may play a causal role in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is a major risk factor for the disease and weight reduction leads to improvement of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Possibly, increased intra-abdominal pressure is transmitted into the intracranial venous system, causing intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Jugular valve insufficiency may facilitate pressure transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As transverse sinus stenosis was a concomitant finding, these factors may be complementary </plain></SENT>
