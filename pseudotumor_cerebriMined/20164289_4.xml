<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to establish the incidence and timing of its occurrence, identify predisposing factors, characterize the clinical presentations and their severity, and examine the effects of treatment in patients who underwent surgery for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study was conducted at two tertiary care centers: The University of Virginia and the National Institutes of Health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We conducted a retrospective review of 941 surgeries for CD (723 adults, 218 children) to identify patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> after surgery for CD and examine the associated clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven children (four males, three females; 3%), but no adults, developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent resection of an ACTH-secreting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, and postoperative serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> reached a nadir of less than 2 microg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were placed on tapering <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within 3-52 wk, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients experienced symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> and had ophthalmological examination demonstrating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> from a unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848209" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">VIth nerve palsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients were still on steroid replacement at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In three patients, a lumbar puncture demonstrated elevated opening pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients were treated successfully with a lumbar puncture, steroids, and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients did not receive treatment, and their symptoms resolved over several months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001578'>hypercortisolism</z:hpo> (24-h urinary free <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>) before surgery and the likelihood of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> after surgery (P &lt; 0.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This series demonstrates a 3% occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> in children after successful surgery for CD, but the absence of the syndrome in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> manifests itself within 1 yr of surgery, often while patients are still undergoing replacement steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A patient exhibiting signs of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> after surgery for CD should undergo an evaluation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Recognition of the symptoms and treatment should correct and/or prevent ophthalmological sequelae </plain></SENT>
