<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>35 patients were transported from the intensive care unit (ICU) and 15 from the accident and emergency department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physiological variables were recorded every minute in the four hours before transfer (ICU group only), during the move, and for four hours afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretransfer insults were predictive of further insults during and after transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was significant correlation between increased frequency of insults post-transfer (compared with pre-transfer) and high injury severity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A greater proportion of the patients transported from the emergency department had secondary injuries post-transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adequate resuscitation before moving the patient, especially in patients with multiple injury, is important </plain></SENT>
