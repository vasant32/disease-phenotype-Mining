<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, the aqueductal flow in HC was about 10 times larger and the cervical flow was half as large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In BIH the CSF flows were not different from those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decreased arterial expansion as reflected in the reduced cervical flow in HC may be due to pathologic changes in the arteries and paravascular spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The large aqueductal flow in HC reflects a large brain expansion, causing increased transcerebral mantle pressure gradient and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In BIH there is a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain expansion (aqueductal flow) and consequently no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is argued that BIH be caused by an obstruction on the venous side, as opposed to the vascular alterations in HC, which are on the arterial side </plain></SENT>
