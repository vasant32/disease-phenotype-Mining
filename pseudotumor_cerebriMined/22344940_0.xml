<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the relationship between LD placement and CSF leak recurrence after endoscopic repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective case series was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent CSF leak repair from 1999 to 2010 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data collected included demographics, body mass index (BMI), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) or idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0006888'>meningoencephalocele</z:hpo>, etiology and site of leak, LD placement, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> and antibiotic use, recurrence, and site of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation between LD placement and leak recurrence was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 105 patients underwent CSF leak repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 68 patients had an LD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 68 patients, 15 (22%) had a recurrent leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 105 patients, 37 did not have an LD, and 5 of the 37 (14%) recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrence rates with and without LD were not significantly different (p = 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 105 patients, 40 (38%) had a spontaneous leak, 15 (14%) had a traumatic leak, and 50 (48%) had an iatrogenic leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the spontaneous group, 30 of 40 patients had an LD and 10 of 40 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was not significant between these subgroups (p = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LD was used in 11 of 15 patients with traumatic leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of these 15 patients, 4 did not have a drain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was not significant between these subgroups (p = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In 27 of 50 patients with an iatrogenic leak, an LD was placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Of 50 patients, 23 did not have an LD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical significance when the recurrence rates for these subgroups were compared (p = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our study, there was no association identified between LD placement and recurrence rates after endoscopic repair of CSF rhinorrhea </plain></SENT>
