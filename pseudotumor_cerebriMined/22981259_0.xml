<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the etiological and clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Materials and method: We performed a comprehensive analysis of epidemiology, diagnostic work-up, therapy, and clinical follow-up in 42 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: Totally 42 patients diagnosed with PTC [27 (64.3%) females and 15 (35.7%) males] were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average age of the symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 10.79Â±3.43years (range from 12months to 17years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was found in eleven (26.2%) of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients had familial mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, two of them had posttraumatic PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following diseases were one patient, respectively; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil-induced PTC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypervitaminosis</z:e> A induced PTC, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> induced withdrawal due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268732" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nephritic syndrome</z:e>, use of oral contraceptives, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018378" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Guillain-Barre syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0586989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">varicella-zoster virus infection</z:e> and dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common symptom was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, recorded in 76.2% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated medically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients in our group also required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> is an avoidable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, both in adults and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pre-pubertal <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> girls are more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Medical therapy appeared to be successful in treating pediatric PTC in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, despite adequate treatment, children can rarely experience loss of visual field and acuity; thus, prompt diagnosis and management are important </plain></SENT>
