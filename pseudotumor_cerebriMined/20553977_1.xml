<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> may be involved in intracranial pressure regulation, but cerebrospinal fluid (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) and plasma concentrations in this disorder are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated venous and intrathecal concentrations of ANP, BNP and CNP precursor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in 40 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and in 20 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Natriuretic pro-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were quantitated using processing-independent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In CSF, no differences in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations between patients and controls were found (proANP: 239 + or - 23 vs 231 + or - 22 pmol/L, proBNP: &lt;2 pmol/L in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, proCNP: 1079 + or - 318 vs 1138 + or - 323 pmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In plasma, proCNP was lower in IIH compared with controls (35.3 + or - 4.8 pmol/L vs 43.8 + or - 5.9 pmol/L, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, plasma proBNP was significantly lower in patients compared with controls (47.1 + or -21.4 pmol/L vs 59.2 + or - 22.0 pmol/L, p = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no associations between <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations and ICP and BMI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma proANP and proCNP increased during 3 months follow-up (p=0.01 and p=0.006), n=12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that decreased plasma proCNP concentration in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may reflect endothelial dysregulation of vascular tone and may be a marker in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies of proCNP and endothelial function are needed to establish such role </plain></SENT>
