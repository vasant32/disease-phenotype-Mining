<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the pathogenesis remains unknown, some association was found with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the extracranial venous drainage was not systematically evaluated in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study compared extracranial cerebral venous outflow in eight IIH patients and eight control subjects using magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) Venography and flow measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the study identified extracranial factors that affect cerebral venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In six of the IIH patients, either complete or partial functional obstruction of the internal jugular veins (IJVs) coupled with increased venous outflow through secondary venous channels was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On average, a four-fold increase in mean venous flow rate through the epidural and/or vertebral veins was measured in IIH patients compared with the healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one of the healthy subjects, intracranial venous outflow was studied also during external compression of the IJVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over 40% of the venous outflow through the IJVs shifted to the epidural veins and intracranial pressure, measured noninvasively by MRI, increased from 7.5 to 13 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings from this study suggest that increased ICP in some IIH patients could be associated with increased extracranial resistance to cerebral venous outflow </plain></SENT>
