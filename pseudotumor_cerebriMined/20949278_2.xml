<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables quantification of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layer thicknesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies evaluating the ability of OCT to identify and quantify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> are few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim was to evaluate the applicability of peripapillary OCT evaluation in an unselected, consecutive series of patients with confirmed idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study of 20 patients with newly diagnosed IIH and 20 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were evaluated by means of direct ophthalmoscopy, masked evaluations of fundus photography, peripapillary <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), and peripapillary average <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickness (PART) measurements (Stratus OCT-3, fast RNFL 3.4 protocol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OCT evaluation of PART revealed the highest number of patients (n = 20) with optic disc abnormalities in either eye (90%), compared with 85%, 80% and 70% for RNFLT measurements, direct ophthalmoscopy, and fundus photography respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a linear association between means and differences of OCT data (RNFLT, PART) with a slope of 0.54 (SE 0.025), p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Peripapillary OCT is a promising objective examination modality for optic disc evaluation in IIH, and may improve the identification of subtle disc swellings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Underestimation of RNFLT for increasing severities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledemas</z:hpo> is suspected, making PART a more reliable parameter compared to RNFLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future larger validation studies are needed </plain></SENT>
