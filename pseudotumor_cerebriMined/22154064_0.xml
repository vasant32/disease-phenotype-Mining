<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Common presenting symptoms include <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo>, a neck mass, hearing loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo>, leading to changes in taste, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001605'>vocal cord paralysis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, and sternocleidomastoid/trapezius <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> (A </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surg Neurol 1979; 11:83-94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This patient was found to have a jugular foramen mass after presenting with the unusual constellation of visual changes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A jugular foramen mass in a young woman was discovered after presenting with visual changes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>; the patient was found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> on initial examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Otologic and head and neck examination were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent imaging demonstrated a mass at the right jugular foramen with compression of this structure; a contralateral transverse sinus stenosis was also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This latter abnormality (along with obstruction of the jugular foramen) impeded venous drainage leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and visual changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In a patient presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> with an associated jugular foramen mass, a multidisciplinary approach benefits the patient with input from interventional neuroradiology, neurosurgery, and neuro-ophthalmology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Venous outflow was compromised through the left stenotic transverse sinus, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> outflow on the right side through the jugular bulb was impeded by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>; obstructions of both led to symptomatic impeded venous outflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This compromise in venous outflow led to an increase in superior sagittal sinus pressure, with subsequent increase in intracranial pressure and resultant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to increase blood flow, an angioplasty was performed on the patient's affected transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, symptomatology consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> prompted the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> for medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>After both therapies, the patient's symptoms dramatically improved and were stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> has also remained stable, with no immediate need for surgical resection, stereotactic radiation, or consideration of an intraluminal transverse sinus stent placement or shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The unique presentation of a jugular foramen mass in a young woman leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> highlights the need for high clinical suspicion of potential etiologies necessary for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Despite the benign nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017925" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">her disease</z:e> process, an unusual constellation of anatomical factors lead to the need for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intervention </plain></SENT>
