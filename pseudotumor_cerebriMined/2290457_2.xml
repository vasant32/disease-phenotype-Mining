<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>10 patients were selected and carefully analyzed according to Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale (GCS) scores and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that DMSO rapidly reduces the raised ICP, increases the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and improves the neurological course and outcome without affecting the systemic blood pressure and patient responsiveness except only in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also point out that the rebound effect does not occur </plain></SENT>
