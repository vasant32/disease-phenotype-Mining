<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixty-seven infants received three doses of either 25,000 IU of vitamin A or a placebo at about 6.5, 11.8 and 17.0 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trained physicians examined each of the infants on days 1, 2, 3 and 8 after supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine infants (10.5%) supplemented with vitamin A had episodes of bulging of the fontanelle compared with two infants (2.5%) in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 14 episodes occurred in infants supplemented with vitamin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these 12 episodes, none occurred with the first dose, 3 occurred with the second and 9 with the third dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The higher incidence of bulging of the fontanelle in the vitamin A group relative to the placebo group and its temporal association with the vitamin A doses are suggestive of a causal association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding that increased numbers of vitamin A doses were associated with a higher probability of bulging of the fontanelle suggests a cumulative effect </plain></SENT>
