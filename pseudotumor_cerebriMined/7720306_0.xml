<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed 22 LPS studies performed on 15 patients during the past 2 years and correlated the findings with the patency status of the shunt as determined by brain CT/MRI and surgical revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients also had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen studies were performed in patients with LPS for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>) and 7 were performed in patients with LPS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After intrathecal administration of 0.5-1 mCi of In-111 DTPA, sequential 1 minute images of the abdomen were obtained for 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Static images of the abdomen were then obtained at 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours with imaging of the head at 4 and 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> patients with partial obstruction had tracer activity in the peritoneal cavity with little or no shunt tubing visualization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had marked penetration of the tracer into the lateral ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> patients with partial obstruction also showed tracer entry into the peritoneal cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Shunt tubing and tracer extravasation into the needle tract, at the site of lumbar puncture was seen only in patients of PTC, probably because of high intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the tracer flowed quickly into the basal cistern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with PTC, it entered the lateral ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete shunt obstruction was characterized by nonvisualization of activity in the peritoneal cavity and flow of the tracer into the basal cistern within 1 hour after injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
