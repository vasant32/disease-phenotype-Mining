<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Robotic applications hold great promise for improving clinical outcomes and reducing complications of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, however, there have been few widespread applications of robotic technology in neurosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that image-guided robotic placement of a ventriculostomy catheter is safe, highly accurate, and highly reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen patients requiring catheter ventriculostomy for ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt or reservoir placement were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent image-guided robotic placement of a ventricular catheter, using a preoperatively defined trajectory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> catheters were placed successfully in a single pass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no catheter-related <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and no injuries to adjacent neural structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean distance of the catheter tip from the target was 1.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean operative times were 112 minutes for VP shunt placement and 42.3 minutes for reservoir placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean operative times decreased over the course of the study by 49% for VP shunts and by 19% for reservoir placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The robotic placement of a ventriculostomy catheter using a preplanned trajectory is safe, highly accurate, and highly reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This makes single-pass ventriculostomy possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, even in those with very small ventricles, and may permit catheter-based therapies in patients who would otherwise be deemed poor surgical candidates because of ventricle size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Robotic placement also permits careful preoperative study and optimization of the catheter trajectory, which may help minimize the risks to bridging veins and sulcal vessels </plain></SENT>
