<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm (SITA) is a new testing strategy for the Humphrey perimeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The standard SITA algorithm shortens test time in adults without increasing variability, but its usefulness for detecting field defects in children has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 92 standard SITA 24-2 visual fields of children, most of whom had various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathies</z:hpo> (pediatric idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, homonymous defects, bitemporal defects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> from <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>), and compared them with 49 full threshold 24-2 fields obtained in similar patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated outcome measures of foveal threshold, mean defect, pattern standard deviation, false-negative and false-positive rates, and test time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five children (9 eyes) had both SITA and full threshold testing (FTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SITA decreased test time by over 50% compared with FTT (12.6 +/- 3.0 minutes vs 6.6 +/- 1.6 minutes [P &lt;.00001]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When patients with field defects were eliminated, the pattern standard deviation was lower with SITA than FTT (P &lt;.002), indicating lower intratest variability of SITA in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No detectable difference was observed in the other outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjective analysis of gray-scale fields in patients who underwent testing with the use of both strategies showed marked similarities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SITA shortens test time significantly compared with FTT and does so without jeopardizing interpretability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SITA has less intratest variability than FTT and therefore should be better for detecting and following defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Caution is advised when following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo> unless the same strategy is used for each evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Switching strategies in the absence of a stable field defect is not recommended </plain></SENT>
