<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014008" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Empty sella syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e>) is a radiographic finding that can be associated with elevated CSF pressures and may represent a radiographic indicator of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our experience with CSF leaks of various causes, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e> in the spontaneous and nonspontaneous categories, and the potential pathophysiology and unique management issues of the spontaneous CSF leak group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of medical records, imaging studies, and surgical treatment of CSF leaks in patients treated by the senior author </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients with spontaneous CSF leaks and 12 patients with nonspontaneous CSF leaks were surgically treated from 1996 through 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the spontaneous group, 15 patients had complete imaging of the sella turcica </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten had completely empty sellae and 5 had partially empty sellae, for a total of 100% (15 of 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the nonspontaneous group, 9 patients had complete imaging of the sella </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 11% (1 of 9) had a partially empty sella and that was a congenital leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison of proportions between these 2 groups was significant (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous group consisted primarily of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, middle-aged females (13 of 16 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Empty sella probably represents a sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> that leads to idiopathic, spontaneous CSF leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous CSF leaks are strongly associated with the radiographic finding of an empty sella and are more common in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> females, similar to benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This unique population may require more aggressive surgical and medical treatment to prevent recurrent or multiple leaks </plain></SENT>
