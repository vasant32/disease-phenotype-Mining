<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary RDD of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system is most uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on a 35-year-old man with isolated RDD of the meninges overlying the left cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presenting signs and symptoms included severe progressive ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> of 4 months duration, as well as laboratory evidence of mild non-specific systemic inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On magnetic resonance imaging, the lesion was seen as a contrast-enhancing, plaque-like thickening of the dura mater over the left convexity,without impinging on adjacent bone or cerebral parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meningeal biopsy revealed a mixed mononuclear infiltrate dominated by CD68(+), S100(+), CD1a(-) non-Langerhans type histiocytes on a background of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bacteria, in particular mycobacteria, and fungi were excluded with special stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extensive clinical workup, encompassing computed tomography of thoracal and abdominal organs, bone marrow biopsy, and bronchoalveolar lavage failed to reveal any extracranial involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, including C- and P-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear antibody, and serum rheumatoid factor, were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">Methylprednisolone</z:chebi> therapy induced complete remission of symptoms, with the neuroradiologic status remaining unchanged on follow-up after 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We discuss the complex clinicopathologic differential diagnosis and therapeutic issues of this rare condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While the correct diagnosis of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system RDD is unlikely to be established without invasive procedures (biopsy), a conservative therapeutic approach may be considered a legitimate option </plain></SENT>
