<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A mathematical model of intracranial pressure (ICP) dynamics has been extended to accommodate venous sinus compression through the introduction of a Starling-like resistor between the sagittal and transverse sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the absence of this type of resistor, the sinuses are rigid, and the model has only a unique, stable steady state with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With resistance a function of the external pressure on the sinus, a second stable steady state may exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This state is characterized by elevated ICP concurrent with a compressed transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simulations predict that a temporary perturbation that causes a transient elevation of ICP can induce a permanent transition from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to the higher steady state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparisons to clinical data from IIH patients provide supporting evidence for the validity of the model's predictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simulations suggest a possible clinical diagnostic technique to determine if an individual has a compressible transverse sinus and is at risk for developing IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results of the model experiments suggest that the primary cause of IIH may be a compressible, as opposed to rigid, transverse sinus, and that the observed stenosis is a necessary characteristic of the elevated pressure state </plain></SENT>
