<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other recent work has shown that the difference in intraocular pressure (IOP) and cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFp) may be very important in the pathogenesis of diseases of the optic nerve, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> (Berdahl and Allingham, 2009; Berdahl, Allingham, et al., 2008; Berdahl et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2011) [2-6] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference in IOP and CSFp across the lamina cribrosa is known as the translaminar pressure difference (TLPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that in zero gravity, CSF no longer pools in the caudal spinal column as it does in the upright position on earth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instead, CSF diffuses throughout the subarachnoid space resulting in a moderate but persistently elevated cranial CSF pressure, including the region just posterior to the lamina cribrosa known as the optic nerve subarachnoid space (ONSAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This small but chronically elevated CSFp could lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> when CSFp is greater than the IOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If the TLPD is the cause of optic nerve head <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in astronauts subjected to prolonged zero gravity, raising IOP and/or orbital pressure may treat this condition and protect astronauts in future space travels from the effect of zero gravity on the optic nerve head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the same TLPD concept may offer a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment options of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and other diseases of the optic nerve head </plain></SENT>
