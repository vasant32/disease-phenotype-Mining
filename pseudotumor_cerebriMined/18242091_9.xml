<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study defines the interaction between arterial inflow and venous outflow in patients with outflow stenoses and IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty patients with clinical IIH underwent standard MRI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> flow quantification studies of the cerebral arteries and veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 21/40 patients with venous stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The arterial inflow was 21% higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (p=0.01); however, the superior sagittal sinus outflow was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, giving a reduced percentage of venous outflow compared to inflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were followed up after remission of their symptoms and the arterial inflows and percentage outflow returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is a spectrum of findings in IIH; patients with stenoses have lower inflows than those with patent sinuses but still have evidence of collateral flow </plain></SENT>
