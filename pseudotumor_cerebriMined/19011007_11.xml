<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement of peripapillary <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> associated with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> underwent a complete ophthalmic examination, including peripapillary RNFL analysis with OCT (Fast RNFL thickness 3.46; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA) at diagnosis and 3, 6, and 12 months after presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-matched control subjects underwent a similar evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in RNFL overall thickness and by quadrant and interocular differences were evaluated and studied regarding changes in visual field global indices (mean deviation [MD] and pattern SD [PSD]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both eyes of 22 patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and 22 control subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, the RNFL thickness was 183.3 +/- 74.7 microm and 74.9% (78.5 microm) greater than in control eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean RNFL thicknesses in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> quadrants were significantly greater in eyes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean average RNFL was significantly correlated with the MD (sigma = -0.451, P = 0.002) and PSD (sigma = 0.370, P = 0.013) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RNFL thickness decreased significantly (P = 0.000), whereas the mean MD and the mean PSD improved (P = 0.000 and P = 0.005, respectively) at each follow-up visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis showed that for every 10 microm of mean RNFL thickness increase at baseline, there was a 0.6-dB decrease in MD at the last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Peripapillary RNFL thickness abnormalities assessed by OCT in patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> were quantitatively correlated with visual field sensitivity losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data support the possible use of OCT as a noninvasive quantitative method of monitoring the amount and evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
