<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most previously described devices for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> monitoring of ICP are of limited value because of uncertain drift from zero-point readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Hittman-Meyer ICP sensor approaches the ideal for a long term monitoring device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is fully implantable and is accurate over a wide range of pressures and for extended periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is designed so that in vivo calibration may be performed in a noninvasive fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report the use of this device in eight patients with pseudomotor cerebri </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It has functioned accurately for periods ranging up to 14 months after implantation and has proven to be a valuable aid in the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
