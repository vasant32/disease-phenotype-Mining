<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was thought at that time that there were inadequate data to support bariatric surgery in severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An estimated 25% of children in the United States are <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, a number that has doubled over a 30-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Very little information has been published on the subject of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> surgery in adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore we reviewed our 20-year database on bariatric surgery in adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adolescents, ranging from 12 to less than 18 years of age, were considered eligible for bariatric surgery according to the National Institutes of Health adult criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gastroplasty was the procedure of choice in the initial 3 years of the study followed by gastric bypass, which was found to be significantly more effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distal gastric bypass (D-GBP) was used in extremely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (BMI &gt; or =60 kg/m(2)) before 1992 and long-limb gastric bypass (LL-GBP) was used for superobese patients (BMI &gt; or =50 kg/m(2)) after 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic gastric bypass was used after 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three adolescents (27 white, 6 black; 19 females, 14 males) underwent the following bariatric operations between 1981 and June 2001: horizontal gastroplasty in one, vertical banded gastroplasty in two, standard gastric bypass in 17 (2 laparoscopic), LL-GBP in 10, and D-GBP in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean BMI was 52 +/- 11 kg/m(2) (range 38 to 91 kg/m(2)), and mean age was 16 +/- 1 years (range 12.4 to 17.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preoperative comorbid conditions included the following: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005978'>type II diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in two patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 11, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> in three, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in five, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> in six, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> in two, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000147'>polycystic ovary</z:hpo> syndrome in one, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> in one, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001379'>degenerative joint disease</z:hpo> in 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or anastomotic leaks </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Late complications included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235329" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">small bowel obstruction</z:e> in one and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernias</z:hpo> in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were two late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> (2 years and 6 years postoperatively), but these were unlikely to have been caused by the bariatric surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Revision procedures included one D-GBP to gastric bypass for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> and one gastric bypass to LL-GBP for inadequate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Regain of most or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the lost weight was seen in five patients at 5 to 10 years after surgery; however, significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was maintained in the remaining patients for up to 14 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Comorbid conditions resolved at 1 year with the exception of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in two patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in two, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001379'>degenerative joint disease</z:hpo> in seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Self-image was greatly enhanced; eight patients have married and have children, five patients have completed college, and one patient is currently in college </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is increasing rapidly in adolescents and is associated with significant comorbidity and social stigmatization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Bariatric surgery in adolescents is safe and is associated with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> comorbidity, and improved self-image and socialization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These data strongly support <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> surgery for those unfortunate individuals who may have difficulty obtaining insurance coverage based on the 1991 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference statement </plain></SENT>
