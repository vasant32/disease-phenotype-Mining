<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To characterize the pathogenesis and clinical features of optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome (SAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 4 patients with SAS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (PE) underwent complete neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation and lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, continuous 24-hour intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 patients had bilateral PE that was asymmetric in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had optic nerve dysfunction, asymmetric in 1, unilateral in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Daytime cerebrospinal fluid pressure measurements were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nocturnal monitoring performed in one patient, however, demonstrated repeated episodes of marked ICP elevation associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and arterial oxygen desaturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We propose that PE in SAS is due to episodic nocturnal hypoxemia and hypercarbia resulting in increased ICP secondary to cerebral vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these individuals, intermittent ICP elevation is sufficient to cause persistent disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients may be at increased risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> secondary to PE compared with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> because of associated hypoxemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of SAS PE may not be appreciated because daytime cerebrospinal fluid pressure measurements are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and because patients tend to present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> rather than with symptoms of increased ICP </plain></SENT>
