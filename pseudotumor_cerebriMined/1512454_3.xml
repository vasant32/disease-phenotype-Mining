<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This assay was compared with the standard technique of indirect haemagglutination test (IHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of the two techniques were matched with retrospective analysis of proven diagnosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ELISA and IHA was found to be positive respectively in 88 and 84 percent of CSF and 92 and 87.2 percent of serum samples from proven NC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IHA technique was found to be absolutely specific for the detection of antibodies in CSF samples while cross reactions were observed with ELISA technique in CSF from 5 patients, one each suffering from disappearing CT scan lesion, tubercular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (culture negative), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and non compressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338437" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurocysticercosis</z:e> cannot be absolutely ruled out in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the techniques were found to be highly non specific for the detection of antibodies in serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that either of the two techniques may be used for the detection of antibodies in CSF samples from clinically suspected NC patients with high degree of sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
