<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates their radiologic and histological features to elucidate diagnostic clues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six cases were included in the study, one man and five women, ranging in age from 44 to 87 years (mean age, 61 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologically, three cases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo>, and one case each had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were evaluated radiologically on MRI, most of them by thallim-201 single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography ((201)Tl-SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases were examined using H&amp;E, special stains, and immunohistochemical studies with a variety of antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI demonstrated perifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and ring-like or solid enhancement, mimicking the <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted MRI showed a hypo-iso-intensity with a hyperintensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A (201)Tl-SPECT study revealed no uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although there were various kinds of pathology, inflammatory cells were observed, associated with vascular proliferation and reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, some cases showed demyelinating or destructive changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that intra-axial pseudotumors in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system contain various kinds of pathology, and detailed clinicopathological analysis is important from the point of view of differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
