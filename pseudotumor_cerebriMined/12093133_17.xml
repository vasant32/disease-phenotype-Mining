<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study reports a retrospective analysis of the evidence of cranial venous outflow pathology in 188 patients with pseudotumour syndrome (PTS) investigated over the period 1968-1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Standard methods of investigation appropriate to the period were used, i.e. cerebral angiography, CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, some patients had specific venous studies including intraluminal cranial venous sinus pressure measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A sub-group (25 patients) was investigated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological abnormalities</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of cranial venous outflow abnormality was 19.7% (37 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In decades, related to the predominant investigative method, the figures were: to 1979, 4.2% (2 cases); to 1989, 15.0% (8 cases); to 1999, 31.0% (27 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002624'>venous abnormality</z:hpo> was identified in 20 cases, most commonly haematological and iatrogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> females) no cause was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 25 patients (60%) tested specifically were found to have a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological abnormality</z:e>, although no correlation was shown between this and a demonstrable venous outflow abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The conclusion was drawn that there is a high incidence (close to one-third) of venous outflow abnormalities in PTS with detailed investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Issues of mechanism and therapy are discussed </plain></SENT>
