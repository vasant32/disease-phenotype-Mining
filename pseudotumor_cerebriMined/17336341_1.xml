<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Optic nerve sheath fenestration or ventricular shunting are classically proposed after failure of medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is caused by venous sinus obstruction in an unknown percentage of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, endoluminal venous sinus stenting was proposed as an alternative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between September 2003 and December 2004, eight consecutive patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> underwent MRI venography and direct retrograde cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were five females and three males aged 22 to 55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cerebrospinal fluid pressure ranged from 27 to 45 mmHg with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented at least one sinus stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endovascular stenting of the stenotic venous sinus was performed under intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-platelet therapy was administered for 3 months post treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intra-sinus pressures were invariably reduced by stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients improved clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cerebrospinal fluid pressure had normalized at 3-month follow-up in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, multidetector row CT-angiography or MRI venography was performed at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up and demonstrated the patency of the stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The importance of venous sinus disease as a cause of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is probably underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> should be evaluated with direct retrograde cerebral venography and manometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In patients with venous sinus lesions, treatment by an endoluminal venous sinus stent is a safe and effective alternative for amenable lesions </plain></SENT>
