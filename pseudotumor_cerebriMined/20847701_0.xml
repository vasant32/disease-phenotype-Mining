<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated a new minimally invasive surgical technique for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in a cadaveric model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique aims at establishing a communication between the intraorbital and intracranial compartments by creating a bone, dural, and periorbital window in the anterior cranial fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This procedure is predicated on intraorbital absorptive capability that has been demonstrated in animals and discussed in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three fresh cadaver heads were fixed in a head holder so as to mimic the hyperextended supine position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure was conducted bilaterally in each specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our technique is as follows: 1) An incision is made in the eyebrow medial to the supraorbital notch; 2) using an endoscope and a periosteal elevator, the intraorbital surface of the orbital roof is separated from the periorbita in an anteroposterior direction for a length of 1.5-2.5 cm; 3) a 1 cm of the exposed orbital roof is removed, and the dura and arachnoid are opened; and 4) slits are made in the exposed periorbita </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We were able to create a communication between the intracranial and the intraorbital compartments in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our technique is new and does not require any foreign body implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its applicability in humans needs to be evaluated in a clinical context </plain></SENT>
