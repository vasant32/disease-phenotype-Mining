<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine changes in color Doppler imaging parameters before and after optic nerve sheath decompression (ONSD) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Color Doppler imaging was performed within 48 hours before surgery and within 48 hours after the procedure using a color Doppler unit with a 7.5-MHz phased linear transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulsed Doppler spectrum analyses were recorded digitally on videotape from the ophthalmic, central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi>, and short posterior ciliary arteries, using a 0.4 x 0.6-mm sample volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood flow velocities in the ophthalmic, short posterior ciliary, and central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteries of 24 eyes were significantly decreased compared with a healthy age-matched group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eyes with visual acuities worse than 20/30 before surgery had significantly decreased velocities in the ophthalmic, short posterior ciliary, and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteries, whereas in eyes with visual acuities better than 20/30, only the short posterior ciliary and central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteries demonstrated decreased velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, Gosling's pulsatility index was increased for the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery but not the ophthalmic or short posterior ciliary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen eyes improving in visual acuity and field after ONSD demonstrated significant improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> color Doppler imaging parameters for the short posterior ciliary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ophthalmic artery diastolic velocity also increased significantly but the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery parameters did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The eyes that remained stable or worsened did not demonstrate significant postoperative changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that some of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> may be due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and worsening visual acuity correlates with greater impairment of the retrobulbar circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of the mechanisms by which ONSD improves visual function may be reversal of this ischemic process </plain></SENT>
