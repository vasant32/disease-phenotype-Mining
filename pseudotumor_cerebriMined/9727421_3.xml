<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of adapting confocal scanning laser (CSL) tomography of the optic disc for quantitative evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Confocal scanning laser tomography of the optic disc was performed in 11 patients with diagnosed PTC and 12 visually <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects of similar age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In five patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, CSL tomography was performed serially over several months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To quantify optic disc characteristics, surface topography was measured in 0.1-mm steps along the horizontal and vertical meridians and four oblique meridians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Best fit polynomial functions, describing surface topography along each meridian, were derived using linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Third-order polynomials provided excellent fits (significantly better than the second-order functions) to the surface topography for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> meridians in the control subjects and patients with PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In control subjects and PTC patients an asymmetry in the slope of the optic disc contours was evident along the horizontal but not the vertical meridian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> a significant elevation of the center of the disc was accompanied by a change in overall surface topography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each of the PTC patients followed up serially had a pronounced posterior deformation of the disc (i.e., a reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>) that was initially apparent in the temporal meridian and did not proceed uniformly across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> meridians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Confocal scanning laser tomography can quantify the magnitude and monitor the resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Studies of optic nerve head topography may provide further insight into optic nerve compliance with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
