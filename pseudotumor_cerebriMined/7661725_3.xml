<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations of impaired cranial venous outflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective study of 20 patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> as the result of impaired cerebral drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Three neuro-ophthalmologic referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Ten patients had noncompressive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of sagittal or lateral sinuses (noncompressive group), four had compression of the sagittal sinus or jugular veins (compressive group), and six had transient sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> following surgical procedures (iatrogenic group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Medical and/or surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> and of underlying conditions predisposing to venous obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014877" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esodeviation</z:e>) and signs (visual acuity, visual fields, and optic disc appearance) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was more severe, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014877" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esodeviation</z:e> was more prevalent, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was more abrupt in the noncompressive group than in the compressive and iatrogenic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 10 patients with noncompressive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, factors predisposing to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were present in seven patients but sometimes overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following treatment, visual outcome was generally favorable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had 20/30 or better visual acuity in at least <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp>, and substantial visual field loss was present in both eyes of only two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestation of impaired cerebral venous outflow vary depending on the underlying mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although most patients maintain good vision, more aggressive treatment is sometimes indicated in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and marked severity of symptoms in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> should help to differentiate these patients from those with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
