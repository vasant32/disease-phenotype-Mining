<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous venous pulsations were present in 87.6% of 146 unselected subjects 20 to 90 years of age and absent in 100% of 33 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lumbar puncture in nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> established the upper level at which spontaneous pulsations disappear as 190 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>, and no pressure above 180 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> was found in 29 patients with venous pulsations present prior to lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the presence or absence of venous pulsations and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects with absent pulsations showed definite pulsations on subsequent examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm that the presence of spontaneous venous pulsations is a reliable indicator of an intracranial pressure below 180 to 190 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>, while the absence of pulsations may be found with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial pressure and is therefore not a reliable guide to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
