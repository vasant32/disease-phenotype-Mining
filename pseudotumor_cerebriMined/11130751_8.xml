<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We postulated that an alteration in endogenous vitamin A (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi>) metabolism plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> was determined by a fluorometric method from 40 control subjects and 58 patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">Retinol</z:chebi> binding protein (RBP) was also assayed by quantitative radial immunodiffusion in 17 control subjects and 30 patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> values were higher in the IIH group compared with the control group, but did not reach a significant level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, seven of 30 patients with IIH had high RBP levels, but none of the control subjects did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This data suggests that IIH is associated with an abnormality in vitamin A metabolism that is linked to its transport system </plain></SENT>
