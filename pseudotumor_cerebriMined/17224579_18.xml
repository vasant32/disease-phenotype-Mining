<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with IIH seen at two institutions. "Fulminant IIH" was defined as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and signs of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (less than 4 weeks between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of initial symptoms and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>), rapid worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> over a few days, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography (or CT venogram) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen cases with "fulminant IIH" were included (16 women, mean age 23.8 years [range 14 to 39 years]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo>, four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo>, and none had known <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first lumbar puncture performed for the diagnosis showed a mean CSF opening pressure of 54.1 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> (range 29 to 60 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to the initial lumbar puncture, medical treatment included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (1 to 2 g/day) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and IV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeat lumbar punctures were performed in 11 of the 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration in five cases, lumboperitoneal CSF shunting procedure in nine cases, and ventriculoperitoneal shunting procedure in two cases) was performed because of ongoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median delay between evaluation in neuro-ophthalmology and surgery was 3 days (range a few hours to 37 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients reported dramatic improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Visual function improved in 14 cases, although 8 patients (50%) remained legally blind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Visual fields remained severely altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Severe and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> suggests "fulminant idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>" and should prompt aggressive management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Urgent surgery may be required in these patients, and temporizing measures such as repeat lumbar punctures, lumbar drainage, and IV steroids considered </plain></SENT>
