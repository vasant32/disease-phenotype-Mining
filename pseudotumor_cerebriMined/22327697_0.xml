<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These conditions are frequently present in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) and may be associated with abnormalities of the hypocretin system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine HC-1 concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a series of patients with IIH and to compare these concentrations with those in a control group with no neurological alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study included a cohort of 26 consecutive patients with IIH who were mostly women (25 vs. 1) with a mean age of 42.5 ± 13.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF samples were obtained from a lumbar puncture performed between 08:00 and 10:00 a.m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HC-1 was determined by a competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) using I(125) as the isotope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF were obtained during spinal anesthesia for urological, general or vascular surgery from 40 patients (10 women and 30 men with a mean age of 63.7 ± 14.8) with no previous neurological or psychiatric history, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurological examination, and MMSE scores of ≥ 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between HC-1 levels in the CSF of patients with IIH (119.61 ± 21.63 pg/mL) and those of the control group (119.07 ± 20.30 pg/mL; p = 0.918) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HC-1 is not associated with the clinical symptoms present in patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
