<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review at a tertiary academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presenting with spontaneous CSF otorrhea or rhinorrhea over a consecutive 8-year period were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinic charts and operative reports were reviewed to obtain the clinical presentation, examination findings, diagnostic test results, intraoperative findings, operative technique, and postoperative follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical approach and materials used for repair were determined by the location of the defect(s) and surgeon preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients underwent 19 operations for repair of spontaneous CSF otorrhea or rhinorrhea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 61 years and the male to female ratio was 5:12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> female patients had a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common presenting symptom was otorrhea after a myringotomy or placement of a tympanostomy tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A middle fossa craniotomy was used in 17 approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common defect sites were located over the tegmen mastoideum and tegmen tympani </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple materials were used in most repairs including allogenic bone cement and autologous materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient had persistent otorrhea after a transmastoid approach and required a middle fossa craniotomy to repair a tegmen mastoideum defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous CSF otorrhea is uncommon and often not diagnosed until a myringotomy or tympanostomy tube is placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The middle fossa craniotomy provides the best exposure for defects involving the middle fossa floor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Both alloplastic and autologous materials are highly successful in repairing the defect(s) responsible for CSF otorrhea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> of the alloplastic bone cement occurred in our series </plain></SENT>
