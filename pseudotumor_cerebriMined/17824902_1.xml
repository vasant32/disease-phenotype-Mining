<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the contribution of TCD to their evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with suspected IIH underwent TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean blood flow (BFV), peak systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic (EDV) velocities, and pulsatility (PI) and resistance (RI) indexes were obtained in the middle cerebral (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and vertebral (VA) arteries and compared (Student's t-test) between patients with confirmed IIH and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IIH patients and controls were comparable in terms of age, gender and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean +/- SD BFV(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), PSV(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), EDV(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and PI(VA) in the 13 IIH patients were higher than in the ten controls (59 +/- 6.8, 94 +/- 28.5, 43 +/- 12.4, 0.86 +/- 0.16 and 50 +/- 8.6, 72 +/- 25.8, 32 +/- 11.5, 0.58 +/- 0.45 respectively, P &lt; 0.05) but still within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- SD PI(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), RI(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and RI(VA) values in the IIH patients and controls were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCD parameters had no useful unique features for monitoring IIH patients </plain></SENT>
