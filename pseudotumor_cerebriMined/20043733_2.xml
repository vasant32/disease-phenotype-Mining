<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: In the majority of adults with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), there is an elevation in venous pressure associated with a venous outflow stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In about 15% of IIH patients the elevated venous pressure is associated with an elevation in blood flow but little or no evidence of a stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Venostenotic IIH and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in children with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood inflow have been shown to be equivalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test whether children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and an elevated arterial inflow have a vascular pathophysiology that is analogous to the hyperemic form of IIH in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine children with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging with flow quantification and were found to have arterial inflows 2 SDs above the mean for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the head circumference, ventricular enlargement, total blood inflow, superior sagittal sinus (SSS)/straight sinus (SS) outflow, and the degree of collateral venous flow were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with findings in 14 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In hyperemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> the cerebral blood inflow was elevated but the SSS and SS outflows were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sinus outflow as a percentage of the inflow was reduced by 8 percentage points in the SSS territory and 5 percentage points in the SS territory compared with findings in the controls (p = 0.04, p = 0.003, respectively), suggesting blood was returning via collateral channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Similar to patients with hyperemic IIH, children with hyperemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> show a significant elevation in collateral venous flow, indicating that the same venous pathophysiology may be operating in both conditions </plain></SENT>
