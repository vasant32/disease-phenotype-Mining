<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Case reports of familial idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) have appeared sporadically and infrequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with IIH seen at our institution to identify the number of familial cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of a cohort of 237 patients with IIH, we identified 27 members (25 women and 2 men) from 11 families, with IIH usually self-reported or reported by the index case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 7 of the 11 families, the relationship was parent to child; in 4, it was sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was present in 85% of the family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Familial IIH appears to be more common than reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A systematic evaluation of first-degree relatives may help to identify more cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A study of the patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and associated co-morbidities may result in better understanding of the genetic issues with this disorder </plain></SENT>
