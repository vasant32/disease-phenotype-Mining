<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Transverse sinus tapered narrowings are frequently identified in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH); however, it remains unclear whether they are primary stenoses or whether they occur secondary to raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic venography demonstrates both the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the venous system and the adjacent bony grooves so it may provide an insight into the aetiology of these transverse sinus stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tapered transverse sinus narrowings (&gt;50%) were studied in 19 patients without IIH and 14 patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography vascular studies were reviewed and the dimensions of the venous sinuses and bony grooves at the sites of maximum and minimum transverse sinus area dimensions were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was demonstrated to be a strong correlation of bony groove height with venous sinus height at the largest portions of the transverse sinus in both IIH patients and non-IIH subjects as well as at the transverse sinus narrowing in non-IIH subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a discordant relationship between bony groove height and venous sinus height at the site of transverse sinus stenoses in IIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 5/23 IIH transverse sinus stenoses, the bony groove height was proportionate to that seen in non-IIH subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were a further 8/23 cases where the small or absent sinus was associated with an absent bony groove </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transverse sinus tapered narrowings in subjects without IIH and in the majority of patients with IIH were associated with proportionately small or absent grooves, and these are postulated to be primary or fixed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some patients with IIH demonstrate tapered transverse sinus stenoses with disproportionately large bony grooves, suggesting a secondary or acquired narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This implies a varied aetiology for the transverse sinus stenoses of IIH </plain></SENT>
