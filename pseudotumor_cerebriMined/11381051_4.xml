<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with variable degrees of recently diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> associated with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) were evaluated with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) and automated perimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up with serial measurements over a period of 5 to 30 months (mean +/- SD, 17.1 +/- 9), while under medical treatment (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tomographic parameters, volume above reference (VAR), volume above surface (VAS), effective mean height (<z:mp ids='MP_0000240'>EMH</z:mp>), and maximum height in contour (MxHC), were obtained by tomography, either globally or from predefined disc sectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The perimetric indices, mean deviation (MD) and pattern SD (PSD), were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results from patients' right eyes and the individual intereye differences in both tomographic and perimetric parameters, were statistically evaluated by nonparametric correlational (Spearman) and repeated measures (Wilcoxon) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tomographic parameters were negatively correlated with MD in global (r = -0.8) and sectorial (r = -0.6) evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interocular differences in overall tomographic parameters were correlated with corresponding differences in perimetric MD (r = -0.8) and PSD (r = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, volumetric disc parameters decreased (P &lt; 0.02), whereas perimetric MD increased (P = 0.02) at comparable times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recently diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, optic nerve head tomographic abnormalities are quantitatively correlated with visual field sensitivity losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic improvement of volumetric parameters may be paralleled by recovery in perimetric sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data support the possible use of both techniques in combination to monitor the amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and the effectiveness of treatments designed to reduce intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
