<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We carried out a retrospective study of 5 patients admitted at King Khalid National Guard Hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with IIH during the period from January 2001 to December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were females with their age ranges from 24 to 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentations, and the laboratory and imaging studies were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The opening pressures of the lumbar puncture tests were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One had typical pain of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo>, and one with neck pain and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">radiculopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001349'>Facial diplegia</z:hpo> was present in one patient, and 2 patients had bilateral 6th <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Imaging study was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and they had a very high opening pressure during lumbar puncture, except in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved full recovery with medical therapy in 6 to 12 weeks with no relapse during the mean follow up of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Atypical findings in IIH are rare and require a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
