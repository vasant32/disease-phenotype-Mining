<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the correlation between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and TCD parameters under conditions of boundary intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> that can cause brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intracranial pressure was raised by inflation of a supratentorial epidural balloon in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery was measured transorbitally with microvascular Doppler sonography, and intracranial pressure and CBF were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this study, four characteristic flow patterns were observed, appearing in the following order with progressive increases in intracranial pressure: sharp wave, systolic flow, systolic spike, and no flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These flow patterns showed a significant correlation with flow velocity, CBF, the pulsatility index, and cerebral perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The systolic-spike and no-flow patterns and pulsatility index over 4.0 indicated decreased CBF, under 10% of control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The critical level of brain circulation can be detected by Doppler sonography, indicating that TCD is available as a tool for the assessment of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> in brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
