<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite aggressive therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> often is caused by refractory intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An understanding of the contributions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and vascular factors to IH after BI is essential for management of intracranial pressure (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marmarou et al. showed that CSF accounted for only one third of the ICP rise after BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a vascular mechanism is predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral cortical reflectance photoplethysmography (IP) and radioactively labeled red blood cells were employed to study cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes associated with increased ICP after BI in miniature swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediate posttraumatic IH could be attributed almost entirely to increased CBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An early elevation in ICP immediately after BI (t = 0) was accompanied by a large increase in CBV compared with pre-BI levels (19.2 +/- 4.9 vs. 8.9 +/- 2.7 mL/100 g tissue, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreased CBV corresponded to lower ICP within 1 hour, followed by a slow rise that paralleled the increase in ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CBV (16.1 +/- 3.3 vs. 8.9 +/- 2.7, p &lt; 0.05) and ICP (23 +/- 2.2 vs. 9 +/- 0.6, p &lt; 0.05) were higher at 6 hours than at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on compartmental analysis, the data indicate that ICP changes immediately after BI and within 6 hours are predominantly caused by increased CBV </plain></SENT>
