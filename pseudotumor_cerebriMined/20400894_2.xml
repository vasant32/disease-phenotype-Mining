<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examine thrombophilic factors in a group of patients with IIH in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we reviewed the relevant literature and performed a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> work-up was performed on 51 patients with IIH at least 1 month following their first episode </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 51 patients 40 were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased concentrations of fibrinogen, D-Dimer, factor VIII, factor IX and factor XI were found in 15, 7, 7, 6 and 2 patients, respectively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the meta-analysis <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were significantly associated with IIH [odds ratio (OR) of 4.25 (1.68-12.60)], similar to the association with high factor VIII [OR = 16.17 (2.87-91.01)], higher plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels [OR = 6.91 (2.28-20.91)], and high <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) [LP(a)] [OR = 3.54 (1.54-8.70)] </plain></SENT>
