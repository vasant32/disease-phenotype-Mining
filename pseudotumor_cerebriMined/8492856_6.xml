<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, it is important to distinguish between active cerebral vasodilation, indicating functional autoregulation, and a passive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular dilation</z:e> as the cause for raised ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An experimental study was performed in feline models of diffusely raised ICP (n = 6), of active arterial vasodilation caused by arterial hypercarbia (n = 6), and of passive arterial dilation caused by pharmacologically induced arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n = 6) to determine if wave form analysis of ICP can distinguish active from passive arteriolar vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulsatile pressure transmission from the blood pressure pulse to the ICP pulse (cerebrovascular pressure transmission [CVPT]), cerebrovascular resistance, and craniospinal compliance were measured simultaneously at each level of raised ICP, arterial hypercarbia, and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial hypercarbia, caused by both 5 and 10% inspired <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> increased low-frequency CVPT, which was followed by an increasingly negative phase shift between the blood pressure and ICP wave form (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusely raised ICP caused by intraventricular infusion of mock cerebrospinal fluid caused increased low-frequency CVPT (P &lt; 0.01) but resulted in no overall change in phase shift, although the sign of the phase shift remained negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, caused by the infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, where there was loss of myogenic tone, an increased low-frequency CVPT was accompanied by a positive phase shift (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate it may be possible to distinguish active arteriolar vasodilation from a passive loss of autoregulatory vascular tone through simultaneous measurement of the low-frequency CVPT and phase shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the ICP wave form provides information relevant to the management of raised ICP </plain></SENT>
