<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper investigates 21 patients (16 infants and 5 children) with Pneumococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, 15 of which presented with a severe form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure (IP) monitoring was performed in 7 patients who <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had severe (4) or mild (3) intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve children had a favourable outcome, 7 had sequelae (3 severe) and 2 died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coning</z:e>, one before monitoring, the second after exhibiting the highest IP and the lowest cerebral perfusion pressure of the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 3 children with severe sequelae had a severe form (2) or a mild but prolonged form (1) of IH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 4 patients who recovered with moderate sequelae presented severe (1), mild IH (1) or were not monitored (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 14 cases with neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients, this seemed to be related to cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and IH; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coning</z:e> caused the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 2 of them; the 6 others exhibited lesions of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> on CT-scan, isolated or associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> or subdural effusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 6 others patients, IP monitoring was not performed; there was no evidence of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> on CT-scan; 2 exhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and 3 a moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo>; 2 had hemodynamic problems from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pneumococcemia in one case and neurovegetative disturbances associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pneumococcus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> remains a severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of severe forms can be improved by IP monitoring since IH seems to be the most frequent mechanism of complication </plain></SENT>
