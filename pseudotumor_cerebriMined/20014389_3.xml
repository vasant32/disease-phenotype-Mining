<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is not only the result of poor cerebral venous drainage but also life threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify the structures, which may show signs of potential venographic filling defect qualities, including trabeculae/septa (also described as "fibrous bands") and arachnoid granulations, which ultimately can lead to increased intracranial dural sinus venous pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 102 cadavers and living patients were used for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three percent of the subjects presented with structures in their transverse sinuses that could be potential venous filling defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent of the subjects presented with arachnoid granulations in the right transverse sinus, which were found to be significantly dominant (Chi-square; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study also revealed the presence of 1 to 5 septa in 29.4% of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The septa were found to be more dominant in the central (30%) and lateral (22%) thirds of the right transverse sinuses, while the central third of the left transverse sinus proved to be the least dominant occurring site (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In general, the right transverse sinus is highly more significantly dominant in septal occurrence (Chi-square; p &lt; 0.01) than the left transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude from the statistical evidence that the right transverse sinus demonstrates significantly more potential venographic filling defects than the left sinus and submit that this information may assist in management options for patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as well as direct future research </plain></SENT>
