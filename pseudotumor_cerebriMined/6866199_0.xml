<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The literatures concerning its clinical features and pathophysiology are reviewed with short summary of our eighteen cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, based on the clinical reports and our experience, seems to be low in Japan, which may be due to difference on races and/or diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The visual acuity impairment is not always "benign" on its course, in contrast to other symptoms related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT scan is most useful for evaluating the ventricular size and abnormal densities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrast enhancement is required for detecting abnormal enhanced lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography may disclose the dural sinus occlusion and/or dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuous measurement of intracranial pressure can show irregular change from high pressure to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with or without episodic elevation in each case and on each day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is reported that there is no rise of intracranial pressure in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are also some reported cases without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Various factors including increased blood volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and impaired absorption of cerebrospinal fluid may play some role on the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanism of small ventricle associated with impaired absorption of cerebrospinal fluid is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further study about absorption and outflow resistance of cerebrospinal fluid, and alteration of blood volume and brain water content may resolve the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
