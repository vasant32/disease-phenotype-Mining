<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To identify intraorbital and intracranial abnormalities in astronauts previously exposed to microgravity by using quantitative and qualitative magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant, retrospective review and waived the requirement for informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven astronauts (mean age ± standard deviation, 48 years ± 4.5) underwent 3-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging with use of thin-section, three-dimensional, axial T2-weighted orbital and conventional brain sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight astronauts underwent repeat imaging after an additional mission in space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and optic nerve diameter (OND) were quantified in the retrolaminar optic nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OND and central optic nerve T2 hyperintensity were quantified at mid orbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Qualitative analysis of the optic nerve sheath, optic disc, posterior globe, and pituitary gland <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was performed and correlated for association with intracranial evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, central <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and/or mass lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses included the paired t test, Mann-Whitney nonparametric test for group comparisons, Cronbach α coefficient for reproducibility, and Pearson correlation coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> astronauts had previous exposure to microgravity and, thus, control data were not available for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ONSD and OND ranged from 4.7 to 10.8 mm (mean, 6.2 mm ± 1.1) and from 2.4 to 4.5 mm (mean, 3.0 mm ± 0.5), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Posterior globe flattening was seen in seven of the 27 astronauts (26%), optic nerve protrusion in four (15%), and moderate concavity of the pituitary dome with posterior stalk deviation in three (11%) without additional intracranial abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Retrolaminar OND increased linearly relative to ONSD (r = 0.797, Pearson correlation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A central area of T2 hyperintensity was identifiable in 26 of the 27 astronauts (96%) and increased in diameter in association with kinking of the optic nerve sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Exposure to microgravity can result in a spectrum of intraorbital and intracranial findings similar to those in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
