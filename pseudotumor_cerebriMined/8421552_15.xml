<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The long-term course of intracranial pressure (ICP) was studied in 53 patients from a group of 90 patients with severe head injury treated over a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 49 of these, ICP was significantly elevated during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximum in ICP was usually observed 24 to 96 hours posttrauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of patients developed a second rise of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such a course was observed in 15 (31%) of the 49 patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these cases, ICP increased initially to 20 to 30 mm Hg but could be controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, ICP was decreased again for at least 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The secondary ICP rise occurred 3 to 10 days after trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In six patients, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> became uncontrollable and eventually caused brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The outcome of patients with a secondary rise of ICP was worse when compared with that of patients without this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A cause of the secondary ICP rise could only be identified in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Delayed traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, traumatic vasospasm, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> were diagnosed in seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In seven other patients, the secondary ICP rise coincided with a pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, which was not associated with apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because the occurrence and degree of a secondary rise of ICP after severe head injury are important factors affecting outcome, monitoring of ICP after severe head injury should be prolonged </plain></SENT>
