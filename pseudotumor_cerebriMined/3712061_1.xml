<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were assigned to two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group I was comprised of 23 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and high ICP resulting from <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group II included 29 patients with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo> or high ICP resulting from rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plateau waves were frequently observed in patients with baseline pressures ranging from 21 to 40 mmHg in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The isotope cisternographic pattern in the Group I patients showed a large accumulation of radioactivity over the cerebral convexities, while that in the Group II patients revealed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> of the subarachnoid space over both cerebral convexities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The isotope clearance from the intracranial CSF showed a marked delay in both groups of patients with one exception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that, in the limited range of increased ICP caused by delayed CSF absorption, plateau waves are most evident regardless of the isotope cisternographic pattern </plain></SENT>
