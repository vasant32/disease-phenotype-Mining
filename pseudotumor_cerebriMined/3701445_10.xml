<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Centrally released arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been implicated in the regulation of intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain water, and is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors have examined the relationship of AVP levels in CSF to ICP and brain water content in three experimental groups of cats with and without cold-induced vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the cats under general anesthesia, a cold lesion was made and cannulas were placed in the cisterna magna, lateral ventricle, and aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent central and systemic measurements were made while the animals were awake and free-roaming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 1, endogenous AVP levels in CSF were measured every 12 hours over a 48-hour period by radioimmunoassay in cats with sham craniotomy, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>; no significant difference was found between groups although a diurnal variation was seen (range 2 to 18 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 2, either carrier solution or AVP, in doses of 1.5 or 30 ng, was administered via a lateral ventricle every 2 hours over 24 hours in unlesioned cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 3, cats received 2 or 35 ng of carrier solution or AVP in a similar manner, but coupled with a cold lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CSF AVP levels ranged from an average of 100 to 681 pg/ml and 1.4 to 11.9 ng/ml in the two dose groups in both experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither the low nor the high dose had an effect on brain water content in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> white matter (Experiment 2), but both doses increased brain water content in edematous white matter (p less than 0.05 in Experiment 3), as determined by wet and dry weight measurements of standardized pieces of white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ICP was decreased by high-dose AVP in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cats (p less than 0.01 at 24 hours), but in lesioned cats was unchanged by low-dose and increased by high-dose AVP (p less than 0.05 at 18 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that pharmacological doses of central AVP facilitate the production of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
