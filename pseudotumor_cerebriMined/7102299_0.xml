<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increase was accomplished by infusing Ringer solution into the lateral cerebral ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cochlear blood flow was found to autoregulate in response to decreases in perfusion pressures down to 5-6 kPa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This finding is discussed in relation to known effects of intracochlear and intracranial pressure on hearing </plain></SENT>
