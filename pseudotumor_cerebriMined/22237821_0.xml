<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Frisén classification describes stages of optic disc swelling (grades 0-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is the only classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e>, and is used internationally in clinical and research practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite this, there has been very limited evaluation of the scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed the inter-rater reproducibility and ability to discriminate optic disc changes over time using the Frisén classification compared with a system of ranking <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> severity in patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paired disc photographs (before and after treatment) were obtained from 47 patients with IIH (25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six neuro-ophthalmologists blinded to patient identity, clinical information and chronology of the photographs reviewed the discs and allocated a Frisén grade and ranked the paired discs in order of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> severity (disc ranking) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 188 optic disc photographs were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six reviewers agreed in only three comparisons (1.6%) when using the Frisén classification, compared with 42 comparisons (45.2%) when using disc ranking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The probability of agreement between any two reviewers was 36.1% for Frisén grade and 70.0% for disc ranking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disc ranking had significantly greater sensitivity for finding differences in degree of disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, identifying a difference in 75.3% of paired photographs compared to 53.2% detected using the Frisén classification (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated the limited reproducibility and discriminative ability of the Frisén classification in identifying changes in serial optic disc photographs in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Simple optic disc ranking appears to be a more sensitive and reliable tool to monitor changes in optic disc appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The use of disc ranking in clinical practice and research studies is recommended to monitor alterations in optic disc appearance until alternative schemes, specific to IIH, have been developed </plain></SENT>
