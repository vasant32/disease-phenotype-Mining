<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether drawings can aid in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Before taking any history, 226 children who were seen consecutively for the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> were asked to draw a picture to show how their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> felt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pictures were then scored as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> or nonmigraine by pediatric neurologists who were blinded to the clinical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> type was determined independently by another pediatric neurologist using the usual history and examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> type based on the pictures drawn and the clinical findings obtained were then compared to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the drawings for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children produced dramatic and insightful <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> drawings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the clinical diagnosis (gold standard), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> drawings had a sensitivity of 93.1%, a specificity of 82.7%, and a positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of 87.1% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>That is, drawings that contained an artistic feature consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (eg, pounding pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, desire to lie down, periorbital pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000613'>photophobia</z:hpo>, visual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotoma</z:hpo>) predicted the clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> in 87.1% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predictive values were also calculated for specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>-associated features on drawings: artistic depiction of focal neurologic signs, periorbital pain, recumbency, visual symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000613'>photophobia</z:hpo>, scotomata), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> had a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of &gt;90% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>; severe or pounding pain had a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of &gt;80% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Band-like pain was not predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of 11.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Features on drawings such as sadness or crying did not differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> from nonmigraine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Children's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> drawings are a simple, inexpensive aid in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> type, with a very high sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> versus nonmigraine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We encourage the use of drawings in the evaluation of any child with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, as an adjunct to the clinical history and physical examination </plain></SENT>
