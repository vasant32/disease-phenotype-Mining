<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elasticity measurements were made as the patients were studied with a servo-controlled lumbar infusion technique to measure CSF absorptive capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data were evaluated to determine the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and volume, and between ICP variability and the level of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results confirm the exponential nature of the pressure-volume elasticity function in patients who are not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 20 patients were shown to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF absorptive capacities, and there was no difference between their elasticity measurements and those of patients with absorptive defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, ICP variability was shown to be linearly related to the actual level of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The physiological features of the pressure-volume elasticity function are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these considerations, the clinical value and significance of elasticity measurements is questioned </plain></SENT>
