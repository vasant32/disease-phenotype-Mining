<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HISTORY AND SIGNS: A patient presented with recurrent visual disturbances following trabeculectomy in the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraocular pressure in the right and left eye were 11 and 24 mmHg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The optic nerve head was swollen in the right, but not in the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 32 cmH (2)O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging, neurological examination and composition of cerebrospinal fluid were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the modified Dandy criteria, an idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>THERAPY AND OUTCOME: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> led to resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in the right eye within six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The intracranial-intraocular pressure gradient in the right eye was markedly higher as compared to that of the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this pressure gradient induced the collapse of axoplasmatic transport at the lamina cribrosa with subsequent disc swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As no significant pressure gradient was present in the left eye, the optic disc remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on analogous calculations in three additional published cases of unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> we thus suggest that intraocular pressure should be taken into account when evaluating patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
