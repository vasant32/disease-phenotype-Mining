<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe the use of large doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> as a means of treating such swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From a consecutive series of 107 severe head injuries with a Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Score (GCS) of 6 or below, we selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients below 40 years age with a progressive increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) to 40 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first 16 patients (mean age 20 years, mean GCS 4.3) were treated with deep <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (32-35 degrees Celsius) until stable lowering of ICP was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The next 15 patients received conventional intensive care and were in other respects very similar to the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> group (mean age 26, mean GCS 5.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 9-12 months the outcome was classified according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> resulted in 6 good/moderate outcomes, 3 severe and 7 dead/vegetative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional treatment resulted in 2 good/moderate outcomes and 13 dead/vegetative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is a highly significant difference and cannot easily be explained by more severe injuries or complications in the conventional group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Superior control of ICP was achieved by large doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> and the final outcome was better </plain></SENT>
