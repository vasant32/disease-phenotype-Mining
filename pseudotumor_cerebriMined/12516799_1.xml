<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PT) is a disease characterized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> with no apparent etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A majority of cases of PTC occur in adults, with a distinct predilection for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women of childbearing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On rare occasions, PTC will affect children and is associated with different patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A slender 10-year-old boy was brought to clinic with a one-day history of intermittent horizontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> and a two-week history of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> on awakening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity, pupil function, and color vision were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cover test revealed an intermittent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000565'>esotropia</z:hpo> at distance, with full ocular motilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fundus examination revealed swelling of the optic disks OU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further diagnostic testing, treatment, and followup are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> in children is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When present, PTC in children often manifests different characteristics than adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>First, no clear sexual predilection exists for PTC in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Second, the role of associated illnesses and medications is stronger in children than in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Third, the extent of neurologic deficit present in children with PTC is broader than in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children with swollen optic disks warrant a thorough diagnostic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the absence of obvious neuropathology, knowledge of the differences between adult and pediatric PTC can help avoid a diagnostic dilemma </plain></SENT>
