<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that a disadvantage of the internal jugular vein approach to the central circulation may be an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the effect of right internal jugular vein cannulation on intracranial pressure in patients who are at risk of intracerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven adult patients studied in the intensive care unit were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The population included those patients who were admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit requiring intracranial pressure monitoring and central venous access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the intracranial pressure monitor in place, patients were put in supine and 30 degrees head-up positions while intracranial pressure was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Queckenstedt maneuver was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A central venous line was then placed in the right internal jugular vein, and intracranial pressure was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Queckenstedt maneuver was again performed in the study population, and intracranial pressure measurements were recorded for the right, left, and bilateral compression of the internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of the intracranial pressure measurements before and after placement of the central venous line were statistically analyzed using single-factor analysis of variance over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and Apache II scores for the study groups were 8 +/- 4 and 15 +/- 6, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in heart rate; cerebral perfusion pressure; or systolic, mean, or diastolic pressures throughout the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference found between the intracranial pressures at any time point throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no difference was found in percentage change from baseline intracranial pressure data throughout the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that cannulation of the right internal jugular vein is a safe approach to the central circulation in patients at risk of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A description of the possible accommodating mechanisms are outlined </plain></SENT>
