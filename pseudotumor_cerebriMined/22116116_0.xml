<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: IIH is a disorder associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> with no clinical, laboratory, or radiologic evidence of an intracranial space-occupying lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish ONSD standards of healthy pediatric subjects and compare the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> measurements with those of patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred fifteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies of children 4 months to 17 years of age were blinded and reviewed by a pediatric neuroradiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 230 optic nerves were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging examinations were performed in apparently healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This control group included subjects who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging for various reasons, and their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings were interpreted as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging examinations were performed in patients with documented IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ONSD was measured 1 cm anterior to the optic foramina on an axial T2 sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For statistical analysis, both patients and controls were stratified into 4 age groups (I, 0-3 years; II, 3-6 years; III, 6-12 years; IV, 12-18 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean ONSD of the control group in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups (I, 3.1 mm; II, 3.41 mm; III, 3.55 mm; IV, 3.56 mm) was significantly smaller than the mean ONSD of patients (I, 4.35 mm; II, 4.37 mm; III, 4.25 mm; IV, 4.69 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between age and ONSD (r = 0.414, P &lt; .01) was found in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to our study, in pediatric patients with IIH, the ONSD is significantly larger than that in healthy controls regardless of age group and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This measurement might prove to be an auxiliary tool in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
