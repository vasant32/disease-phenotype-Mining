<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Choroidal folds may be caused by several underlying ocular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029182" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">orbital diseases</z:e>; they are classified as idiopathic when no obvious cause is found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether acquired choroidal folds are associated with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this observational case series, three patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fundus examination later developed choroidal folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They underwent complete ocular examination, B-scan ultrasonography, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography, optic coherent tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A neurological consultation, lumbar puncture and measurement of opening pressure of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were also obtained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients with previously <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ocular fundus developed choroidal folds, and optic nerve subarachnoid space enlargement was seen on B-scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiological evaluations identified elevation of intracranial pressure, and biochemical analysis of CSF was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, suggesting a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumour cerebri</z:e>, which was later confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first patient developed choroidal folds in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> first, and 4 years later in the fellow eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second patient presented with bilateral optic disk swelling secondary to intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After treatment, which lowered CSF pressure, bilateral choroidal folds were identified by OCT, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography and ocular fundus photograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The third patient also developed choroidal folds in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp>, but his fellow eye was difficult to evaluate due to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008513" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chorioretinitis</z:e> scar on the macula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OCT identified choroidal folds in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients and in the second patient, it also revealed <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Acquired choroidal folds and optic nerve subarachnoid space enlargement may be signs of idiopathic intracranial pressure elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this diagnosis should be confirmed by lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive imaging studies should be performed to rule out expanding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The lower CSF pressure in our first two patients suggests that choroidal folds or optic disk swelling may depend on the level of intracranial pressure and may be points in a continuum of clinical presentations </plain></SENT>
