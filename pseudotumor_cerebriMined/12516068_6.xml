<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">Amide</z:chebi> II wavelength (6.45 microm) produced by the free electron laser (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FEL</z:e>) can efficiently create an optic nerve sheath fenestration in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wished to determine if it would be equally successful in macaque monkeys and to determine the histopathologic changes between traditional scissors or knife optic nerve sheath fenestration to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FEL</z:e> fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Optic nerve sheath fenestration was performed using either the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FEL</z:e> (6.45 microm, 30 Hz, 2-3 mJ, 325-microm spot size) through a hollow waveguide probe in 12 eyes or with a scissors or a knife in 6 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The monkeys survived 1 month with the fellow optic nerve operated acutely just prior to sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Optic nerves were evaluated histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Less tissue manipulation was required using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FEL</z:e> surgical probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electroretinograms showed minimal or no change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue responses using either method were similar following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> incisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild upregulation of vimentin and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) was seen in astrocytes adjacent to the fenestration, but no change in S100 beta was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FEL</z:e> energy at 6.45 microm delivered through a hollow waveguide appears capable of efficiently and safely producing an optic nerve sheath fenestration in monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This innovative surgical technique should be considered for human use </plain></SENT>
