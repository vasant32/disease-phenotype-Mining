<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These drugs are commonly used in neurosurgical practice for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">Nifedipine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="3647">chlorpromazine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28487">reserpine</z:chebi> reduced the mean ABP, raised the mean ICP and decreased the CPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of these drugs on mean ICP and CPP were more pronounced in patients with severely increased ICP (more than 40 mmHg) than in patients with moderately increased ICP (20-40 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">Thiopental</z:chebi> reduced both mean ABP and ICP, whereas the CPP was unchanged from the preadministration level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> administration, however, respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was observed, and hence, intubation and ventilation were required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that, in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> in patients with increased ICP, <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> are more desirable than agents with calcium channel or alpha-adrenergic blocking actions, despite the problem of respiratory control </plain></SENT>
