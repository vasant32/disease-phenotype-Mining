<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 724 consecutive patients who were referred to St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mary's Medical Center department of radiology for fluoroscopic lumbar puncture from January 2003 through April 2007 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Emergency requests (191) were discarded along with those for patients with clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (21), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (3), and failed attempts (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The collective total was 505 elective lumbar punctures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The blood patch rate for the 22-gauge Whitacre needle was 4.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The result for the 22-gauge Quincke point needle was 15.1% whereas that for the 20-gauge Quincke point needle was 29.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the level of puncture showed a blood patch rate that increased as the level of lumbar puncture lowered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest level of lumbar puncture was L1-L2 with the lowest recorded level being L5-S1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Whitacre needle is associated with a significantly lower incidence of blood patch rate after lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest level of puncture (L1-L2) also provides the lowest level of blood patch rate </plain></SENT>
