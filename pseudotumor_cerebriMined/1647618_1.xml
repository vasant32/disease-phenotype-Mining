<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Use was made of sorption detoxication methods: hemoperfusion (the author's certificate No.1466754) and enterosorption (the priority certificate No.4465054/14 (115542) dated July 22, 1988) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SKH-IK and SKH-2K sorbents were employed as hemoperfusion, using the venovenous scheme of perfusion, the volumetric rate of the blood flow being 100-120 ml/min during 2-3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altogether 2-3 sessions were carried out, with an interval of 5 to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For enterosorption, use was made of a crumbled up filamentous carbonic sorbent in a dose of 50-60 mg per kg bw 3 times a day for 20 days in 2 hourly intervals between food intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regression of the neurological symptoms began 2-3 hours after the first session of hemoperfusion and 5-6 days after the beginning of the intake of the filamentous carbonic sorbent, increasing throughout the whole treatment course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>That coincided with the disappearance of CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and normalization of the immunological spectrum of the blood serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sorption detoxication brought about no complications and is a method of choice in the treatment of CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in patients in the phase of multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> exacerbation </plain></SENT>
