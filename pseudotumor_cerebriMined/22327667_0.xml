<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ICM+ software was introduced into the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Dynamics Laboratory, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, in 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then 1,447 constant rate infusion tests and 123 overnight ICP monitoring sessions (using intraparenchymal bolt) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various configurations were used: ICP only (identification of CSF dynamics model and overnight ICP monitoring with analysis of compensatory reserve and B waves); ICP and arterial pressure (ABP; analysis of the pressure reactivity index); ICP, ABP and transcranial Doppler blood flow velocity (for assessment of cerebral autoregulation); ICP, ABP and near-infrared spectroscopy (for analysis of the fluctuation of cerebral blood volume); ICP, sagittal sinus pressure and jugular vein pressure (in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> to assess the hydrodynamic consequences of cerebral venous sinus stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess vascular factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> a combination of CSF infusion study with PET-CBF studies was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The software contains a database of the shunts tested in the Cambridge Shunt Evaluation Laboratory, aiding shunt assessment in vivo in the case of possible underdrainage or overdrainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The software also enables the digital recording of data, ready for post-hoc manual or batch analysis, the creation of virtual signals (such as critical closing pressure, cerebral compliance etc.) and analysis of their dependency on primary modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A collected database of cases and signals forms a powerful reference tool in the investigation and understanding of the complex pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
