<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine if induction of anaesthesia with etomidate titrated to an early EEG burst suppression pattern would produce minimal changes in cerebral perfusion pressure, and prevent increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) associated with tracheal intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients, 18-71 yr, with intracranial space-occupying lesions, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each patient ICP was monitored via a lateral ventriculostomy catheter placed preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the operating room, an ECG, a radial arterial line, and a two-channel computerized EEG were placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control (awake) measurements of MAP (mmHg), ICP (mmHg), CPP (mmHg), heart rate (HR-bpm), EEG power (picowatts-pW), and spectral edge frequency (SEF, Hz) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anaesthesia was induced with etomidate, 0.2 mg.kg-1 iv, followed immediately by an etomidate infusion, 20 mg.min-1, iv, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9939">vecuronium</z:chebi> 0.2 mg.kg-1 iv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When early burst suppression was achieved, the etomidate infusion was stopped and tracheal intubation performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The etomidate dose (bolus plus infusion) required to reach burst suppression was 1.28 +/- 0.11 mg.kg-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with awake control values (mean +/- SE), the period from induction to burst suppression was associated with a 50% decrease in ICP (22 +/- 1 vs 11 +/- 1 mmHg, P less than 0.01), but there were no changes in MAP, CPP, or HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decrease in ICP was maintained during the first 30 sec and the following 60 sec after intubation as MAP and HR remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that when etomidate was administered to early burst suppression pattern on EEG, minimal changes in CPP occurred during induction of anaesthesia and a marked reduction in ICP was maintained following tracheal intubation </plain></SENT>
