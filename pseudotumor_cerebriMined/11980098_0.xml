<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was admitted to our hospital for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was BIH as continuous monitoring of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) showed high basal pressure with intermittent plateau waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten months after successful ventriculoperitoneal shunting, he presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> again due to shunt malfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSFP monitoring showed the same findings as before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) using the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi>-labeled water autoradiographic method with simultaneous recording of lumbar CSFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rCBF values of the cerebral cortex, white matter, thalamus, cerebellar cortex, and pons were evaluated during both the plateau waves and the intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In spite of severely reduced cerebral perfusion pressure, rCBF during the plateau waves was not reduced when compared with the rCBF of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result might explain why patients with BIH show no impairment of consciousness or focal signs during the plateau waves </plain></SENT>
