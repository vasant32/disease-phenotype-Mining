<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that vasodilating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> induce intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A considerable number of papers have reported <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi>-induced ICP elevation during anesthetized operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, except for Gagnon's report, most papers dealt with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study, using an extradural pressure transducer clinically, deals with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> drip infusion and its effect on high ICP state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean ICP value before infusion was 42 mmHg+ 14.8 (N = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three cases out of ten showed ICP elevation corresponding with blood pressure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six cases out of ten revealed ICP <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> corresponding with blood pressure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case did not show any difference in ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference between the ICP elevated group and the depressed group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that very high ICP state, like vasomotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, does not have a potential to open the vascular bed in the cranium and blood pressure <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> infusion causes ICP <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We would like to conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> can be used for postoperative blood pressure control even in the neurosurgical field </plain></SENT>
