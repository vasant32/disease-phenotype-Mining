<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> is associated with recurrence in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of adult patients with IIH seen between 1993 and 2009 at 2 university hospitals were reviewed to identify those with and without recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with documented height and weight at presentation and at subsequent visits were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare mean body mass index (BMI) and percent weight change between the groups of patients with recurrence and without recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The signed-rank test was used for comparing BMI within groups at the various time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty women with IIH were included in the analyses: 26 had IIH recurrence and 24 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with recurrence had greater BMI at the time of recurrence compared to BMI at diagnosis (p = 0.02, signed-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also demonstrated a greater degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> between initial resolution and recurrence (BMI change +2.0 kg/m(2) [-1.5 to 10.8]) compared to patients without recurrence (-0.75 kg/m(2) [-35 to 3.6], p = 0.0009, Wilcoxon rank sum test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients without recurrence demonstrated stable weights (0%[95% CI -9.6 to 10.1%]), while patients with recurrence demonstrated a 6% <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> ([-3.5 to 40.2%], p = 0.005), with an average rate of BMI gain of 1.3 kg/m(2)/year vs -0.96 kg/m(2)/year in those without recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with IIH recurrence had significant increases in BMI compared to patients without recurrence in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with resolved IIH should be advised that <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> may be a risk factor for IIH recurrence </plain></SENT>
