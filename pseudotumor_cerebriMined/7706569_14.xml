<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: An isolated pump-perfused sympathectomised cat skeletal muscle enclosed in a plethysmograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Hydrostatic capillary pressure (Pc), tissue volume alterations and blood flow were recorded at various arterial (PA) or venous (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) pressure levels at a raised tissue pressure (Ptissue) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total vascular resistance (Rtot) and its three consecutive sections, arterial resistance (Rart), venular resistance (Rvenule), and venous outflow orifice resistance (Rorifice), were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increase in Ptissue increased Pc due to a marked increase in Rorifice and unchanged Rart and, when Ptissue &gt; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, by about 90% of the Ptissue increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the raised Ptissue, a PA increase (95 to 115 mmHg) increased Pc (by 3.1 +/- 1.1 mmHg) causing fluid filtration, and a PA decrease (95 to 75 mmHg) decreased Pc (by 2.4 +/- 0.5 mmHg) causing fluid absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rart was unchanged, indicating impaired autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> had no haemodynamic effects when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> &lt; Ptissue due to a gradual decrease in Rorifice towards zero when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> reached Ptissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> &gt; Ptissue blood flow and Pc increased gradually, causing fluid filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tissue volume is increased by raised and decreased by lowered PA, the latter may be of use to decrease ICP in the injured brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53359">PEEP</z:chebi> or head elevation will not influence ICP from the venous side if CVP &lt; ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, the "vascular waterfall phenomenon" was rejected as Rorifice is a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variable fluid resistance </plain></SENT>
