<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>Hyperventilation</z:hpo> is one method that is frequently employed to control increases in I.C.P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is no doubt that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> effectively reduces intracranial pressure, but controversy surrounds the influence that this procedure may inflict upon the cerebral hemodynamic reserve (C.H.R.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The literature indicates that in spite of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral perfusion pressure, associated with raised I.C.P., that C.H.R. may be compromised </plain></SENT>
