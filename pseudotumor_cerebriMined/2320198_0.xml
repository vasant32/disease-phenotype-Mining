<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects on intracerebral pressure, intracranial reserve capacity and CSF absorption resistance, a subarachnoidal haemorrhage was induced experimentally in a cat by bolus injection or continuous infusion of autologous blood into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal bolus injection resulted in a brief steep increase in intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>30 or 60 minutes after the haemorrhage the median intracranial pressure is slightly increased, the reserve capacity markedly reduced and the CSF absorption resistance considerably enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During intracisternal blood infusion there is a continuous intracerebral pressure rise that persists to the end of the infusion and decrease again within a short time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This intracranial pressure behaviour is due to the simultaneous reduction of intracranial reserve capacity and the increase in CSF absorption resistance during the blood infusion </plain></SENT>
