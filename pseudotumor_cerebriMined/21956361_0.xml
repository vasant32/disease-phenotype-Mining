<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LP shunt addresses the cause of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> more directly by effecting a global reduction of intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two cases were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent clinical, imaging, and CSF manometry evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed failure or noncompliance to medical treatment and necessitated placement of an LP shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of data was conducted and evaluation of outcome was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 22 patients who underwent LP shunt placement for IIH, 16 (72.8%) patients had severe and fulminant opening CSF pressures with values of more than 400Â mmH(2)O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among this group, 19 (86.4%) patients reported recovery of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and 16 (72.7%) patients showed complete resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Shunt complications included two (9%) cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1141920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">shunt infection</z:e> that required shunt extraction and antibiotic therapy, and six (27%) cases of shunt obstruction that required shunt revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Manometric predictors for surgical treatment of IIH may include severe and fulminant opening CSF pressures as well as poor manometric response to repeated lumbar taps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lumboperitoneal shunt is easy and effective for treating intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> associated with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Its usefulness can be optimized by meticulous technical placement of the shunt guided by rigorous protocols for shunt procedures </plain></SENT>
