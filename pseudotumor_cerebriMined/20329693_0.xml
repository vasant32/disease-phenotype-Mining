<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> is one of the commonest medical complaints, and ranks high among the reasons why people consult neurologists and general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> patients are, however, managed suboptimally; and indeed, many neurologists find outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> management one of the least engaging parts of their job </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> may present as part of a symptom complex or it may present alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When it is part of a complex, the total presentation of the patient serves as pointer to any underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When it is the sole symptom however, identifying the specific cause can be more difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even though the diagnosis and management of most cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> probably do not require sophisticated neurological skills or investigations, failure to recognise an underlying disorder or an attitude of total neglect can be fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we briefly review some of the disorders reported to have presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> as the sole symptom with the aim of drawing attention to the need for proper attitude to every <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> complaint even when it initially appears to be trivial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> are recognised - primary and secondary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More than 90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> seen in practice are of the primary type, which includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, tension and cluster <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> results from a wide range of disorders which may be intracranial, extracranial or systemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intracranial causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, haematomas, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some of the more common extracranial and systemic causes are shown in Tables 1 and 2 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recognition of these conditions requires a standardised diagnostic approach to history and examination, wherein the patient's history alerts the physician while the physical examination provides support for the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
