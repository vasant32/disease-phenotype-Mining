<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 88 cases the cause of disease was not clear, while 35 patients showed symptoms of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increase in intracranial pressure so that diagnosis was an urgent necessity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With subdural hygromata, clinical results obtained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rises of pressure usually differ greatly from those obtained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> increases of pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diaphany of skull is usually negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fundal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cases only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Critical cerebral pressures were most frequently observed in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is rather difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the case of functional immaturity of the brain localized neurological symptoms are not usually observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cerebral pressure is generally counterbalanced for a long time so that an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral symptomatology is not produced until tumoral complications, shifts in cerebrospinal fluid passages, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial mass</z:e> shifts, or tumoral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups of diseases, symptoms of rises of intracranial pressure were very marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Malformations of the posterior cranical fossa included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusions in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010964" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DWS|DWM">Dandy-Walker syndromes</z:e> and arachnoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the case of severe cerebral malformations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increases in intracranial pressure are sometimes erroneously concluded from an abnormal increase of the size of head accompanied by a complete lack of reactions on the part of children affected with them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> caused by a disturbance of the circulation of liquor are now treated with pressure-controlled liquor drainage systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Critical cerebral pressures may occur if the drainage system suddenly fails to operate properly </plain></SENT>
