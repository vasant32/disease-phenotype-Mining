<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The arachnoid granulations (AGs) are projections of the arachnoid membrane into the dural venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They function, along with the extracranial lymphatics, to circulate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the systemic venous circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disruption of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF dynamics may result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressures</z:hpo> causing many problems including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, as in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the role of AGs in CSF egress, we have grown cells from human AG tissue in vitro and have characterized their expression of those cytoskeletal and junctional proteins that may function in the regulation of CSF outflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human AG tissue was obtained at autopsy, and explanted to cell culture dishes coated with fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Typically, cells migrated from the explanted tissue after 7-10 days in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second or third passage cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated coverslips at confluent densities and grown to confluency for 7-10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arachnoidal cells were tested using immunocytochemical methods for the expression of several common cytoskeletal and junctional proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Second and third passage cultures were also labeled with the common endothelial markers CD-31 or VE-cadherin (CD144) and their expression was quantified using flow cytometry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Confluent cultures of arachnoidal cells expressed the intermediate filament protein vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytokeratin intermediate filaments were expressed variably in a subpopulation of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cultures also expressed the junctional proteins connexin43, desmoplakin 1 and 2, E-cadherin, and zonula occludens-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry analysis indicated that second and third passage cultures failed to express the endothelial cell markers CD31 or VE-cadherin in significant quantities, thereby showing that these cultures did not consist of endothelial cells from the venous sinus wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of the in vitro culture of arachnoidal cells grown from human AG tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that these cells in vitro continue to express some of the cytoskeletal and junctional proteins characterized previously in human AG tissue, such as proteins involved in the formation of gap junctions, desmosomes, epithelial specific adherens junctions, as well as tight junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These junctional proteins in particular may be important in allowing these arachnoidal cells to regulate CSF outflow </plain></SENT>
