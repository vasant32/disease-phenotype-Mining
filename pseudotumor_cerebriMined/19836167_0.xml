<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first case was discovered in a 21-year-old primigravida at 15 weeks gestation and thereafter six evacuation lumbar punctures were necessary, and a treatment by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, 1000mg/day, was prescribed until parturition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Labor was induced at 37 weeks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001562'>oligohydramnios</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second patient, a 38-year-old tertigravida primipara presented clinical signs of IIH at 28 weeks gestation in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022876" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm labour</z:e> after a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038663" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">suicide attempt</z:e> by massive ingestion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was given an evacuation lumbar puncture and went into labour at 29 weeks, after tocolysis failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of IIH is to be done only by exclusion, in front of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biological composition of the spinal fluid at lumbar puncture with increased opening pressure, and after a brain imaging excluding any expansive intracranial process or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Obstetrical prognosis is usually favourable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main complication of this pathology resides in the ocular impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outside pregnancy the risk factors of IIH which have been evoked are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000147'>polycystic ovary</z:hpo> syndromes and blood coagulation anomalies as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> or hypofibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of this pathology should be medical in the first instance and surgical only in the case of resistance or for severe ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
