<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A group of 57 patients was followed up five to 41 years with visual fields, visual acuity, and fundus photographs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Systemic hypertension</z:hpo> was a significant risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> occurred in eight of 13 patients who were hypertensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite suggestions that blind spot measurement is useful for following up patients with this condition, we believe that sequential quantitative perimetry gives more complete information and is essential to rational decision making in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
