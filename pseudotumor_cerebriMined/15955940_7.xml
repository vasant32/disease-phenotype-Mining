<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether serum and CSF vitamin A concentrations are associated with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The serum and CSF <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> concentrations were prospectively assessed in 20 patients with IIH and 20 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CSF <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> concentration was higher in the patient group (median 575.91 nM) vs the control group (median 63.35 nM) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> levels between control subjects (median 896.51 nM) and patients (median 1,002.62 nM) (p = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an association between higher vitamin A levels (&gt; 250 nM) and IIH (p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between CSF and serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> levels in patients (r = 0.82) and control subjects (r = 0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated CSF <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> concentration is associated with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), but serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> level is not associated with IIH </plain></SENT>
