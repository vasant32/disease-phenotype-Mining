<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amplitude variations of an isolated component might reflect changes in a specific intracranial structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen awake patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or head injury underwent ICP monitoring through a ventricular catheter and were subjected to three standardized maneuvers to alter the intracranial dynamics: head elevation, voluntary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 12 degrees head elevation and fractionated CSF withdrawal caused a mild ICP drop and a proportionate amplitude reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the wave components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Voluntary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> caused a comparable fall in ICP, and a disproportionate reduction in the amplitude of the wave components, especially the P2 component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that the decrease in amplitude of the P2 component reflects the reduction of the cerebral bulk caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Head elevation and CSF withdrawal caused a decrease of global ICP but no specific changes in any intracranial structure, and consequently the configuration of the pulse wave remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The establishment of relationships between anatomical substrate and particular wave components is promising since potentially it could be useful for monitoring conditions such as vasoparalysis, impaired cerebrovascular reactivity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
