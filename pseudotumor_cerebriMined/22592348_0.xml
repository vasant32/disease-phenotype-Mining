<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is a condition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) in the absence of space-occupying lesions or other known etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It primarily affects young <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> females, and potentially causes permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a marker for CSF opening pressure in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 20 newly diagnosed, 21 long-term IIH patients, and 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigations included measurement of peripapillary <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and total <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickness (RT), automated visual field testing, and measurement of CSF opening pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An OCT elevation diagram was developed as a new diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic ability of OCT as a marker of increased ICP (&gt; 25 cmH(2)O) was investigated using multiple regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OCT elevation diagrams showed that in 60 % of patients newly diagnosed with IIH and in 10 % of patients with long-term IIH, 50 % or more of the OCT scans (RT and RNFLT) were above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of abnormal OCT scans was significantly associated with increased ICP (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Estimated areas under the ROC curves increased from 77.1 to 86.9 by including OCT in multiple regressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Autoperimetry pattern standard deviation was significantly increased (p = 0.0005) and mean deviation was significantly decreased (p = 0.0005) in IIH patients as compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased peripapillary <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickness measured by OCT is associated with increased ICP in newly diagnosed IIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>OCT may thus serve as a valuable supplement to subjective assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in patients suspected of having IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In long-term IIH patients who have previously been treated, OCT appears to be of limited value in predicting ICP </plain></SENT>
