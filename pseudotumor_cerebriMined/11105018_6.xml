<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the morphologic changes of the pituitary gland in patients with the clinical diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Qualitative and quantitative analyses of pituitary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were performed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (n = 23), patients with the clinical diagnosis of IIH (n = 40), and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (AICP; n = 37) caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> head trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The loss of pituitary height (concavity) on the sagittal T1-weighted image was classified into five categories: I = <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, II = superior concavity that was mild (&lt;(1/3) the height of the sella), III = moderate (between (1/3) and (2/3) concavity of height of sella), IV = severe (&gt;(2/3) concavity of height of sella), and V = empty sella </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The area ratio of pituitary gland to sella turcica measured in the midsagittal plane was quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed to correlate with magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using moderate concavity (&gt;(1/3)) as the minimum criterion for abnormality, IIH patients had an 85% incidence of morphologic changes with 80% sensitivity and 92% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Empty sella (almost complete concavity of the sella) was found in only 2.5% of patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of the pituitary gland/sella turcica area ratio showed a significant decrease in patients with IIH (P &lt; 0.0001) but no significant difference between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and AICP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A posterior deviation of the pituitary stalk was seen in 43% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No enlargement of the ventricles or sulcal effacement was seen in IIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Routine brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examination of patients with IIH frequently shows morphologic changes of the pituitary gland ranging from various degrees of concavity to (rarely) the extreme case of an empty sella </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The etiology is unknown and may be related to the severity and duration of elevated CSF pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such findings may be useful to facilitate the diagnosis of IIH, particularly in patients with equivocal clinical findings or when IIH is not suspected </plain></SENT>
