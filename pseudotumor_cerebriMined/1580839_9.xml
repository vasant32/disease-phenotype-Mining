<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Possibilities include surgical production of a cerebrospinal fluid filtration outlet or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> in the subarachnoid space around the nerve in the vicinity of the fenestration site, with shifting of the pressure gradient from the nerve head to the retrobulbar portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients who underwent successful optic nerve-sheath fenestration developed a cystlike structure contiguous to the fenestration site, apparently in direct communication with the optic nerve sheaths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was shown on magnetic resonance imaging (one patient) and orbital echography (both patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These previously unreported observations may support the hypothesis that fenestration works by creating a filtration apparatus that controls the intravaginal pressure in the subarachnoid space surrounding the orbital segment of the optic nerve </plain></SENT>
