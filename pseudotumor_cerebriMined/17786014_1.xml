<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, valve upgrade and/or endoscopic third ventriculostomy, which have the merit of no additional shunting, were introduced for the treatment of slit ventricle syndrome, because lumboperitoneal shunting entails various complications including development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo>, shunt malfunction, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the safety of valve upgrading is not confirmed, especially in a child with slit ventricle syndrome developed as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 5-year-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, intermittent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and sudden deterioration of visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His cerebrospinal pressure during lumbar puncture was 69 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> and his magnetic resonance imaging revealed only small ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunt resulting in dramatic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four months later, he returned with recurrent spontaneous valve malfunction with recurrent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and visual deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After shunt revision with a programmable valve, his intermittent valve malfunction was improved by upgrading the valve opening pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, his visual acuity became progressively aggravated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He underwent a lumboperitoneal shunt with low-pressure valve, which resulted in the disappearance of intermittent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and a deterioration of visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that valve pressure upgrade in children with slit ventricle syndrome after ventriculoperitoneal shunt for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> may produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> deterioration of vision that had already been compromised, even within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial pressure range and with improvement of associated symptoms </plain></SENT>
