<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To develop a method for derivation of the cranial-spinal compliance distribution, assess its reliability, and apply to <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> female patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phase contrast-based measurements of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows to, from, and between the cranial and spinal canal compartments were used with lumped-parameter modeling to estimate systolic volume and pressure changes from which cranial and spinal compliance indices are obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proposed MRI indices are analogous to pressure volume indices (PVI) currently being measured invasively with infusion-based techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The consistency of the proposed method was assessed using MRI data from seven aged healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurement reproducibility was assessed using five repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans from one subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method was then applied to compare spinal canal compliance contribution in seven IIH patients and six matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the healthy subjects, as expected, spinal canal contribution was consistently larger than the cranial contribution (average value of 69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measurement variability was 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In IIH, the spinal canal contribution is significantly smaller than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (60 versus 78%, P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An MRI-based method for derivation of compliance indices analogous to PVI has been implemented and applied to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The application of the method to <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> IIH patients suggests a spinal canal involvement in the pathophysiology of IIH </plain></SENT>
