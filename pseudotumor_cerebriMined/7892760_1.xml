<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 2-year hospital-based prospective study was conducted in two hospitals to identify the clinical characteristics and risk factors of patients with confirmed aseptic intracranial venous occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 21 patients were identified, representing 0.9% of the total neurological admissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Men were more commonly affected than women; 81% of the patients presented in a clinical picture indistinguishable from idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors included <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease in 4, the puerperium in 3, thrombophelia in 3, familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> in 2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in 1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> in 1, and the contraceptive pill in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aseptic intracranial venous occlusive disease proved to be not rare in Arabs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It should be considered seriously in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, particularly in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several risk factors were incriminated </plain></SENT>
