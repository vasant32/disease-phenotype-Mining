<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous pressure measurements using the traditional microcatheter technique can be cumbersome, time consuming and potentially unreliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire conducts pressure electrically and can be used as a guidewire for intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been validated in interventional cardiology procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We describe our initial clinical experience with the PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire system for cerebral venous manometry and intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Cerebral venous pressure gradient was directly measured by advancing the pressure wire across a region of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pressure wire was also used as a guidewire for intravascular ultrasound, angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire successfully navigated the intracranial venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transfer of devices over the guidewire in a monorail fashion was uncomplicated, and measurement of sinus pressure between the steps of the intervention was efficiently performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire system provided a safe, fast and effective method for intracranial venous sinus manometry and intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It has several potential advantages over the traditional microcatheter method, including efficiency, accuracy and cost </plain></SENT>
