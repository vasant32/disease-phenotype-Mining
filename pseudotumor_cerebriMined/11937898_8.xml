<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To characterize the clinical features of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) fulfilling the Modified Dandy Criteria who were diagnosed at or after the age of 44 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records between 1987 and 1999 of 14 patients at a single institution who were diagnosed as having PTC at 44 years of age or older according to the Modified Dandy Criteria: neurologic manifestations attributable to generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrospinal fluid composition demonstrated by lumbar puncture, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or small ventricles demonstrated by neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We documented presenting symptoms and signs, significant medical conditions, and visual field follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were nine women and five men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (64%) were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients (36%) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients (29%) had an identifiable cause of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, including two with transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, one with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001648'>cor pulmonale</z:hpo>, and one with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> withdrawal after prolonged administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 2 years of 12 patients, visual fields remained stable in 8, improved in 3, and worsened in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with patients who have idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, our small series of 14 patients diagnosed after the age of 44 years were more often men, were less often <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, were less symptomatic, and had identifiable causes of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in a substantial minority (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The visual prognosis in this age group is generally good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because the nonidiopathic causes of PTC would be overlooked by adhering to the Modified Dandy Criteria, we propose a modification that excludes patients who have dural venous sinus disease demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging and those who may be exposed to medications or toxins or have systemic disorders that are known to increase intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
