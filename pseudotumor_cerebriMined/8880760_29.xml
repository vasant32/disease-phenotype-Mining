<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The beaten copper appearance of the cranium, as well as other cranial radiographic and computed tomographic findings in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, is often interpreted by clinicians as evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a correlation between radiological findings and ICP measurements has not been previously demonstrated, and their usefulness in detecting elevated ICP has not been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To address those issues, 123 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> who had cranial radiographs and ICP monitoring were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess the specificity of certain radiological findings to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, cranial radiographs of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> were compared to those of age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, findings on cranial radiographs were compared to computed tomographic scans of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiographic findings were then correlated with ICP measurements obtained while the patient was sleeping, which was measured using a Camino fiberoptic ICP monitor (Camino Laboratories, San Diego, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> radiographs were independently analyzed by two radiologists who were blinded to clinical and ICP data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A diffuse beaten copper pattern, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> of the dorsum sellar, and suture diastasis were seen more commonly in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> than in controls (P &lt; 0.05), but the presence of the beaten copper pattern was no more common in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICP was greater when a diffuse beaten copper pattern, dorsum sellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath>, suture diastasis, or narrowing of basal cisterns was present (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although this study demonstrates that some cranial radiographic and computed tomographic findings do correlate with elevated ICP, the sensitivity of radiological methods for detecting elevated ICP is universally low and they are not recommended to screen for elevated ICP in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
