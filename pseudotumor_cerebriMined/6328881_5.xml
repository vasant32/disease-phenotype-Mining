<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The actuarial overall 5 and 10 year survival was 94 and 82 per cent, the actuarial relapse-free survival 87 and 70 per cent, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The male patients fared better, although not significantly, than the females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in relapse rate was found between cystic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cystic processes had a more indolent course, but a fatal outcome was noted in one case (after 21 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No relapse occurred in totally removed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (10 cases), which throws doubt on the need for postoperative irradiation in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the subtotally resected processes (24 cases) radiation therapy seemed to be beneficial, as in 3 of 4 local recurrences geographic misses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> remains probably existed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No dose response relationship was apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The performance status was severely impaired in 11 per cent (3/27 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>Growth retardation</z:hpo> was observed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
