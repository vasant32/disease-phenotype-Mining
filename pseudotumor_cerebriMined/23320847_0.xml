<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To report values of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and optic disc elevation (ODE) obtained with optic nerve sonography (US) in the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment efficacy in an adult with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial measurements of the ONSD and ODE using B mode US were performed in a 45-years-old woman with IIH before and during after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At first evaluation US showed a significantly enlarged ONSD (.68 cm right; .66 cm left side) and the presence of increased ODE (.1 cm right; .15 cm left side) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-punctural assessments showed a bilateral decrease of ONSD (.58 cm right; .58 cm left side), without changes in ODE values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 12 months of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and diet ODE completely normalized (0 cm on both sides) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ODE values correlated directly with ONSD, and both ODE and ONSD values correlated directly with BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlations were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ONSD changes occurred rapidly after the lumbar puncture, whereas the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> required longer to reduce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: US of ONSD and ODE was useful to support the diagnosis of IIH and to monitor the efficacy of diet and pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to evaluate whether this promising technique may be considered a reliable and accurate method to longitudinally evaluate patients with increased ICP secondary to IIH </plain></SENT>
