<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal dynamics has been investigated by statistical analysis of results of computerised monitoring of 80 head injured patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Pinderfields General Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One minute average values of intracranial pressure (ICP), systemic arterial pressure (ABP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), amplitude of the fundamental component of the intracranial pressure pulse wave and the short-term moving correlation coefficient between that amplitude and mean ICP (RAP) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that reduction of CPP down to 40 mmHg was more often caused by decrease in ABP than increase in ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in CPP below 40 mmHg were caused by substantial increases in ICP above 25 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the ICP pulse wave amplitude and CPP showed a significant gradual increase in amplitude with CPP decreasing from 75 to 30 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For CPP below 30 mmHg there is a sharp decrease in amplitude followed by a change in the coefficient RAP from positive to negative values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was interpreted as a sign of critical disturbance in cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
