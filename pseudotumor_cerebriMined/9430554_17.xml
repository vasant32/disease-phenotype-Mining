<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>Visual loss</z:hpo> is the main morbidity of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> grade and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> grade and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fundus photographs of 478 patients with IIH were reviewed, and their degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> was graded using Fris√©n's scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified 46 patients (10%) with IIH and highly asymmetric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, as defined by an interocular difference of two or more grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of these patients with active asymmetry agreed to return for a series of visual tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They underwent three visual field tests-Humphrey visual field analyzer 24-2, motion perimetry, and ring perimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The perimetry outcome measures were mean deviation, foveal threshold, and means for eccentric zones (3 degrees, 9 degrees, 15 degrees, and 21 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients participated also in visual acuity, Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue, Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity, and foveal flicker fusion testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549122" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relative afferent pupillary defect</z:e> was graded using neutral density filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intereye comparisons showed vision to be worse in the eye with the high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the loss with the perimetry tests increased with eccentricity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The measures of central visual function, although in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, were relatively depressed in the eye with high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>Visual loss</z:hpo> in patients with asymmetric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> caused by IIH was most pronounced in the eye with the higher grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Foveal visual functions, although they remained in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, were also decreased in patients with high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In patients with high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> appeared to affect the entire visual field, and the peripheral field showed the most deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our findings showed that high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visual dysfunction</z:e> in patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
