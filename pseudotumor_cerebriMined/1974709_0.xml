<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hormonal changes and clinical features have been evaluated in a 30 year-old female patient examined for a convexity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> and a 20 year-old patient examined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> caused by cured <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data also demonstrated a correlation between an increase in intracranial pressure and a deficiency of hormonal secretion by the hypophysis </plain></SENT>
