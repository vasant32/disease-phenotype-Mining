<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical features of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (CDH) with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (IIHWOP) to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was conducted at a tertiary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases consisted of 25 consecutive patients (24 women, 1 man, 38 +/- 6 years) with IIHWOP diagnosed between June 1989 and June 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IIHWOP was diagnosed if pressure was 200 mm CSF on two occasions and there was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control subjects consisted of patients with refractory CDH who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF pressure on lumbar puncture performed between June 1992 and June 1996 (n = 60, 50 women, 10 men, 36 +/- 11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A structured telephone follow-up was done from July 1996 to March 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparisons made between the two groups included demographics and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> profiles, both at the initial evaluation and at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> characteristics did not differ between the two groups: most had transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> overuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant predictors of IIHWOP included <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] = 13.0) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (OR = 4.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visual symptoms did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of the two groups of patients was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>Pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> suggest possible IIHWOP in patients with CDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> was not satisfactory </plain></SENT>
