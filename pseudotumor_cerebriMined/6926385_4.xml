<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which optic nerve decompression protects the optic nerve is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were reviewed to evaluate the efficacy of the procedure in the treatment of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and to assess its mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e>, 11 patients had visual obscurations and 6 patients had evidence of visual failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, visual obscurations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> resolved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and 5 of 6 patients had no further deterioration of visual function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients had symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> preoperatively and in 3 the symptoms resolved after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients had unilateral optic nerve decompression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> resolved in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient intracranial pressure monitoring revealed raised pressure preoperatively with no significant change in the first 24 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that optic nerve decompression is effective in the treatment of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, has its effect locally, and in some patients may lower the intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
