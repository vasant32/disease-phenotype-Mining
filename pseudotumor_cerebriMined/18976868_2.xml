<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many theories have been postulated to date regarding mechanisms involved in non-enlargement of the subarachnoid space and enlargement of the ventricles in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, but none have been prove to be definite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movement is known not to bulk flow but rather pulsatile flow that develops from the energy of the blood flow ejected from the heart, in an isolated system of the intracranial cavity surrounded by a solid skull, as in the Monro-Kellie hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors attempt to explain the mechanisms involved in selective enlargement of the lateral ventricle in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo> by re-addressing the Monro-Kellie hypothesis with respect to cardiac energy transfer and dissipation by the Windkessel effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors present a concept whereby the large energy of blood flow from the heart that is conveyed to the intracranial artery, arteriole, brain parenchyme, ventricle, and CSF within the confined cranial space as in the Monro-Kellie hypothesis, and which ultimately dissipates to maintain an intracranial energy equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the same context, if, for some reason the intracranial equilibrium in the energy transfer and dissipation is changed or disrupted, then structural changes would have to occur to achieve and maintain a new intracranial equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the above described mechanisms are those responsible for the development enlarged of lateral ventricles in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Structural enlargement of the lateral ventricles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo> is a consequence of CSF pathway obstruction and resultantly increased CSF absorption function in the lateral ventricle which markedly increases the pulsatile CSF energy flow returning to the lateral ventricles, thus causing collision of pulsatile CSF flow with the brain parenchyme at the ventricular wall, which subsequently leads to structural enlargement of the lateral ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, the collision between the CSF pulsation and brain parenchyme pulsation reduces the Windkessel effect of the brain parenchyme which increases the intracranial artery pulse pressure, which in turn is transmitted to the CSF and increases CSF pulse pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This vicious circle results in the high pulse pressure within the lateral ventricle structurally dilating the lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our theory also explains the relationship between ventricle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
