<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated the clinical presentation of IIH of Asians and investigated any ethnic difference in pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten patients who fulfilled the modified Dandy criteria and four with presumed diagnosis for IIH were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one patient (7.1%) was <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> according to body mass index, seven were overweight, and six weighed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was not frequently found in Caucasians with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This data indirectly suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may not play a major role in the pathogenesis of IIH in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Awareness of this is helpful in early diagnosis and treatment of IIH in Asians </plain></SENT>
