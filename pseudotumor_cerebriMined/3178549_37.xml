<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Instead of removing a single, rectangular section of optic nerve meninges, the operation was modified by making at least three longitudinal incisions in the sheath and then lysing arachnoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> with a tenotomy hook </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of the 23 patients demonstrated improved visual function after the initial surgery for a mean (+/- SD) follow-up of 21.5 +/- 12.3 months (median, 25 months; range, three to 45 months) without reoperation or reinstitution or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two patients failing to improve after the first surgical procedure initially had a single meningeal window created and subsequently improved following reoperation with the modified procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 21 patients with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> had improved visual function bilaterally after unilateral surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of the 21 patients needed bilateral surgery, and the other three had minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> in the second eye not severe enough to warrant surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000543'>optic disc pallor</z:hpo> did not predict a poor postoperative result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Optic nerve surgery improved the visual function in six patients who had failed to recover vision after one or more lumbar-peritoneal shunts </plain></SENT>
