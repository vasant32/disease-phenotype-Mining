<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The radiologic diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is one of exclusion, with no reproducible positive features described in the imaging literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography is prone to flow artifacts, diagnosis of secondary intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (SIH) can also be problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular hydraulics can be useful for diagnosis of these conditions when measured by invasive or sonographic means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to measure vascular flow and pulsatility characteristics with a noninvasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with clinical and lumbar puncture findings of IIH or SIH and 12 control subjects were examined with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> flow quantification studies of the cerebral arteries and veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total cerebral, superior sagittal sinus (SSS), and straight sinus blood flows were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pulsatility indices from the arterial and venous flow for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were compared using the Student t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography confirmed that seven of the 12 patients had venous outflow obstruction, and thus, SIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining five patients had IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed reduced sinus pulsatility compared with that of the control group; reductions of 42% in the SSS and 32% in the straight sinus were noted (P =.0001 and.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the IIH group, total blood flow was 46% higher than that in the control group (P =.0002), and SSS flow was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the SIH group, total blood flow was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; however, SSS flow was reduced by 25% (P =.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reduced venous sinus pulsatility is a marker of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> secondary to raised venous sinus pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When suspicion of IIH or SIH exists and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venogram is difficult to interpret, raised total blood flow indicates IIH, whereas reduced SSS flow indicates SIH </plain></SENT>
