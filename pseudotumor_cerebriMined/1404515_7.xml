<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated the use of two minimally invasive surgical procedures, percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>), in 27 patients with severe brain injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 41 +/- 4 years, and 23 (85%) were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were intubated, and 19 (70%) required mechanical ventilator support on the day of PT/<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endotracheal tubes had been in place for 1 to 21 days (mean, 8.7 +/- 0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were stable from their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury; 13 had intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Seldinger technique, as described by Ciaglia, was employed for PT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following PT, a <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> was inserted by a modification of the Sachs-Vine "push" technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We were uniformly successful in placing these access tubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications were minor and not clinically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three of 13 patients (23%) with ICP monitors had a transient rise in ICP related to PT and one of these patients developed local subcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Another patient experienced a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> at the tracheostomy site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of note, there were no <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PT and <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> are readily learned, minimally invasive procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In our experience with patients with severe brain injuries combined PT/<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> is a uniformly safe alternative to gain long-term access to the airway and gut </plain></SENT>
