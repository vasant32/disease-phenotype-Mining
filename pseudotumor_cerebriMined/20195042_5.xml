<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Retrospective descriptive study reporting the rate of occurrence of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST), highlighting the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) in patients with presumed idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study was conducted in the department of neuro-ophthalmology at a tertiary eye care center in South India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from 331 patients diagnosed with IIH from June 2005 to September 2007 was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were: Elevated opening cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure of more than 200 mm of water on lumbar puncture, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF biochemistry and microbiology,and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuroimaging as depicted by computed tomography(CT) scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were: Space-occupying lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, intracranial pressure within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, abnormal CSF biochemistry and microbiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients were evaluated with MRI and MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CVST was present in 11.4% of patients who were presumed to have IIH (35/308) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI alone identified 24 cases (68%) of CVST, while MRI used in combination with MRV revealed an additional 11 cases (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk factors associated with CVST were identified in nine out of 35 patients (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CVST may be misdiagnosed as IIH if prompt neuroimaging by MRI and MRV is not undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Risk factors of CVST may not be apparent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases and these patients are liable to be missed if CT scan alone is used for neuroimaging, hence MRI, combined with MRV should be undertaken to rule out CVST </plain></SENT>
