<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the sensitivity and specificity of high-pass resolution perimetry ("ring test"), 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) and 18 age-matched controls were examined with the Humphrey program 24-2 and the ring test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Goldmann perimetry also was done to determine if defects found with the ring test were present with another method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Testing with Humphrey perimetry revealed defects in 15 PTC patients and four control subjects; with the ring test, 13 PTC patients and two control subjects had abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disturbed areas in the control subjects with both automated tests were not reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Humphrey perimetry had a sensitivity of 83% and the ring test, 72% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The specificities were Humphrey perimetry, 78% and the ring test, 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Qualitative assessment of the presence and extent of damage using the pointwise probability plots and graphically displayed raw data showed good correlation of the tests in 11 of the 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lack of correlation in four of the patients was caused by the presence of a generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> or a peripheral contraction on the Humphrey test; this defect, not present on retesting, may have been related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> or poor motivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ring test is a sensitive and specific perimetric technique in patients with PTC </plain></SENT>
