<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the extracranial venous ultrasound findings in a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) following unilateral radical neck dissection (rND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PTC is known to be a rare complication following bilateral rND, and is caused by venous outflow obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single cases of PTC have been reported after unilateral rND, and are thought to be due to resection of the dominant internal jugular vein (IJV) in the presence of a hypoplastic or aplastic contralateral transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our patient developed PTC despite prominent flow in the contralateral IJV as shown by venous ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No compensatory increase in flow in the vertebral veins was observed, as confirmed by digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the physiological collateral function of the vertebral venous system and deep neck veins was insufficient and contributed to global venous outflow obstruction in our case of unilateral rND </plain></SENT>
