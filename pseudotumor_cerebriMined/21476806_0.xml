<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors aim to identify the characteristics of primary spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea and propose a hypothesis for its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2003 and 2009, 21 patients diagnosed with primary spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea underwent surgery in the authors' hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical aspects were retrospectively reviewed, and their characteristics were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 18 women and 3 men, whose ages ranged from 37 to 74 years (mean 53 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI) ranged from 22 to 58.8 kg/m(2) (mean 31.2 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (85.7%) were overweight, and 18 (85.7%) suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> before rhinorrhea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiological images revealed fully or partially empty sellae in 14 patients (66.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The preoperative intracranial pressure (ICP) ranged from 11 to 28 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> (mean 17.6 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>), while the postoperative ICP ranged from 21 to 32 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> (mean 25.5 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An endoscope-assisted transnasal approach was chosen for the repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, in 95.2% of patients a cure was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rhinorrhea recurred in only 1 patient, and a leakage from a new defect occurred in another patient 4 years after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both patients underwent additional surgery, which was successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period varied from 5 to 75 months with a mean of 34 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had direct or indirect evidence of elevated ICP, most patients presented with symptoms of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), and most patients were women and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Primary spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea may be due to IIH, and it is a rare symptom of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>When treating or monitoring these patients during follow-up, ICP should be controlled, and other symptoms of IIH should be noted </plain></SENT>
