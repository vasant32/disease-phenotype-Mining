<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Continuous ICP was monitored using a fiberoptic extradural sensor in: 1) 259 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> or idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with free cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the craniovertebral junction and Sylvian aqueduct, 2) 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002410'>aqueductal stenosis</z:hpo> with free CSF flow through the craniovertebral junction, and 3) 97 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximum ICP difference (DeltaICP) was calculated as the difference between mean ICP in the supine position and minimum ICP value after changing body position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean ICP difference (DeltaICPmean) was calculated as the difference between the mean ICP in the supine position and the mean ICP while the patient was in a sitting position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the complete sample, the median of DeltaICP was 13 mm Hg (interquartile range 10-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median of DeltaICPmean was 8 mm Hg (interquartile range 5-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both DeltaICP and DeltaICPmean were significantly greater in patients without obstruction in the craniospinal junction than in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> (P = 0.005 and P = 0.014, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in DeltaICP or DeltaICPmean between patients with Sylvian aqueduct stenosis and those without (P = 0.777 and P = 0.346, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ICP reduction after a change in body position is significantly greater in patients with free CSF flow through the craniospinal junction than in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo>, indicating the difficulty or impossibility of CSF displacement into the spinal canal in the latter </plain></SENT>
