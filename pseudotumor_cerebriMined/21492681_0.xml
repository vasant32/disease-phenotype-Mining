<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The optimal management of medically refractory idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) remains a point of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The senior author's practice evolved after a review of our units' practice in placing lumboperitoneal shunts revealed an unacceptably high rate of complication and revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now preferentially perform custom-designed electromagnetic (EM) image-guided ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement instead of lumboperitoneal shunting in treating medically refractory IIH and present our outcome data with this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective case note review was carried out with prospective follow-up of 17 patients treated consecutively over a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: The article aims to assess the implication of using EM image-guided tracking technology in ventricular catheter placement in patients with IIH and to assess outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients improved clinically at the last follow-up compared to their preoperative condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the patients experienced intra- or perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement using EM guidance navigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in the EM subgroup were cannulated with a single pass, and satisfactory catheter placement was confirmed on a postoperative CT scan with concordant patient symptom improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our series suggests that EM image-guided ventriculoperitoneal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting for IIH is a safe and effective procedure for ventricular cannulation and placement </plain></SENT>
