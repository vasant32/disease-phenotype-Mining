<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report a case of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 62-year-old man was referred to the Kobe City General Hospital with several episodes of transient visual obscuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination on admission revealed bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and a right lower quadrantic homonymous hemianopsia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) showed normalized ventricles and a low-density area in the left occipital lobe without mass effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the findings of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) the occipital lesion was diagnosed as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> did not show mass effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BIH was suspected to be responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In spite of intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> for a week, a lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 360mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several subsequent lumbar punctures failed to improve intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean opening pressure of the last 6 punctures was 392mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean terminal pressure dropped to 32mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> after removal of 10m/ of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A spinal subarachnoid drainage was inserted at the level of L4-L5 interspace for continuous CSF pressure monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean CSF pressure ranged from 20 to 40mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The continuous recording showed typical B waves frequently and plateau waves (A waves) occasionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Removal of only 8m/ of CSF caused significant pressure reduction immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Then, pressure returned to the predrainage level about 35 minutes later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings supported the diagnosis of BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted, which resulted in rapid and complete resolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Postoperative CSF monitoring returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pressure and waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This case emphasizes the usefulness of continuous CSF pressure recording for the diagnosis and subsequent therapy of BIH </plain></SENT>
