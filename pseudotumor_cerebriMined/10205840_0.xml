<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It revealed some variants of EEG tracings, related to different grades of a compensation of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), the changes in cerebral blood flow and a level of a damage of brainstem in dislocation syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with compensated and subcompensated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> a polyrhythmic EEG was registered, while the changes in cerebral blood flow were moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>91% of the patients of these groups completely recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with decompensated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and with mesencephalic level of brain dislocation had slow monotonous EEG; those with bulbar lesion had a suppression of bioelectric activity; a decrease of cerebral blood flow as well as an impaired autoregulation were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5 patients from this group died, and the others survived with neurologic impairments of different degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conclusion was made about the dependence of EEG character in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period of neuroinfection on the grade of the elevation of intracranial pressure and on the level of the brainstem damage and about the possibility to prognose an outcome of the disease on the basis of EEG characteristics </plain></SENT>
