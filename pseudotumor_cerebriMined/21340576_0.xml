<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Standardized cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used in 17 patients prior to and following treatment of IIH and in seven controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance venographies (MRV) were employed for (a) judgement of circumscript dural sinus stenoses and (b) computation of sinus volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional areas (CSA) of the superior sagittal sinuses (SSS) were measured on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of the initial MRIs were compared to those on follow-up MRIs and to results of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stenoses of the transverse sinuses (TS) resulting in cranial venous outflow obstruction (CVOO) were present in 15/17 (88%) patients, normalizing in 7/15 cases (47%) after treatment of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CVOO was not detected in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Segmentation of MRV revealed decreased dural sinus volumes in patients with IIH as compared to controls (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sinus volumes increased significantly with normalization of intracranial pressure independent from disappearing of TS stenoses (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CSA of the SSS were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on the initial MRIs of patients with IIH and increased on follow-up after treatment (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, volumetries displayed overlap in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IIH not only exhibit bilateral stenoses of the TS as has been reported, but volume changes of their entire dural sinus system also occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The potential etiopathological and diagnostic roles of these changes are discussed </plain></SENT>
