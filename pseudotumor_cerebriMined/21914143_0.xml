<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose:  Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is a condition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> of unknown aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with IIH usually suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and visual disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High intracranial pressure despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ventricle size and negative MRI indicate perturbed water flux across cellular membranes, which is provided by the brain water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IIH could be associated with malfunctioning intracerebral water homeostasis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reabsorption based on functional or regulatory alterations of AQP4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods:  Clinical data, blood and CSF samples were collected from 28 patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics were assessed, and a genetic association study was performed by sequencing the AQP4 gene on chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic data were compared with 52 healthy controls and matched by age, sex and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chi-square test and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used in the search of a genotype-phenotype association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results:  While the majority of patients responded to medical treatment, four required shunt application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>, except one, had a good visual outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 24 AQP4 gene SNPs showed no association with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Full cross-validation of the LDA modelling resulted in only 55.1% correct classification of the cases and controls, with a corresponding estimated p-value 0.37 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:  Our genetic case-control study did not indicate an association between AQP4 gene variants and IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the theory of an etiopathogenic link between IIH and AQP4 is tempting, and discussed in this article </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Association studies with large sample size are difficult to perform owing is the rarity of the condition </plain></SENT>
