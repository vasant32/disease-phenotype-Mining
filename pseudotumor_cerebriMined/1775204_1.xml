<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001762'>diuresis</z:mp> and the maintainance of intravascular volume are supposed to be the main advantages of hypertonic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="26710">sodium chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Volume overload and toxic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperosmolality</z:e> from frequent application of such solutions are possible disadvantages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presented experiments checked the time course of intravascular volume shifts after a 100 ml 1-molar saline bolus in 14 patients during neurosurgery using plasma protein concentration changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An initial intravascular volume expansion of about 270 ml remained quite unchanged for the first 8 minutes, followed by a nearly linear decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extrapolation of the curves demonstrated that the preinfusion state would have been reached after about 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Osmolality remained increased by about 4 mosmol/kg 15 min after the bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus it appears that repetitive infusion of these amounts of hypertonic saline will cause no serious volume overload if 30 minutes intervals are kept, but osmolality should be checked before each bolus </plain></SENT>
