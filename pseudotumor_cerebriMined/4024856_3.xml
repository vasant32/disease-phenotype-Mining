<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to delineate the critical blood flow pattern during the Cushing response in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, regional cerebral blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres in 12 anesthetized dogs at <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> caused either by expansion of an epidural supratentorial balloon or by cisternal infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebrospinal fluid pressures were recorded and the local cerebral perfusion pressure calculated in various cerebrospinal compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 8 dogs of the balloon expansion group, the systemic arterial pressure was unmanipulated in 4, while it was kept at a constant low level (48 and 70 mm Hg) in 2 dogs and, in another 2 dogs, at a constant high level (150 and 160 mm Hg) induced by infusion of Aramine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo>, regional cerebral blood flow had a stereotyped pattern and was largely independent of the blood pressure level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, concomitant pressure gradients between the various cerebrospinal compartments varied markedly in the 3 animal groups, increasing with higher arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow decreased by 85-100% supratentorially and by 70-100% in the upper brain stem down to the level of the upper pons, while changes in the lower brain stem were minor, on the average 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When intracranial pressure was raised by cisternal infusion in 4 dogs, the supratentorial blood flow pattern at <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> was approximately similar to the flow pattern in the balloon inflation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, blood flow decreased markedly (74-85%) also in the lower brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results constitute another argument in favour of the Cushing response in supratentorial expansion being caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The critical ischemic region seems to be located rostrally to the oblongate medulla, probably in the pons </plain></SENT>
