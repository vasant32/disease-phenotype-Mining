<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the frequency of orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (OE) in patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 30 women with IIH for evidence of OE by comparing <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and water excretion in the recumbent and standing postures and morning and evening body weights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were compared with findings in 30 women with OE, 22 weight-matched <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, and 20 lean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of treatment with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic agents</z:chebi> was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven percent of IIH patients had evidence of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and 80% had significant orthostatic retention of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> or water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excretion of a standard saline load and of a tap water load was significantly impaired in the upright posture in the IIH and OE patients compared with the lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">Diuretic</z:chebi> therapy induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (up to 9 kg) and decreased mean <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> from morning to evening in 5 of 12 patients treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In seven patients also treated with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic</z:chebi> drugs, the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi>-induced morning <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and morning to evening <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> were both significantly improved with the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapy reduced the frequency or severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> in seven patients and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in four patients who received no other concurrent treatment for IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The orthostatic retention of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and water and the consequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is very similar in IIH and OE patients, suggesting a common pathogenesis for both disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">Diuretic</z:chebi> therapy, dietary salt and water restriction, and planned periods of recumbency merit study as a treatment for these patients </plain></SENT>
