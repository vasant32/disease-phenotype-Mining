<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion in treating idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) is disputed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We conducted a 10-year, retrospective case note review to evaluate the effects of CSF diversion in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptoms, signs and details of shunt type, complications and revisions were documented at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-three IIH patients were shunted [predominantly lumboperitoneal (92%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common symptom pre-surgery was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-operatively, significantly fewer patients experienced declining vision and visual acuity improved at 6 (p = 0.001) and 12 months (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> continued in 68% at 6 months, 77% at 12 months and 79% at 2 years post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, post-operative low-pressure <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> occurred in 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Shunt revision occurred in 51% of patients, with 30% requiring multiple revisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that CSF diversion reduces visual decline and improves visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> remained in the majority of patients and low-pressure <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> frequently complicated surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Over half of the patients required shunt revision with the majority of these requiring multiple revisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest that CSF shunting should be conducted as a last resort in those with otherwise untreatable, rapidly declining vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alternative treatments, such as weight reduction, may be more effective with less associated morbidity </plain></SENT>
