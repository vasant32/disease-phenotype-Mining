<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High levels of PaCO2 as tolerated for permissive <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> are deleterious for cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In such circumstances, tracheal gas insufflation (TGI), which was recently proposed to reduce PaCO2, may be of benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the cases of two patients with severe adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome and head trauma complicated with elevated ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The introduction of TGI decreased PaCO2 by 17 and 26%, decreased ICP, and increased calculated cerebral perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TGI could be added to a pressure-targeted strategy of ventilatory management when severe adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome was associated to an intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
