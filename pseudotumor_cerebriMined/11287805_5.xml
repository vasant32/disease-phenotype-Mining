<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were three groups: 5 patients with treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> with an apparently functioning shunt, 4 patients with untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, clinically and radiologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo>, and 3 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, 2 treated and 1 untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the magnitude of the intracranial pressure changes varied, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had abnormal baseline pressures together with repeated A and B waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In no case was there any clinical manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases ventricular size remained constant over the period of evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical and pathophysiological implications of these findings are discussed </plain></SENT>
