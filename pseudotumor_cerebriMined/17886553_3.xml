<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors evaluated the characteristics of patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), and compared laser scanning tomography (LST) measurements of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> with the clinical parameters and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressures obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four patients were included in this study; these individuals included 21 women and three men with a mean age of 35.5 +/- 9.7 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 35.4 +/- 8.3 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors conducted a prospective follow-up study over a period of 12 months through a series of four consultations with each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients had a mean time to treatment of 6.2 +/- 7.9 months and, at the time of diagnosis, suffered a mean of 2.8 +/- 1.3 symptoms each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laser scanning tomography of the optic disc revealed a mean global rim volume of 1.693 +/- 1.662 mm3 and a mean height of 0.604 +/- 0.306 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean CSF opening pressure was 31.3 +/- 6.3 cm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients improved significantly with regard to clinical parameters (p &lt; 0.001), BMI reduction (p &lt; 0.001), and reduction of visual field deficits (p = 0.007); visual acuity remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at each successive consultation, the CSF opening pressure was lower than it had been at the previous consultation (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laser scanning tomography measurements demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in both optic disc parameters over the follow-up period (global rim volume, p = 0.044; mean height, p = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CSF opening pressure and the LST measurements correlated significantly with the number of symptoms (CSF opening pressure, p &lt; 0.001; global rim volume, p = 0.001; mean height, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in detecting the presence of clinical symptoms was 0.87 for CSF opening pressure, 0.7 for rim volume, and 0.81 for mean optic disc height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laser scanning tomography measurements are useful for evaluating the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in patients with IIH and correspond well with clinical data and measurements of CSF opening pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If a diagnosis of IIH is established, LST measurements may replace repeated CSF opening pressure measurements in follow-up monitoring </plain></SENT>
