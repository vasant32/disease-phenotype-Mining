<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several indices were used to estimate ventricular size from computerized tomography scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results show a linear relationship between ventricular size and the elasticity slope which relates the natural logarithm of pressure to volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It follows that a hydrocephalic patient should show a greater intracranial pulse amplitude at a given pressure than does a patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although these elasticity changes may simply be the result of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo>, it seems possible that the pressure-volume elasticity relationship may be of etiological importance in disorders of the CSF system </plain></SENT>
