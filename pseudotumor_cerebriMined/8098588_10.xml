<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite adequate sedation, moderate to severe diaphragmatic movements (bucking and coughing) in response to carinal stimulation with significant increases in intracranial pressure (A: 18 SD 7 to 24 SD 8 mmHg; B: 19 SD 7 to 27 SD 5 mmHg) and subsequent decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure (group A: 69 SD 11 to 63 SD 8 mmHg; group B: 63 SD 11 to 59 SD 17 mmHg) could be observed without muscle relaxation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Slight diaphragmatic movements could be elicited in only two patients in group A and in two patients in group B during tracheal suction; intracranial pressure (group A: 20 SD 8 to 20 SD 8 mmHg; group B: 19 SD 7 to 19 SD 7 mmHg) and cerebral perfusion pressure (group A: 65 SD 13 to 65 SD 13 mmHg; group B: 66 SD 12 to 65 SD 11 mmHg) remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
