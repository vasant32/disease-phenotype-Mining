<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lumboperitoneal (LP) shunts have traditionally been used in patients with IIH due to a frequently undersized ventricular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the advent of image-guided stereotaxis has enabled effective ventricular catheter placement in patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe the first large series of frameless stereotactic ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting for patients with slit ventricles and IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe the frameless stereotactic VP shunting technique for IIH in 32 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes following shunt placement, time to shunt failure, and etiology of shunt failure are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 21 patients underwent 32 ventricular shunting procedures (20 VP, 10 ventriculoatrial, 2 ventriculopleural) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred percent of shunts were successfully placed into slit ventricles, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> requiring only one pass of the catheter under stereotactic guidance to achieve the desired location and CSF flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no procedure-related complications and each ventricular catheter showed rapid egress of CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> (100%) patients experienced significant improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> immediately after shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten percent of ventricular shunts failed at 3 months after insertion, 20% failed by 6 months, 50% failed by 12 months, and 60% failed by 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Shunt revision was due to distal obstruction in 67%, overdrainage in 20%, and distal catheter migration or CSF leak in 6.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no shunt revisions due to proximal catheter obstruction or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1141920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">shunt infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience treating patients with IIH, frameless stereotactic ventricular CSF shunts were extremely effective at treating IIH-associated intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and continued to provide relief in nearly half of patients 2 years after shunting without many of the shunt-related complications that are seen with LP shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Placing ventricular shunts using image-guided stereotaxis in patients with IIH despite the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> is an effective, safe treatment option </plain></SENT>
