<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prolonged simultaneous recordings of CSF pressure, through a lumbar needle, and of EEG showed that these episodes resulted from bouts of elevation of CSF pressure (120 mm Hg systolic pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of the increased pressure waves, described as Lundberg 's A waves or plateau waves, is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analogy between EEG records and those observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects during Valsalva's manoeuvre is a further argument in favor of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> during the increased pressure plateau, this being apparently the explanation for the clinical disorders </plain></SENT>
