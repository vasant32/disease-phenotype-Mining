<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the severely raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure commonly associated with this condition is largely unexplained, because the majority of patients have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cranial computed tomographic (CT) findings when diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of cryptococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> in a child who had severely raised CSF pressure on admission, and in whom repeated CT scanning showed progressive enlargement of the subarachnoid space and ventricular system during the course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The normalization of these spaces after ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting suggests a distal CSF block as the cause of the raised ICP in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CSF pressure was monitored and treatment with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> resulted in a definite, but slow and incomplete lowering of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal therapy with hyaluronidase had no beneficial effect on either ICP or the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
