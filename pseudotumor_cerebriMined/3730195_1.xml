<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale score was less than 8 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and the age ranged from 17 to 75 years (mean of 46 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured from the extradural space using Gaeltec transducer and systemic blood pressure was simultaneously recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Common carotid blood flow velocity (CBFV) was recorded on both sides and mean velocity (M), diastolic mean velocity (Md) and mean blood flow were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities on <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEPs</z:chebi> were graded into 4 categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>M and Md values on CBFV were significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01) lowered on affected side (main lesion side) even when ICP was staying less than 20 mmHg comparing with control value obtained from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (M: 19.48 +/- 3.52, Md: 15.98 +/- 2.01 cm/sec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the increase of ICP more than 21 mmHg, CBFV on the contralateral side was also decreased and M as well as Md values were maintained at the lowered level during 21 to 60 mmHg of ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant rapid decrease of CBFV was observed at extreme intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> more than 61 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lowered CBFV was also noted when cerebral perfusion pressure was reduced less than 50 mmHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
