<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recorded steady-state pattern electroretinograms (PERGs) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to sinusoidal gratings of variable spatial frequency [0.6, 1.0, 1.4, 2.2 and 4.8 cycles/degree (cpd)] in 18 patients with IIH and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and in 21 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spatial frequency selective reductions in the mean PERG (at 1-4.8 cpd) and VEP (at 4.8 cpd) amplitudes were found in patients in comparison with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response functions of amplitude versus spatial frequency of patients' PERG and VEP displayed a low-pass shape, whereas in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects PERG and VEP functions showed a band-pass and a high-pass shape, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PERG and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000649'>VEP abnormalities</z:hpo> were found in 14 (77.7%) and 10 (55.5%) out of 18 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of these abnormalities involved only selected spatial frequencies (1.4-4.8 cpd) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate spatial-frequency-dependent functional losses on both PERG and VEP in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, and suggest a potential value of these responses for detecting subtle visual abnormalities in IIH </plain></SENT>
