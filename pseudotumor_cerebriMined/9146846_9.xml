<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Thiopentone is administered as a racemate (rac-thiopentone) for induction of anaesthesia as well as for neurological and neurosurgical emergencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rac-thiopentone have been extensively studied but the component R-(+)- and S-(-)- enantiomers, until very recently, have been largely ignored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study analyses the pharmacokinetics of R-(+)- and S-(-)-thiopentone in 12 patients given rac-thiopentone intravenously for induction of anaesthesia and five patients given a prolonged infusion of rac-thiopentone used for treatment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean total body clearance (CLT) and apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) showed trends towards higher values for R-(+)- than for S-(-)-thiopentone in both patient groups; CLT and Vss of unbound fractions of R-(+)- and S-(-)-thiopentone, however, did not show these trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time courses of R-(+)- and S-(-)- thiopentone serum concentrations were so similar that EEG effect could not be attributed to one or other enantiomer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum protein binding for S-(-)-thiopentone was greater than for R-(+)-thiopentone (P = 0.02) and 24 h urinary excretion of R-(+)-thiopentone was greater than for S-(-)-thiopentone (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient, concomitant measurement of CSF and serum thiopentone concentrations found that serum: CSF equilibration of unbound fractions of both enantiomers was essentially complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study was unable to determine any pharmacokinetic difference of clinical significance between the R-(+)- and S-(-)-thiopentone enantiomers and concludes that minor differences in CLT and Vss could be explained by enantioselective difference found in serum protein binding </plain></SENT>
