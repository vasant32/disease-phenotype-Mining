<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the unusual development of bilateral myelinated <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fibers (MRNF) adjacent to the optic nerve in a child after treatment of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) with unilateral optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) and to discuss the etiology of acquired MRNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient's clinical history, including visual acuity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">refractive error</z:e>, ocular alignment, fundus examination, and optic nerve photographs, was retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A literature review was performed for acquired MRNF in children using PubMed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the demographic and clinical findings of our patient were compared with those of previously reported cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The child developed bilateral MRNF adjacent to the optic nerve 5 months after unilateral ONSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In reviewing the literature, 8 of 10 cases of acquired MRNF in children had previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000587'>abnormalities of the optic nerve</z:hpo>, 4 of 10 had associated bilateral optic nerve head <z:hpo ids='HP_0011510'>drusen</z:hpo>, 3 of 10 had associated optic nerve <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo>, and 3 of 10 had a history of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> requiring surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the etiology of acquired MRNF is uncertain, this case plus a review of the literature suggest that it may be related to changes in the lamina cribosa combined with possible optic nerve injury caused by optic nerve head <z:hpo ids='HP_0011510'>drusen</z:hpo>, optic nerve <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> and that it can occur months to years after intervention </plain></SENT>
