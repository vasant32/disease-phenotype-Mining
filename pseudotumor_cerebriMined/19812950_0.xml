<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are still many important questions about algorithms and clinical scenarios in the context of children with clinical intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> symptoms (IHS) without radiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such conditions could appear in different clinical situations, including slit ventricle syndrome, overdrainage syndrome, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volume <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, or idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many articles have defined specific treatment strategies for various forms of IHS, including ventriculoperitoneal shunting, medication for shunt-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, steroids, and valve upgrades with antisiphoning devices or programmable systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study is an attempt to define the proper diagnostic procedures and treatment options for patients with various forms of IHS without evident neuroradiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors discuss possible pathological mechanisms leading to IHS in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors present six children treated in their center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the children presented clinical manifestation of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> without evident neuroradiological findings in CT and/or MRI examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three cases, the final diagnosis was slit ventricle syndrome; in two cases, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volume <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>; in another case, idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment options included short-term steroid (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>) administration and ventriculoperitoneal shunting using programmable systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one case of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, ICP monitoring was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors discuss possible diagnostic and treatment strategies for the aforementioned cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There are still many controversies about management of children with clinical symptoms of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> that are not confirmed in neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It seems that our understanding of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the pediatric population is not nearly as sophisticated or complete as we might have imagined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ventriculoperitoneal shunting with antisiphoning devices and/or short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> administration seem to be the best treatment options in these cases </plain></SENT>
