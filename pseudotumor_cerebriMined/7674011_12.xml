<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores of 8 or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recordings were made of the patients' ICP and mean arterial blood pressure from the nurse's end-hour recording at the bedside, as well as of their CPP, rectal temperature, and standard therapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors assessed the effects of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> bolus (50 mg in 20 minutes) on ICP and CPP; an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> infusion (21.5 +/- 11 mg/hour over 30 +/- 9 hours) on ICP, CPP, rectal temperature, and standard therapy regimens (matching the values before and during infusion in a similar time interval); and discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> treatment on ICP, CPP, and rectal temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> bolus was very effective in lowering ICP (p &lt; 0.0005) and improving CPP (p &lt; 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> infusion decreased ICP (p &lt; 0.02), but did not improve CPP and rectal temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of standard therapy regimens before and during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> infusion showed no significant changes, except in three patients in whom <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> reestablished its action on ICP and CPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sudden discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> treatment was followed by significant ICP rebound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> may be considered one of the frontline agents for raised ICP and CPP impairment </plain></SENT>
