<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> as an associated finding in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective, noncomparative interventional case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men with the diagnosis of IIH seen within the last 5 years at three tertiary care academic ophthalmologic institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> (SA) and IIH were identified and reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two cases of IIH in men were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six cases with SA met the modified Dandy criteria for the diagnosis of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these six patients, one received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> alone, four received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and one was treated with CPAP alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had preserved central acuity (20/20 or better in both eyes), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enlarged blind spots</z:e>, and optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> visual fields after treatment, and one patient had residual visual field loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> optic nerve examinations, with resolution of the optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After resolution of the optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, these three patients were maintained on CPAP but discontinued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients had persistent but improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and are under continued treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and CPAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000543'>optic disc pallor</z:hpo> in both eyes and is stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SA was a common finding in men meeting the modified Dandy criteria for IIH in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> with nocturnal oxygenation may improve the signs and symptoms of IIH in affected men </plain></SENT>
