<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to monitor the optic nerve sheath appearances and orbital changes that occur following this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The eight patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> female with an average age of 37.3 years and a range of 20-58 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The duration of symptoms was 2-6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> and visual obscurations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examination revealed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> investigations, including MRI, biochemical and immunological tests, were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients had fenestration of a 2 mm x 3 mm segment of the medial aspect of the optic nerve sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Imaging was obtained with a 1 T MRI machine using a head coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Coronal, axial and sagittal 3 mm contiguous sections using STIR sequences with TR 4900 ms, IT 150 ms and TE 60 ms were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients showed clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The post-operative MRI findings in four of these included a decreased volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the optic nerve sheaths and a localized collection of fluid within the orbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no MRI changes in the three patients with no clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Decreased CSF volume around the optic nerve and a fluid collection within the orbit may indicate a favorable outcome in optic nerve fenestration </plain></SENT>
