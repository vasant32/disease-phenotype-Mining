<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report 22 cases of intracranial venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and study what is new about that old pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sagittal superior sinus is still the most touched one, followed by the lateral sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Half of the cases are traumatic: their clinical picture consists either of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, either of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and neurological signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Puerperal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sinuses have quite disappeared and have been replaced by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in women taking oestro-progestional agents, whose clinical picture is absolutely the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> are quite less frequent than intracranial abcesses, whose diagnosis must be made first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About diagnosis, the certitude is still given by bilateral carotid arteriography which demonstrates the thrombosed sinus, whereas cerebral scintigraphy shows whether their is an adjacent infarction of venous origin or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment is a medical one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It consists rather of methods to reduce cerebral volum, aiming at maximal use of collateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> should be used only if there is no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of venous origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total mortality is 27% and among survivals there are few sequels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prognosis depends on the thrombosed sinus, on the rapidity for clinical signs to appear and especially on the anastomotic venous collateral ability demonstrated by carotid angiography </plain></SENT>
