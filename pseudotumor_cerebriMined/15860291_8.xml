<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: setting: Two tertiary care academic neuro-ophthalmology units. patient population: Patients with IIH treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>. observation procedure: Documentation of pregnancy outcome. main outcome measures: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> pregnancy, fetal loss, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> for IIH during pregnancy, and there were no adverse pregnancy outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A critical review of the English language literature on the subject failed to demonstrate any convincing evidence for any adverse effect on pregnancy for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> at high doses may produce birth defects in animals, but there is little clinical or experimental evidence to support any adverse effect of the drug on pregnancy outcomes in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the clinical situation warrants the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> in IIH, then the drug probably can be offered after appropriate informed consent </plain></SENT>
