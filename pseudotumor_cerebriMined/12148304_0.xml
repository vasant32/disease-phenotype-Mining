<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among other things one of the more important uses is the evaluation of the optic nerve and its abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One aspect is the use of the stretch-test (originally called the "30 degrees-test") for the differential diagnosis of optic nerve widening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such widening can be caused by solid thickening of the optic nerve and/or its sheaths or by solid infiltration of the subarachnoidal space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More frequent is a widening of the optic nerve as a consequence of sheath distension by increased subarachnoidal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present various cases of widened optic nerve patterns and explain the technique and diagnostic value of standardized echography, especially of the stretch-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In widened optic nerve patterns due to fluid around the optic nerve parenchyma, a decreased optic nerve thickness will be found when performing the stretch-test (positive test result), whereas in solid lesions of the optic nerve no change of optic nerve thickness will be seen (negative test result) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The stretch-test provides a reliable tool for the differential diagnosis of widened optic nerves </plain></SENT>
