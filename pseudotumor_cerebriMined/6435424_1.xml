<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These 11 cases comprised three optic nerve sheath <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo>, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo>, two cases of pseudotumor, and one case each of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878675" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Erdheim-Chester disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Optic nerve sheath <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> could be further differentiated from the other mass lesions by showing the entire length of the optic nerve through the lesion, smooth margins, a fusiform shape, and parallel enhancement of the periphery of the optic nerve even greater than that of the surrounding mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These features may aid in differentiating optic nerve sheath <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> from other mass lesions in the orbit </plain></SENT>
