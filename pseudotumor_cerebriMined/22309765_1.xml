<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the accuracy of individual and combinations of signs on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) in the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional research ethics board without informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients and 43 control subjects were retrospectively identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient and control had undergone brain MRI and MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Images were anonymized and reviewed by three neuroradiologists, blinded to clinical data, for the presence or absence of findings associated with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of stenosis in each transverse sinus was graded and summed to generate a combined stenosis score (CSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated for individual and combinations of signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Partially empty sella (specificity 95.3%, p &lt; 0.0001), flattening of the posterior globes (specificity 100%, p &lt; 0.0001), and CSS &lt;4 (specificity 100%, p &lt; 0.0001) were highly specific for IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of one sign, or any combination, significantly increased the odds of a diagnosis of IIH (LR+ 18.5 to 46, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their absence, however, did not rule out IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Brain MRI with venography significantly increased the diagnostic certainty for IIH if there was no evidence of a mass, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, or sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and one of the following signs was present: flattening of the posterior globes, partially empty sella, CSS &lt;4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, absence of these signs did not exclude a diagnosis of IIH </plain></SENT>
