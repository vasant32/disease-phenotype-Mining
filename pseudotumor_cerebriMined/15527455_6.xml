<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the association between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> treatment and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients from two neuro-ophthalmic referral centers, who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025268" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MEN2a">PTC syndrome</z:e> post-treatment with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>, were enrolled and followed for a minimum of 2 years after cessation of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 243 consecutive patients were diagnosed with PTC; 18 had concurrent history of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> treatment; a third experienced a limited course of illness with no relapses; 12 had a variable course with a prolonged relapsing illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> treatment prior to diagnosis was 2.73 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">Tetracycline</z:chebi>, and especially <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>, is currently considered a cause or a precipitating factor for PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there is little information on the natural course of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> induced PTC, the present cases demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug withdrawal</z:e> is curative only in some patients </plain></SENT>
