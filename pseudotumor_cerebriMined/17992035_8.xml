<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have reported casuistic observations that intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform analysis may be useful in the management of pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We here report our whole patient material of 65 children undergoing ICP monitoring with storage of their ICP raw data files during the years 2002-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively explored the clinical symptoms/findings and radiological cerebral ventricular size before ICP monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean ICP was the actively treated ICP parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using an algorithm for identification of cardiac-beat-induced pressure waves we retrospectively determined the mean ICP wave amplitude and latency, in addition to mean ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome with regard to change in symptoms/findings during a 1-year period was determined in 55 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The material includes children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, shunt failure, benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ICP recordings gave wrong diagnostic information due to bad signal quality in 5 of 65 patients (7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean ICP wave amplitude was increased in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main observations were that the mean ICP wave amplitude (not mean ICP) was increased in those that improved from clinical symptoms/findings after treatment and in those that were unchanged/worse after not being treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Waveform analysis with computation of the mean ICP wave amplitude was more useful by providing information about the quality of the ICP recording, by comparing better with the symptoms/findings at the time of ICP monitoring and by best predicting outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most significantly, 14 of 55 patients (25%) with high amplitudes and left untreated did not recover spontaneously </plain></SENT>
