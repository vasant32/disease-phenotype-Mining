<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is an Institutional Review Board approved retrospective chart review of 410 patients with the diagnosis of IIH evaluated at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics from January 1984 to January 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 410 patients, 20 patients with IIH who were followed over 10 years at the neuro-ophthalmology clinic met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three neuro-ophthalmologists independently evaluated and graded the visual field examinations and optic disc stereo-photographs for each follow-up visit (median = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 20 patients, 11 demonstrated a stable course of disease without worsening in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> or visual field, and 9 patients worsened after a stable course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these 9 patients, 6 patients experienced delayed worsening (range: 28 to 135 months from presentation) and 3 patients had recurrence after resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> 12 to 78 months from initial resolution of the IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> condition that may worsen after a period of stability, warranting long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
