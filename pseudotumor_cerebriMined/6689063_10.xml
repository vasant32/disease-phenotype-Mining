<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The standardized A-scan (Kretztechnik 7200 MA) supplemented by contact B-scan and Doppler ultrasound is a time-tested, highly reliable, and noninvasive tool for the evaluation of patients presenting with signs or symptoms suggesting an orbital lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diseases of the orbital adipose tissue, extraocular muscles, optic nerves and periorbital sinuses are detectable within minutes by the experienced examiner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than 60 types of orbital lesions can then be differentiated, localized, measured, and schematized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the value of orbital CT scanning has been widely accepted, standardized echography is now also being recognized as an important modality in the diagnosis and management of orbital and periorbital disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of standardized echography results in more frequent and more accurate tissue differentiation, specifically: (1) standardized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> patterns closely correlate with histologic diagnoses, (2) vascular flow detection and compression testing (hard or soft), (3) detection and diagnosis of optic nerve sheath distention due to increased subarachnoid fluid (eg, benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>), and (4) greater sensitivity in detecting mild extraocular muscle thickening (eg, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional advantages are the noninvasive nature of the procedure (no radiation) and portability of the equipment </plain></SENT>
