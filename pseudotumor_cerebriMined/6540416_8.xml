<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> was produced by a venous bruit and could be decreased by Valsalva's maneuver, head turning to the ipsilateral side, or by light pressure over the ipsilateral jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correction of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> obliterated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Turbulence, created as blood flows from the hypertensive intracranial portion into the low pressure of the jugular bulb, is proposed as the mechanism producing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
