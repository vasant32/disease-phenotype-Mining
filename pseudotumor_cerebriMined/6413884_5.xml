<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 61 patients with a closed head injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ICP was monitored continuously, concomitant with the administration of 20% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If the ICP remained higher than 25 mm Hg for 10 minutes or more, the patient was included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of monitoring records delineated four variables that were related to the response of ICP to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>: (a) the level of ICP 1 hour before <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> was administered, (b) the level of ICP when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> was administered, (c) the amount of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> that was administered immediately before the resulting changes in ICP were measured, and (d) the cumulative amount of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> given over the 6 hours before the most recent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> dosage was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of the ICP measurements and the cumulative amount of preceding doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> influenced the response of ICP to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> more than did the size of the dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings imply that: (a) the initial administration of more <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> than is absolutely needed may lead to larger doses being required to control ICP and (b) for that reason, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> given on a gram/kilogram, an hourly, or a serum osmolarity basis to control increased ICP has negative long term effects because more <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> may be required to decrease ICP when an excessive amount of it has been given previously </plain></SENT>
