<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These 27 patients were considered appropriate candidates for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002533'>Abnormal posturing</z:hpo> or flaccidity was present in 70% of the patients, and 41% had bilaterally fixed pupils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five of 27 patients had mass lesions requiring operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 patients who responded to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy with normalization of intracranial pressure for 24 hours, 5 died (33% mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 12 patients who did not respond to the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy died (75% mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total mortality in this group of 27 patients was 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the survivors, 69% had a recovery classified as good recovery/moderate disability, and 31% were in a severe disability/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The morbidity and mortality in these patients is high, but comparisons with previous studies show that this is a selected group of severe head injuries with a high percentage of poor prognostic indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> can be effective in lowering intracranial pressure in patients with otherwise unresponsive intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and, by doing so, may decrease the mortality in a group of patients considered untreatable by the usual therapeutic modalities </plain></SENT>
