<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: A collapsible segment in the venous outflow has been noted in many patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mathematical modeling has shown that these collapsible segments can account for the elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures associated with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the model required an elevated outflow resistance of up to 10 times <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to predict the CSF pressures actually found clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurement of blood flow in patients with IIH has shown that inflow rates vary, with higher rates noted in patients with lesser outflow stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to extend a simple model of cerebral hydrodynamics to accommodate a collapsible sinus and elevations in cerebral blood flow in accordance with in vivo measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with IIH underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in which the degree of stenosis on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography was compared with the total blood inflow by using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> flow quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative outflow resistance in IIH was estimated using the CSF opening pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were compared with 14 age-matched control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were divided into 3 groups based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography appearances (minimal stenosis, stenosis of 40-70% and &gt; 70% stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vivo measurements suggested a relative resistance elevation of 2.5 times <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 4.2 times <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and 4.8 times <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the 3 groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was an increased inflow of 1.56 times <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 1.28 times <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and 1.19 times <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The model correctly predicted the CSF pressures noted in vivo, suggesting that high arterial inflow is required for patients with low-grade stenoses to be symptomatic </plain></SENT>
