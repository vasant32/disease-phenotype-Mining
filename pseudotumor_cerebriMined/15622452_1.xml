<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) is associated with humoral immunity, we analyzed immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (Ig-VH) genes of B cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 10 patients with PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using RT-PCR and sequencing techniques, intrathecal B-cell Ig-VH genes were amplified in 6 of 10 PTC samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR 3) and VH genes revealed a polyclonal intrathecal B-cell expansion in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequences showed that one-third of analyzed sequences had a high replacement to silent nucleotide substitution ratio, indicating an antigen-driven T-cell-dependent intrathecal B-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, other one-third had germline VH genes without or with a few nucleotide mutations, suggesting a T-cell-independent natural B-cell-mediated humoral immunity in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that both T-cell-dependent and T-cell-independent humoral immunity are present in the CSF of PTC </plain></SENT>
