<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography was performed on 14 unconscious Kenyan children recovering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024534" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral malaria</z:e> (seven of whom had another scan 12-120 days later) to elucidate the cause of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain swelling</z:e>, defined as a loss of cerebrospinal fluid spaces, was documented in six children, while a further two had conspicuously small ventricles only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the two children with definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> in whom intracranial pressure was monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> or vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> also had widespread low density areas suggestive of ischaemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patterns of damage were not uniform but were consistent with a critical reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure (which was documented in the two in whom this was monitored), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four had serious neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that brain injury in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024534" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral malaria</z:e> may be due in part to secondary systemic and intracranial factors as well as to the direct effect of intravascular sequestration </plain></SENT>
