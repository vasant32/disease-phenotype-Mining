<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To ascertain the annual incidence rate and the clinical features, other than visual outcome, of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) in Parma, northern Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neurologic care of people living in the Parma area is entirely provided by one private and two public hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical records related to IIH were retrospectively reviewed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Parma residents from 1990 through 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients (8 women and 2 men) were identified as having IIH according to modified Dandy criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their age ranged from 16 to 53 years with a mean of 36 years at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The annual age-adjusted rate per 100,000 is 0.28 for the total population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For women in reproductive age, the annual incidence rate is 0.65/100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For overweight women in reproductive age, the annual incidence rate is 2.7/100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate found in this study is lower than the incidence reported in previous US and Libyan studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in overweight distribution is observed comparing percentage of body weight between US and Parma populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are important factors contributing to IIH development, it is possible that their low percentage in the Parma population may, at least partially, explain the low IIH incidence observed </plain></SENT>
