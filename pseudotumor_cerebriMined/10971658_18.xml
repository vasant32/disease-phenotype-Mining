<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the utility of neuroimaging in the evaluation of children presenting with two of the most common forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and to determine the utility and pathological yield of neuroimaging in specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> syndromes in children whose neurological examinations are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients coded for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 784) in the Pediatric Neurology Clinic at Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters between 1997 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age range considered was between 6 and 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study focused on the two most common types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physical and neurological examinations were considered in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred two patients were coded for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> within the defined age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred seven (35.4%) patients fulfilled IHS-R criteria as having uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> examination, and 30 (9.9%) patients fulfilled criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine (9.6%) patients presented with migrainelike symptoms, and 6 (2.0%) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily symptoms, but had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo> present on examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remainder of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> had the following etiologies: 50 (16.6%) with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 22 (7.3%) with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, 20 (6.6%) with posttraumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 13 (4.3%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 11 (3.6%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, 10 (3.3%) with tension-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and 4 (1.3%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 107 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, 42 (39.3%) received CT scans; 2 (4.8%) of which were considered "abnormal." One of the abnormalities was an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cyst</z:hpo> and the other was a dilated Virchow-Robin space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve (11.2%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> received an MRI, 2 (16.7%) of which were considered abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both of the abnormal findings were Chiari type I malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 17 (56.7%) received CT scans, 3 (17.6%) of which were considered abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities consisted of a maxillary opacification, a mucous retention <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath>, and an occult vascular malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eight (26.7%) of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> had an MRI, 2 (25.0%) of which were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One of the abnormalities was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0007099'>Chiari I malformation</z:hpo>, and the other was an occult vascular malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The yield of neuroimaging in children with uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurological examination was 3.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The yield in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurological examination was higher at 16.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities discovered included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cysts</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007099'>Chiari I malformations</z:hpo>, sinus disease, occult vascular malformations and "dilated Virchow-Robin spaces." While none of the neuroimaging findings were apparent clinically, their discovery did not influence the diagnosis, management, or outcome of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>None of the abnormalities necessitated surgical intervention or were associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Therefore, neuroimaging is not warranted in children and adolescents with defined clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> syndrome diagnoses whose neurological examinations are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
