<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of the diagnostic criteria for "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> attributed to IIH" included in the current classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> disorders, particularly as far as the main <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A consecutive clinical series of IIH patients with demonstration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> by lumbar puncture in the recumbent position were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among a total of 22 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was reported by 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients reporting the main <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> features required by diagnostic criteria were: 93 % for daily or nearly-daily occurrence; 71.5 % for diffuse/non-pulsating pain; 57 % for aggravation by coughing/straining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, these three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> features, at least one of which is required for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> attributed to IIH, were present in the vast majority of our sample, suggesting that their inclusion should be regarded as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis of our results may suggest possible changes in the current ICDH-2 criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> attributed to IIH, based on the following considerations: the existence of remarkable differences as far as the relative frequency of each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> feature; the fact that diffuse and non-pulsating pain-included in the current classification as a single requirement-were not always found together; the high frequency of migrainous associated symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000613'>photophobia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002183'>phonophobia</z:hpo> were present in 71.5 % cases) </plain></SENT>
