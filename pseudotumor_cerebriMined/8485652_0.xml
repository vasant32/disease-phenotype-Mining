<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rat <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> models were divided into the following two groups according to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> administration route: intracarotid injection (IC) group and intracarotid injection with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> induced by AT II (IHIC) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> was given, and 30 min and 2, 4, 8, and 24 hr later the rats were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The drug concentrations in the serum, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> concentration in the serum, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue peaked at 30 min in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum concentration was similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> concentration in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was at least 2.2 times higher in the IHIC group than in the IC group at 30 min and 2 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under drug concentration curve (AUC) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in the IHIC group was about 2.2 times higher than that in the IC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> concentration in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain on the drug injection side changed only slightly from 0.5 hr to 4 hr and was about 3 times higher in the IHIC group than in the IC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> concentration in the contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain was very low in both groups at 30 min and disappeared thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intracarotid injection of anticancer drugs with AT II-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> further increases the drug concentration and AUC in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> compared with intracarotid injection alone and can be useful in treatment of malignant <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
