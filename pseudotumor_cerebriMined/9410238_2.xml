<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is based on confocal laser scanning technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Scientific interest has so far focused on the follow-up of glaucomatous optic nerve head damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As parameters such as cup depth and cup volume can be reproduced with a high degree of accuracy, this new instrument may prove to be an excellent tool to follow up swelling of the optic disk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: A total of 21 patients suffering from optic disk swelling of various etiologies were included in a pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements were taken at six different time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum optic disk elevation and the volume of swelling were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity and the visual field were determined, and fundus photographs were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A reduction in optic disk swelling over time may be demonstrated by both morphological parameters and correlates with improvement in fundus changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The change in the volume of swelling is greater than the change in maximum disk elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The course of optic disk swelling differs between patients with anterior ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between our measurements with the HRT and functional parameters (visual acuity and visual field) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HRT is a good tool for the follow-up of optic disk swelling, particularly optic disk elevation due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
