<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To review the symptoms and progression of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (AVFs) and correlate the findings with various angiographic patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patterns of venous drainage allowed classification of dural AVFs into five types: type I, located in the main sinus, with antegrade flow; type II, in the main sinus, with reflux into the sinus (IIa), cortical veins (IIb), or both (IIa + b); type III, with direct cortical venous drainage without venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>; type IV, with direct cortical venous drainage with venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>; and type V, with spinal venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Type I dural AVFs had a benign course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In type II, reflux into the sinus induced intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 20% of cases, and reflux into cortical veins induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> was present in 40% of cases of type III dural AVFs and 65% of type IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type V produced progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> in 50% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This classification provides useful data for determination of the risk with each dural AVF and enables decision-making about the appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
