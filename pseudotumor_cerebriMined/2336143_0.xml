<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was carried out to study the effect of stimulation of the reticular formation of the medulla oblongata on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) in injured brain with increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CBV was measured by the photoelectric method from the parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen hours prior to the experiments, cold induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was produced to increase basal ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 15 cats, electric stimulation produced temporary increases in BP, ICP and CBV and progressive intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was never observed (Group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 9 animals, progressive increases in CBV and ICP up to 50 to 100 mmHg were evoked after cessation of stimulation (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prestimulation ICP in Group B was significantly higher than that of Group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rapid and simultaneous increases in ICP and CBV following stimulation strongly suggested that global increments of CBV secondary to loss of cerebral vasomotor tonus were responsible for producing progressive intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Group B, the stimulation electrodes were invariably located at the area of the nucleus reticularis parvocellularis and gigantocellularis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our experimental results show that in increased ICP a stimulated or irritable condition of the medullary reticular formation will cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> progressive intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
