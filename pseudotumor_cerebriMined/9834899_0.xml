<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We conducted a retrospective study in 20 cases of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) referred to the ophthalmology out-patients department at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Fort de France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives were to characterize symptomatology, severity, disease course and to discuss treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a complete ophthalmological and neurological examination, calculated the body mass index (BMI) and evaluated visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent a CT scan with injection and a lumbar punction with measurement of cerebrospinal fluid pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also specified the treatment chosen and its duration, and the number of recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study included 20 cases, 19 women and 1 man, with a mean follow-up of 28.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average BMI was of 32.2 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients out of 20 were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (75%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them women, so 79% of the women were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (80%), 15 a loss of visual acuity (75%) and 5 transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the clinical examination showed bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Visual field disturbances were observed in 11 patients (73.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Papilloedema</z:e> disappeared after medical treatment of a mean 2.4 months duration for each access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 9 cases of 18 (50%) recurrences were observed after gradual treatment with-drawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The long-term treatment, the side effects, the possible severity of the ocular disease, the difficulties of dietary restriction and the high rate of recurrence, would, for us, indicate a need to reconsider surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We propose to perform lumboperitoneal shunt or optic nerve sheath decompression if medical treatment fails at the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of IIH or in case of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, pregnancy or recurrence </plain></SENT>
