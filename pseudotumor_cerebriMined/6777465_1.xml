<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each method decreased the mean intracranial pressure by about 60% of the pre-treatment level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximal decrease following <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> occurred after 60-90 minutes and generally lasted between three and four hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> did not decrease when repeated infusions were necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rebound increases in the intracranial pressure following infusion were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Withdrawal of cerebrospinal fluid lowered the intracranial pressure immediately and the effect persisted for approximately 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This could be repeated as often as necessary and was without systemic disturbance, although a patent intraventricular catheter was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two methods could be used simultaneously </plain></SENT>
