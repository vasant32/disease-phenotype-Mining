<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After reviewing the anatomical and embryological literature of the transverse sinus, 20 transverse sinuses were explored (in a pilot study of 10 human cadavers) in order to determine the anatomical basis of this stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of septa of varying sizes was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the presence of a large septum is one of the causes of venographic cryptic stenosis observed in these patients and might be one of the aetiological factors involved in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
