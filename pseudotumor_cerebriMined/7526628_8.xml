<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Volume replacement with isotonic fluids not only is therapeutically of limited efficacy but may aggravate posttraumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other side, hypertonic/hyperoncotic saline/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> solution (HHS) shown to restore cardiovascular function in hemorrhagic shock instantaneously, was found to decrease intracranial pressure in experimental head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently the therapeutic efficacy of HHS and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> on ICP was compared at 24 hrs after a focal cerebral lesion and inflation of an epidural balloon in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both solutions given at an equimolar dose rapidly lowered the ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the first injection, ICP reduction was longer maintained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (189 +/- 27 min) as compared to HHS (98 +/- 14 min), while no difference in duration of lowering ICP was found after the second injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Due to its blood pressure effects, HHS afforded a higher cerebral perfusion pressure than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In animals with HHS, the water content of the traumatized hemisphere was increased while the contralateral hemisphere was dehydrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, no differences in water content were found between the injured and uninjured hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of HHS in hemorrhagic shock and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> render the fluid mixture particularly promising in patients with polytrauma in combination with head injury </plain></SENT>
