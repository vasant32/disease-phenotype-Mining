<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on data which suggest that <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> can be of value in controlling the intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> of head injury, intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> was assessed in 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004448'>fulminant hepatic failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> complicated by intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> unresponsive to other modes of therapy and were likely by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published criteria to have little chance of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dosage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> was adjusted incrementally until intracranial pressure, measured by extradural transducers, fell to within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits or adverse hemodynamic changes occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intracranial pressure was reduced, in each case, by 185 to 500 mg (median: 250 mg) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> given over 15 min, and in eight cases continuing infusion achieved stable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the patients made a complete recovery and there were only three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response of otherwise intractable intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and the 38% survival rate was remarkable for a group of patients with such a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
