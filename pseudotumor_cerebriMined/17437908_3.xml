<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overall, 244 children diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were found suitable for the proposed meta-analysis: 132 (54%) were younger than 11 years of age; 72 (55%) were male and 60 (44%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, of 112 older children (age 12-17 years), 79 (70%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association between age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> could be analyzed in 147 patients: only 19 (26%) out of 74 younger children up to age 11 years were reportedly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, whereas 47 (64%) out of 73 older children were found <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in age at presentation, sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, a wide-scale meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> revealed that the female/male ratio in children younger than age 11 years seems to be fairly equal, with a relatively low rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, contrasting to a majority of females in the group of adolescents at high risk to become <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
