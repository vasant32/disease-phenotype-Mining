<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Parents of school-age children with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were asked to fill out a questionnaire and to rank the child's behavioral patterns before and after the diagnosis and treatment of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire was based on Conners' test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten children were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age at diagnosis was 11.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up time was 25 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients (60%) met the definition of attention- and concentration-deficit disorders before diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; 1 patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="31836">Ritalin</z:chebi>) before referral to eye examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the diagnosis was made and treatment was established, 5 patients (83%) reported an improvement in their attention and behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 6 patients, 2 (33%) reported marked improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that attention- and concentration-deficit disorder might be an early sign for pediatric idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in these children may improve the child's behavior, attention, and achievements in school, without the need to resort to other modes of therapy </plain></SENT>
