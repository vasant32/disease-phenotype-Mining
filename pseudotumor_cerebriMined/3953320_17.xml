<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A method is described for monitoring the relationship between CSF pulse pressure and ICP in clinical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly significant linear relationships were found during 65 continuous ICP recordings in 58 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The slope value of this relationship showed a positive correlation with the elastance coefficient, a volume-pressure parameter assessed by bolus injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the correlation was too weak to allow for a confident prediction of the elastance coefficient on the basis of CSF pulse pressure in the individual patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was attributed to the variable magnitude of the volume change underlying the CSF pulse pressure: the pulsatile variation in cerebral blood volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This quantity was calculated on the basis of a mathematical model from the slope value and the elastance coefficient and was found to vary between 0.36 and 4.38 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During plateau waves a disproportionate increase in pulse pressure with the ICP was observed in contrast with a relative decrease in intracranial elastance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was ascribed to an increase in the pulsatile variation in cerebral blood volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that, under certain conditions, the intracranial volume-pressure relationship can be continuously monitored by means of CSF pulse pressure analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings during plateau waves suggest that the pulse pressure also reflects the state of the cerebral vasomotor tone </plain></SENT>
