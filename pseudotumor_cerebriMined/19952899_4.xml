<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 16-year-old woman complaining of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and declining vision in both eyes had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain imaging, and a lumbar puncture showing a moderately high opening pressure (35 cm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrospinal fluid constituents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), she was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, but vision worsened, so she underwent bilateral optic sheath fenestration (ONSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within the 1st postoperative week, vision had improved and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> was less prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, by the 14th postoperative day, vision had worsened and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lumbar puncture showed a very high opening pressure (65 cm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>), so she underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there was a slight initial improvement in vision, it eventually declined further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case emphasizes that ONSF may yield initial improvement in vision and reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> yet not prevent eventual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in this patient resulted from persistently <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> after ONSF or was prefigured before ONSF occurred is unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is a reminder that patients with IIH must be monitored carefully after ONSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If there is a suggestion of further <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, shunting should be considered if intracranial pressure is high </plain></SENT>
