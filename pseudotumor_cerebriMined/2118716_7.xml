<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four methods of infusion were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In group A, 0.5 g/kg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> was infused within 15, 30, or 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group B, 1.0 g/kg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> was infused within 30, 60, or 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group C, 0.5 g/kg <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> in 5% <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> was infused within 30, 60, or 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group D, 1.0 g/kg <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> was infused within 60, 120, or 180 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: (a) In group A, there was no difference in the reduction of ICP among the three infusion rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group B, the degree of ICP reduction increased with shorter times of infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the groups receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, the reduction of ICP was inversely related with the rate of infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(b) In every group, it appeared that the slower the infusion rate of the same dosage became, the longer the reduction of ICP lasted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(c) A rebound phenomenon occurred in 12% of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> groups and 34% of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The dose and the rate of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> infusion did not influence the occurrence of the rebound phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> groups, the infusion method did influence the occurrence of rebound phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our present study demonstrated that there were differences between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> infusion in their effectiveness and in the occurrence of rebound phenomenon </plain></SENT>
