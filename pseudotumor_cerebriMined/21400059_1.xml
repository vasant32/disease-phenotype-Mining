<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients diagnosed with IIH in Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 1981 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, clinical features, laboratory data, treatment, and visual outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients were included, seven female and five male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 32 (range, 13-65) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was found in four (33%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical symptom was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (75%), followed by transient visual obscuration (42%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Snellen visual acuity was equal to or better than 20/30 in 23 eyes, and the only eye with vision worse than 20/50 vision belonged to a patient who had been <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002418" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amblyopic</z:e> since childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>Visual field defects</z:hpo> were detected in seven eyes by either Goldmann or automated perimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enlarged blind spot</z:e> were the most common patterns </plain></SENT>
