<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Included were 62 neurologic patients (37 idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 20 multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, 1 Guillain-Barré syndrome, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo>, and 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average age was 40 ± 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had lumbar puncture indicated as a diagnostic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICP was measured using a noninvasive ICP measurement method, which is based on a two-depth high-resolution transcranial Doppler insonation of the ophthalmic artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> is being used as a natural pair of scales, in which the intracranial segment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> is compressed by ICP and the extracranial segment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> is compressed by extracranial pressure (Pe) applied to the orbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blood flow parameters in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> segments are approximately the same in the scales balance case when Pe = ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had simultaneous recording of noninvasive ICP values and invasive gold standard CSF pressure values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of the 72 simultaneous paired recordings of noninvasive ICP and the gold standard CSF pressure showed good accuracy for the noninvasive method as indicated by the low mean systematic error (0.12 mm Hg; confidence level [CL] 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The method also showed high precision as indicated by the low SD of the paired recordings (2.19 mm Hg; CL 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The method does not need calibration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proposed noninvasive ICP measurement method is precise and accurate compared with gold standard CSF pressure measured via lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
