<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the signal characteristics of the optic papilla (optic nerve head) on routine cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in patients with clinical evidence of optic papilla elevation caused by high intracranial pressure, and to compare these findings with findings in healthy adult volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed retropectively the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging examinations of 15 patients who were referred with objectively <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>decreased visual acuity</z:hpo> and funduscopic findings of optic papilla elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T1-weighted and T2-weighted axial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were obtained by using conventional spinecho acquisitions on 1.5-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imagers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies in 10 healthy adult volunteers without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> were reviewed as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 10 (67%) of the 15 patients, visual elevation of the optic papilla was shown by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 patients, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signal intensity of the optic papilla was hypointense relative to the vitreous of the globe on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the healthy volunteer group, the optic papillae were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> similarly hypointense relative to the vitreous of the globe on T2-weighted images; however, these optic papillae were flat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical examination and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging may show elevation of the optic papilla in patients with high intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, optic papilla elevation has been shown to correlate well with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Actual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> of the optic papilla seems to play little role in the physical elevation observed clinically in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stages of this pathologic process </plain></SENT>
