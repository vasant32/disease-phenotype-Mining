<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In connection with measurement of conductance to cerebrospinal fluid outflow, the concentration of vasopressin in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid was measured during perfusion at a low (less than 10 mmHg) and at a high (greater than 20 mmHg) intraventricular pressure level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean plasma vasopressin concentration was increased from 2.4 +/- 0.4 pg/ml (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) during perfusion at the low pressure level to 4.2 +/- 0.8 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) at the high pressure level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of vasopressin at the low and high intraventricular pressure were 1.2 +/- 0.1 pg/ml and 1.7 +/- 0.2 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, only half of the patients responded to the increase in intraventricular pressure with an increase in cerebrospinal fluid vasopressin concentration exceeding 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study suggest that an increase in the intracranial pressure might be a stimulus for vasopressin release in both the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
