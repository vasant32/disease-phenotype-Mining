<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both groups, we also measured flow velocity in TSs by using single slice 2D-CINE PC acquisitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects with IIH, 3D-PC showed marked flow disturbance in the mid-lateral portion of both TSs when velocity encoding (VENC) was set to 15 cm/s while only a slightly irregular flow in TSs was detected when VENC was set to 40 cm/s or when 2D-TOF was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, 3D-PC (VENC 15 and 40) and 2D-TOF techniques were comparable in detecting TS signal flow in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measures of flow velocity, by using 2D-CINE PC, revealed a three-fold increase of velocity at the level of the flow disturbance in IIH patients compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p&lt;0.0001), suggesting a marked stenosis of mid-lateral portion of TSs in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Setting the VENC to 15 cm/s on 3D-PC MRV may represent the best technical approach for visualizing disturbances of flow in TSs in subjects with symptoms suggestive of IIH </plain></SENT>
