<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a case of a 13-year-old girl with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> refractory to long-term trials of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> at maximally tolerated doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After declining surgical intervention despite progression of her visual symptoms, a trial of bumetanide (0.25 mg daily) monotherapy was successful in resolution of the patient's symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest bumetanide could be effective in the treatment of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, perhaps by restoring the balance between cerebrospinal fluid formation and absorption and/or by altering the volume or ionic composition of the brain's extracellular fluid compartment </plain></SENT>
