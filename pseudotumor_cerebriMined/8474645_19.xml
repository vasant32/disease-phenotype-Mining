<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients also had continuous measurement of arterial and jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation (SJO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transcranial Doppler parameters studied included both mean flow velocity and pulsatility index (PI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful treatment was defined as a reduction of ICP to less than 20 mm Hg with improvement or preservation of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) above 60 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Successful therapy was associated with a significant rise in SJO2 and reduction of cerebral arteriovenous oxygen content difference (AVDO2) and PI only when the pretreatment CPP was less than 60 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increase in CPP beyond 70 mm Hg did not further improve cerebral oxygen delivery and PI, suggesting that autoregulation became a factor above this CPP threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment failure during administration of hypnotic drugs resulted in a reduction in arterial pressure, CPP, SJO2, and mean velocity and in an increase in PI and AVDO2, despite a decrease in ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CPP is the most important parameter to monitor during ICP therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be maintained above 70 mm Hg in patients with severe brain injury </plain></SENT>
