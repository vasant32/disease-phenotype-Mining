<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe our experience in six patients, two who received a bolus administration of 10% DMSO and four who received a 20% solution titrated against the intracranial pressure (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of the patients in this series suffered from severe head injury, and one had a cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> associated with pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first two patients were treated with a rapid infusion of a 10% solution of DMSO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially, the ICP was satisfactorily controlled using this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over time, however, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546817" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fluid overload</z:e>, severe electrolyte disturbances, and an ultimate loss of ICP control occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subsequent patients, a 20% solution titrated against the ICP was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although ICP control was better achieved using this method of administration, problems with fluid management and electrolytes occurred again despite a high level of vigilance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, because of the solvent properties of DMSO and its propensity over time to dissolve most standard intravenous infusion systems, mechanical difficulties in its administration were encountered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of action of DMSO is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It differs from the <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi>, but acts too rapidly to function solely as a <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The drug is extremely complex to use, and difficulties with its administration may make its risks ultimately greater than its potential benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Until more laboratory data are available concerning its use and better delivery systems are developed, neurosurgeons are cautioned against treating intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with DMSO </plain></SENT>
