<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between August 1981 and August 1996, 145 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic protocol was individualized according to the clinical findings and included appropriate radiologic testing, ultrasonography studies, and lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid pressure measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment was directed toward the etiology of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>) was the most common diagnosis (56 patients), followed by atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> (24 patients) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_402'>glomus tumors</z:mpath> (17 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients, no specific diagnosis could be reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thorough history and physical examination are the two most important factors in evaluating patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluation should be individualized and may include radiologic testing, ultrasonography studies, and lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid pressure measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients have a treatable underlying etiology </plain></SENT>
