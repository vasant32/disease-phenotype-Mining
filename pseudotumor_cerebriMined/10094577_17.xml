<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) and establish whether there is a relationship with visual outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To calculate the prevalence and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in a group of patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 34 patients (31 female and 3 male) were recruited between 1993 - 1997 with a diagnosis of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessment included visual acuity, visual field assessment (Humphrey automated and Goldmann manual perimetry), fundus assessment and measurement of body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 70.5% of patients were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and IIH was significant at 8 (95%CI: 2,29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This increased to 17 (95%CI: 5,62) for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> females aged 16 to 24 years and 10 (95%CI: 3,35.5) for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> females aged 25 to 34 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI &gt; 40) was significantly associated with poor visual outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> measures showed generally little change in weight over time and there was no correlation between weight change and visual improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has documented a relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A high degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was associated with a poor visual function and identified as a risk factor for poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> may be an aetiological factor in this condition although it is unlikely to be the sole cause but more probably a precipitating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> is recommended although failure to lose weight is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Any weight reduction programme must therefore be actively encouraged and monitored </plain></SENT>
