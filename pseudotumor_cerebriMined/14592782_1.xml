<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of IdICH and the anatomical and physiological data show that the mechanisms of elaboration of the interstitial fluid at blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) and of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at choroid plexus are very similarly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In IdICH many pathological conditions can induce the simultaneous hypersecretion of CSF and of the brain interstitial fluid and the high intracranial pressure (ICP) of CSF is equalized simultaneously of the pressure of the brain interstitial fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow is maintained quasinormal in IdICH, even increased, so that it occurs a fast absorption of CSF and of interstitial fluid and the brain injury is insignificantly despite the high ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> occurs through simultaneous hypersecretion of the cerebrospinal fluid and of the cerbral interstitial fluid followed by a rapid circulation and absorption of these fluids based on a fast cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
