<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: There are transient intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> cases, recognizable by bulging fontanelle in infants and by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our experience in benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (BIH) cases, excluding traumatic brain injuries, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the entire neuropaediatric database, with 10,720 children in 18 years, 31 cases had the diagnosis of BIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen aged between 2.3 and 8.9 months (75% males), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them with transient bulging fontanelle, and 15 aged between 4.4 and 13.7 years (73.3% females), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> which was subsequently resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 75% of infants had recently finished <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006277" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the older children, there was 1 case associated with excessive vitamin A intake and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transfontanelle ultrasonography or CT was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infants and CT or MRI in every child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lumbar puncture was also performed on 7 infants and on 13 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infants developed favourably in a few days, and children did so between 1 week and 5 months, some with treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: BIH usually has a favourable outcome, although it may take longer in children than in infants, but it can have serious visual repercussions, even <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, so ophthalmological control is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is normally diagnosed by exclusion of other intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRI and lumbar puncture must be done on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children or infants who do not progress favourably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, repeated lumbar punctures and optic nerve sheath fenestration should be considered in those who do not progress well </plain></SENT>
