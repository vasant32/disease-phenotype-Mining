<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This diagnosis, decreased adaptive capacity--intracranial, occurs in patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not synonymous, however, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rather, its use in the patient with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> allows the nurse to identify who is at high risk for disproportionate increase in ICP and decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) secondary to ordinary activities of nursing care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis can guide nursing management to reduce adaptive demands and increase adaptive capacity in those patients </plain></SENT>
