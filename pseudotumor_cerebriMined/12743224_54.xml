<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective controlled study, 29 patients with established IIH as well as 59 control patients underwent ATECO MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a randomized blinded fashion, three readers evaluated the images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a novel scoring system, each reader graded the degree of stenosis seen in the transverse and sigmoid sinuses of each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was excellent agreement across the three readers for application of the grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Substantial bilateral sinovenous stenoses were seen in 27 of 29 patients with IIH and in only 4 of 59 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using ATECO MRV and a novel grading system for quantifying sinovenous stenoses, the authors can identify IIH patients with sensitivity and specificity of 93% </plain></SENT>
