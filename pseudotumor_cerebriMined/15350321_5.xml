<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the reliability of Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm Fast (SITA Fast) visual fields (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VFs</z:e>) in prepubertal idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) and to compare whether age, gender, or severity of visual outcome influenced the reliability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six prepubertal children (&lt;11 years of age; mean age, 7.2 years) with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TESTING: Children were prospectively followed up using a child-oriented program, which included SITA Fast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, gender, and severity of visual outcome were correlated with reliability of performance on SITA Fast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VFs</z:e> using a 1-way analysis of variance, point-biserial correlation, and the chi-square test for independence of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Statistical analyses results that correlated the reliability of SITA Fast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VFs</z:e> with age, gender, and visual outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three children were treated at the age of 2 years and were unable to perform automated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four children were treated at the age of 4 years, 3 of whom were able to perform repeatable reliable SITA Fast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-two eyes of 21 children had an average SITA Fast test time of 4.5 minutes for each eye, compared with 8 minutes using the Fastpac strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age was not associated with reliability scores of SITA Fast tests (F = 0.971, not significant [ns]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gender did not influence the reliability of SITA Fast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> tests (chi-square((1)) = 0.669, ns), nor did severity of visual outcome (chi-square((2)) = 3.348, ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Visual deficits were observed in 55% of patients at presentation and in 27% of patients after resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The SITA Fast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> tests can be performed from age 4 years and offer a reliable method for shortening test time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A child-oriented follow-up program, which entails a shortened testing time, may improve outcome in prepubertal IIH </plain></SENT>
