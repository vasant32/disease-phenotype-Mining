<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the implantation of a small experimental pressure sensor in the skull, most of the subsequent (ICP measurements were made noninvasively by an external interrogator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the initial study of the patient, baseline ICP recordings were made in the hospital before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pressure recordings on a 24-hour basis were continued during treatment, which, depending on the case, was with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>), steroids, or the coperitoneal shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After discharge these patients returned weekly over 10 to 22 months for ICP measurement and for ophthalmological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure before treatment showed irregular variations ranging from 100 to 500 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> over a 24-hour period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of treatments could be assessed in a few hours by the degree of ICP stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Shunt malfunction was detected by a slow but continuous rise in pressure before full clinical signs were evident </plain></SENT>
