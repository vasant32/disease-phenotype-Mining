<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure was elevated from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean level of 6.4 mm Hg by cisternal infusion of mock CSF in steps to 20, 30, 40, 50 mm Hg and finally to the level of systolic pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pial arteries dilated significantly, small ones more than large ones, by 42 +/- 5.6% and 33 +/- 3%, respectively at ICP 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a further elevation of ICP up to systolic pressure, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> diminished to 28 +/- 10% in small, and to near resting calibres in large arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pial veins remained unreactive on the average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grouping into veins smaller and larger than 100 microns of resting size revealed, however, minor though statistically significant 5-10% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of small, and a 5-10% diminution of large veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood flow stopped, when cerebral perfusion pressure was zero, however, neither arteries nor veins collapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present data support the hypothesis that CBF during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> elevation of CSF pressure depends on perfusion pressure rather than local vascular compression </plain></SENT>
