<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each subject, the concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and serum osmolality were rapidly elevated during <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> administration and reached the maximum at the end of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, it exponentially decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a strong positive correlation between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> concentration and extrinsic serum osmolality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The integrated values of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> concentration difference between the central (Cc) and the peripheral compartment (Pc) correlated with the changes of ICP reduction during <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the changes of ICP reduction depend on the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> concentration difference between Cc and Pc </plain></SENT>
