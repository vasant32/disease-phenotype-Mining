<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of disease severity on cerebral blood flow in patients with BIH on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 11 patients (nine females, two males; mean age 30.5 years; range 22-29 years) with BIH were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent CT and MRI scanning which were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CSF pressure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was above 200 mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were under treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (1 g/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease severity was determined by visual field examination and by clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients were categorized into mild to moderate BIH (group I) and six patients had severe BIH (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent perfusion brain SPECT with 740 MBq of Tc-99m-HMPAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain perfusion abnormalities were observed in six of the 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One out of five patients in group I (20%) and five out of six patients (83%) in group II, had abnormal SPECT findings (P&lt;0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In four patients of group II the left parietal lobe was involved and another patient had a right occipital abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The single patient from group I with SPECT abnormalities demonstrated focal decreased perfusion in the left temporal area and decreased perfusion in the left caudate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with severe degree of BIH have a higher incidence of cerebral perfusion abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This group may have an increased risk of cerebrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The continuous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> which affects the vascular autoreactivity may contribute to the regional hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further studies are recommended to evaluate the natural course of disease versus iatrogenic treatment effects </plain></SENT>
