<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors have studied the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> produced by placement of an epidural balloon (control group) in cats, on cerebral perfusion, evoked responses, and hematological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These elements were measured in similarly injured animals which underwent isovolemic hemodilution with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> 75, after relief of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four hours after balloon deflation, perfusion was markedly impaired in 30% of the control group, and was reduced to 11% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>-infused group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The suppressed N1 amplitude of somatosensory evoked responses on the compression side, the reduced platelet aggregability, and the erythrocyte-deformability by intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly more restored in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>-infused group after decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of platelets with volumes between 21.75 and 48.75 cu mu (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 9.75 to 12.75 cu mu) significantly increased after decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activation of platelets during intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> leads to an increase in platelet volume from platelet aggregation, and correlates with a decrease in platelet aggregability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was also suggested that reduction of erythrocyte deformability was not caused by erythrocyte aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors emphasize the role of intravascular factors such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular obstruction</z:e> by platelet aggregates, and difficulty in passage of erythrocytes through capillaries due to reduced deformability, in the disturbance of the microcirculation following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> 75 by inhibition of platelets as well as hemodilution is stressed </plain></SENT>
