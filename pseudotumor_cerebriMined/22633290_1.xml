<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the magnitude of the association between overweight, moderate, and extreme childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the risk of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Risk estimates were obtained from the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Children's Health Study (n = 913 178) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Weight classes were assigned by body mass index specific for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A combination of electronic database searches followed by complete medical records review was used to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children diagnosed with IIH between 2006 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 78 children with IIH, the majority of whom were girls (n = 66, 84.5%), age 11-19 (n = 66, 84.5%), non-Hispanic Whites (n = 37, 47.4%), and overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (n = 57, 73.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adjusted ORs and 95% CIs of IIH with increasing weight class were 1.00, 3.56 (1.72-7.39), 6.45 (3.10-13.44), and 16.14 (8.18-31.85) for underweight/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (reference category), overweight, moderately <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and extremely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> 11-19 year olds, respectively (P for trend &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other independent IIH risk factors included White non-Hispanic race/ethnicity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups and female sex, but only in older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> children also had more IIH symptoms at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is strongly associated with an increased risk of pediatric IIH in adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic is likely to lead to increased morbidity from IIH particularly among extremely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, White non-Hispanic teenage girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings also suggest careful screening of these at risk individuals may lead to earlier detection and opportunity for treatment of IIH </plain></SENT>
