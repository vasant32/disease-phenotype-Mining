<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SEP, ABR, and ICP were monitored serially and automatically in 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) score was equal to or less than 8 in 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High dose <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi> therapy was performed in 7 cases and intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was removed operatively in 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SEP was recorded from C3'or C4'-Fz leads on the lesion side following stimulation of the contralateral median nerve, and the difference between the two potentials (N20, N13) defined as central conduction time (CCT) was followed at a basic time interval of 10-20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 3 groups according to N20 finding and the prognosis of each group was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final outcome (assessed 6 months after injury) was graded according to Glasgow Outcome Scale as follows: good (good recovery, moderate disability), poor (severe disability, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients with no CCT change showed good recovery (table, 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Out of 7 patients with no N20 on admission, 5 died due to severely increased ICP and the prognosis for the other 2 cases was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The last group consisted of 6 patients in whom CCT varied during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 3 out of these 6 cases N20 finally disappeared due to increased ICP and they died in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
