<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To characterize the clinical course of IIH more completely, we monitored the clinical status, especially visual function, in 50 consecutive newly-diagnosed patients over a period of 2 to 39 months (average follow-up 12.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was 31 (range 11-58) yrs; 46 (92%) were women and 47 (94%) were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (mean weight 90 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Common symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (92%), transient visual obscurations (72%) and intracranial noises (60%); 13 of the patients (26%) initially had complaints of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> as determined by Goldmann perimetry in 96% and by automated perimetry in 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrast sensitivity testing was abnormal in 50% and Snellen acuity in 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients (4%) became blind in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Goldmann visual field grade improved in 60% of patients but visual function deteriorated in 5 (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deterioration of visual field grade was significantly associated only with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> during the year before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>Visual loss</z:hpo> in patients with IIH is common and is often reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients should be evaluated by perimetry using an appropriate strategy and contrast sensitivity testing, along with careful examination of the optic discs </plain></SENT>
