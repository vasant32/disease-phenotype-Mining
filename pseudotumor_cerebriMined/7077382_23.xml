<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ventricular cannulation was used to continuously monitor intracranial pressure (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Actual PVI was measured by bolus injection of fluid and compared with predicted values determined from head circumference and spinal axis length in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 55% of the children, ICP was below 20 mm Hg at initial monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the course of monitoring, 86% of the children had ICP's exceeding 20 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduced PVI (less than 80% of predicted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) proved to be an accurate indicator of impending intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PVI proved to be a useful test for assessing the response to therapies for lowering ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that reduced neural axis compliance accompanies intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> following severe head injury in children, and that treatment of reduced neural axis compliance may prevent refractory intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
