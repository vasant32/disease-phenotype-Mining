<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to review our experience in the diagnosis and management of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, giving special attention to treatments used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective chart review was conducted on 32 patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> between 1984 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects included 23 females and ranged in age from 2 to 17.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was the most common symptom, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>double vision</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> was the most common sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Others were VIth <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo> and compromised visual acuity at or within 3 months of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Management included administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, lumboperitoneal shunt, optic nerve fenestration, and repeat lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment combinations were used in 40% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>decreased visual acuity</z:hpo> persisted for longer than 10 months in a significant number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> causes significant short- and long-term morbidity with no proven effective treatment available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A prospective study is needed to establish the indications for treatment and the efficacy of the treatments used </plain></SENT>
