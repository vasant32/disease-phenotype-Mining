<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to test the efficacy of administration of HS (7.5%) combined with 6% hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> (molecular weight 200,000/0.60-0.66; HHES) for the treatment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> refractory to standard therapy in patients with severe TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee six consecutive patients with severe TBI (GCS &lt; 8) between 22 and 47 years of age (mean 32) who met the inclusion criteria (therapy resistant ICP &gt; 25 mmHg, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) &lt; 60 mmHg, plasma-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> &lt; 150 mOsm and &gt; 4 hours since the last HS/HHES treatment) were prospectively enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received between one and ten bolus infusions of maximal 250 ml HS/HHES at a rate of 20 ml/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 infusions were given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ICP and CPP before treatment were 45 +/- 15 and 52 +/- 18 mmHg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of HS/HHES significantly lowered ICP to 25 +/- 14 mmHg and improved CPP to 72 +/- 16 mmHg at 30 min without affecting arterial blood pressure or blood gases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> normalized within 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HS/HES might become an interesting addition to conventional treatment maneuvers currently used for ICP therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It reduces otherwise therapy-resistant intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> without negatively affecting blood pressure, blood gases and cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
