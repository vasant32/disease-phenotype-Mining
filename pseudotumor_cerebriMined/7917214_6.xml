<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, failing vision, and a diagnosis of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003001'>glomus jugulare tumors</z:hpo> that went undetected for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of intracranial invasion by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> to explain the elevation of intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolization followed by surgical removal of the left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resulted in stabilization of the neurologic condition and preservation of the lower cranial nerves, including intact hearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The likely mechanism of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in this case is an impairment of cerebrospinal fluid absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This unusual presentation should be recognized to avoid delayed diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is not always associated with massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumor</z:e> involvement, as had been previously proposed </plain></SENT>
