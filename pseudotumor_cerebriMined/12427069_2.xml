<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the localization of somatostatin receptor types 1 and 2 in human choroid plexus (CP) and arachnoid granulations (AGs) by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study was performed in an institutional setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed on 15 samples of CP and 12 samples of AGs from 15 patients who died with no signs or symptoms of intracranial disease (age range, 52-81 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CP samples were dissected from the lateral ventricles and AG samples were dissected from the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrated the presence of both somatostatin receptor types 1 and 2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human CP and AGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Analogous to their demonstration and to their function in kidney and ocular tissues, these receptors may be involved in the processes of cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption, and may play a role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Somatostatin analogues have been used to treat idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, a disorder of cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data are scarce regarding the cell-specific distribution of somatostatin receptors in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human CP and AGs, the sites of cerebrospinal fluid production and egress </plain></SENT>
