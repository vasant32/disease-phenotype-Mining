<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Balloon angioplasty and stent placement were performed in 24 IIH cases by lateral sinus stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mechanical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> maceration was performed before stent placing in 5 cases with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical data of clinical presentations, intracranial pressure, pressure of lateral sinus, pressure gradient between distal and proximal lateral sinus stenosis, methods of treatment and therapeutic outcomes were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intracranial pressure dropped from (314 ± 56) mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> of pre-operation to (197 ± 31) mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> of post-operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The post-treatment pressure gradient was obviously high ((159 ± 11) mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>) and a reduction was found ((95 ± 11) mm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> in 16 cases, vision in 13 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in 10 were resolved or improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no other permanent procedure-related morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed up for 2 - 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And no in-stent restenosis occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment is effective for IIH by venous sinus stenosis </plain></SENT>
