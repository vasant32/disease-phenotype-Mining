<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study the integrity of inner and outer <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers in patients with various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> by using high-resolution imaging modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three high-resolution imaging systems constructed at the University of California Davis were used to acquire <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> images from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo>: (1) adaptive optics (AO)-flood-illuminated fundus camera, (2) high-resolution Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (FDOCT), and (3) adaptive optics-Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (AO-FDOCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The AO fundus camera provides en face images of photoreceptors whereas cross-sectional images (B-scans) of the retina are obtained with both FDOCT and AO-FDOCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the volumetric FDOCT data sets, detailed thickness maps of a three-layer complex consisting of the nerve fiber (NF), ganglion cell (GC), and inner plexiform (IP) layers were created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of visible cones in the en face images of photoreceptors was then compared with visual sensitivity maps from Humphrey visual field (HVF; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA) testing, as well as FDOCT and AO-FDOCT images, including the thickness maps of the NF-GC-IP layer complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> were studied: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS), (2) idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>), (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0007634'>nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy</z:hpo> (NAION), (4) optic nerve head <z:hpo ids='HP_0011510'>drusen</z:hpo> with NAION, and (5) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> with MS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With permanent visual field loss and thinning of the NF-GC-IP layer complex, cone photoreceptors showed structural changes, making them less reflective, which caused the appearance of dark spaces in the en face images (hence, reduced number of visible cones) and indistinct outer <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers in OCT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when the visual field loss was only transient, with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NF-GC-IP layer complex, there were no detectable abnormalities in cone photoreceptors (i.e., they were densely packed and had distinct photoreceptor layering in the OCT images) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cone photoreceptors show structural changes when there is permanent damage to overlying inner <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a positive relation between the thickness of the three-layer inner <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> complex, visual sensitivity, and integrity of the cone mosaic </plain></SENT>
