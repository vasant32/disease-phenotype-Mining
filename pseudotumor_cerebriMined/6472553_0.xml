<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ischemic nature of the attacks was substantiated through a simultaneous recording of ICP, systemic arterial blood pressure, and EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Every <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> was clearly accompanied by 1) a typical ICP plateau-wave, 2) a systemic blood pressure wave of lower amplitude, 3) a considerable correlative diminution of the cerebral perfusion pressure and 4) a slowing down of the EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These phenomenons could be provoked by intraventricular injections of a few milliliters of artificial CSF, whereas a ventriculo-peritoneal shunting made them disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role played by the disturbances of the CSF flow in the production of the plateau waves is discussed </plain></SENT>
