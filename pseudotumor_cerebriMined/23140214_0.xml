<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> occurs after dural puncture in about 1%-25% of children who undergo the procedure-a rate similar to that seen in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Persistence of post-dural puncture <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in spite of bed rest, increased fluid intake, and epidural blood patch treatment, however, is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed the medical records and imaging studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients 19 years of age or younger who they evaluated between 2001 and 2010 for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and they identified 8 children who had persistent post-dural puncture <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> despite maximal medical treatment and placement of epidural blood patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A CSF leak could be demonstrated radiologically and treated surgically in 3 of these patients, and the authors report these 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were 2 girls (ages 14 and 16 years) who had undergone lumbar puncture for evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and 1 boy (age 13 years) who had undergone placement of a lumboperitoneal shunt using a Tuohy needle for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The boy also had undergone a laminectomy and exploration of the posterior dural sac, but no CSF leak could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 patients presented with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cases MRI demonstrated a large ventral lumbar or thoracolumbar CSF collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional myelography or digital subtraction myelography revealed a ventral dural defect at L2-3 requiring surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Through a posterior transdural approach, the dural defect was repaired using 6-0 Prolene sutures and a dural substitute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with complete resolution of orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and of the ventral cerebrospinal fluid leak on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that persistent postdural puncture <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> requiring surgical repair is rare in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They note that the CSF leak may be located ventrally and may require conventional or digital subtraction myelography for exact localization and that transdural repair is safe and effective in eliminating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
