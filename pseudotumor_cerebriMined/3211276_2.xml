<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In some cases of dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) of the transverse-sigmoid sinuses, the presence of an occlusion or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> on the sinus contralateral to the affected side may significantly contribute to the development of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For these cases, closure of AV shunts or removal of the affected sinus may not be sufficient to improve intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We encountered 2 cases of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> caused by dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> at the transverse-sigmoid sinuses associated with disturbance of venous outflow contralateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reconstruction of venous outflow using a saphenous vein graft was performed between the transverse sinus and the subclavian or external jugular vein after the dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> were partially occluded by catheter embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was relieved in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one case dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was obstructed by both embolization and radical surgery after the bypass was confirmed unobstructed several weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bypass remained patent at the follow-up 4 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the other case, patency of the bypass lasted only for approximately 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both cases clinical improvements were not remarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is considered that the presence of AV shunt in the case of dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> may facilitate the patency of a graft placed between the venous systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reconstruction of the venous outflow may deserve further trial for the treatment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> associated with some types of dural <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
