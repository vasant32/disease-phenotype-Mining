<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a 45-year-old woman presenting with a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A CSF leak, arising from a posterior ethmoidal left cell, was closed using an underlay procedure with a turbinate composite graft with applied fibrin glue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three months later the CSF rhinorrhoea recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was imputed to morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI 48) responsible for benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent a laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF rhinorrhoea gradually decreased during the 12 months following surgery, in correlation with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, until total resolution was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of a spontaneous CSF leak treated by bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation strengthens the theory that severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> can cause benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> which can lead to CSF leak </plain></SENT>
