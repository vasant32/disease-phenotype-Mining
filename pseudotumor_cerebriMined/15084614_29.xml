<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the results of treatment combining <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) and chemotherapy (CT) in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (APL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children (&lt; 18 years) with newly diagnosed APL were included in the APL93 trial, treated by ATRA followed or combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and then randomly assigned between no maintenance, intermittent ATRA, continuous CT, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 576 patients included in APL93 trial, 31 (5%) were children, including 22 girls (71%) and nine boys (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty of the children (97%) obtained complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATRA syndrome occurred in four children (13%), who <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> achieved CR, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> occurred in 12 children (39%), with signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> in five children (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (23%) relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the eight patients who received both ATRA and CT for maintenance relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> relapsing patients achieved a second CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients remained in first CR after 43+ to 96+ months, six remained in second CR after 17+ to 66+ months, and three patients had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year event-free survival (EFS), relapse, and overall survival rates were 71%, 27%, and 90%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference between adults and children included in the APL93 trial was seen for CR rate, 5-year relapse rate, EFS, and overall survival, but significantly better survival was seen in children after adjustment on WBC counts (P =.02) and incidence of microgranular M3 variant (P =.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ATRA combined with CT for induction and also probably for maintenance provides as favorable results in children with APL as in adults and currently constitutes the reference first-line treatment in both age groups </plain></SENT>
