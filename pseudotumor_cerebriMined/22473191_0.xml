<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was carried out at King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between January 2002 and December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An MRI of the head and orbits was performed for 42 patients with the clinical diagnosis of IIH, and 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> were eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The images were evaluated for the presence of empty sella, parenchymal abnormalities, ventricular and sulcal size changes, optic disc elevation, and optic nerve sheath distention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MRI of the head revealed empty sella in 29 patients and in one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI did not reveal any parenchymal, ventricular or cisternal abnormalities in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Orbital MRI revealed optic nerve sheath distension and optic disc elevation in 36 patients, and were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Brain MRI has limited value in the evaluation of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Orbital MRI is the recommended imaging modality for this entity </plain></SENT>
