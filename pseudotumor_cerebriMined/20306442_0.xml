<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Rarebit perimetry (RBP) is a new perimetric technique that has been reported as a sensitive test for the evaluation of the neural structure of the visual system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare RBP with standard automated perimetry in detecting the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> of patients with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five patients with IIH and 16 healthy controls were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual fields were analyzed with Marco automated static perimeter with threshold and central 30-2 programs (MP 30-2) and rarebit perimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A visual field was classified into 3 zones for both tests as central, paracentral, and peripheral zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean sensitivity (MS) recorded by the MP 30-2 was compared with the mean hit rate (MHR) recorded by RBP for each zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MS recorded by MP 30-2 and MHR recorded by RBP for each zone were significantly lower in the IIH group than in healthy control eyes (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Good correlation was present between the visual fields recorded by both tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the sensitivity and specificity values for each zone were lower in the RBP group than the MP 30-2 group, RBP was found to be efficient to differentiate between the visual fields of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and IIH-affected eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average RBP test duration was significantly shorter than the MP 30-2 test duration (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RBP is a rapid, comfortable, and widely accessible perimetric test giving reliable results in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> in IIH </plain></SENT>
