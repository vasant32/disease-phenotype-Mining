<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate for two years the clinical and tomographic results of the implant of fixed-pressure valves with antisiphon device SPHERA(Â®) in 35 adult patients, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and risk factors for overdrainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 3 had congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in adult patients with very <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>dilated ventricles</z:hpo> (Evans index &gt;50%), 3 had symptomatic overdrainage after previous VS implant (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206620" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hygroma</z:e> or slit ventricle syndrome), 1 had previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo>, 15 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> with final lumbar pressure &lt;5 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> after tap test (40 mL), 6 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, and 7 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> due to other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement was observed and sustained in 94.3% of the patients during the two-year period with no computed tomography (CT) evidence of hypo or overdrainage, and no immediate early or late significant complications </plain></SENT>
