<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Left untreated, this condition can lead to permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous treatment modalities include medical management, therapeutic lumbar puncture and optic nerve sheath fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They have proved to be effective but carry high rates of symptom recurrence or procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal dural venous sinus stenoses have been identified in many patients with IIH, leading to development of treatment through venous sinus angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A review of the literature was performed which identified patients with IIH treated with venous sinus stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedural data and outcomes are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 143 patients with IIH (87% women, mean age 41.4 years, mean body mass index 31.6 kg/m(2)) treated with venous sinus stenting were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptoms at initial presentation included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (90%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (89%), visual changes (62%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> (48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a technical success rate of 99% for the stent placement procedure with a total of nine complications (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At follow-up (mean 22.3 months), 88% of patients experienced improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 97% demonstrated improvement or resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, 87% experienced improvement or resolution of visual symptoms and 93% had resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with IIH with focal venous sinus stenosis, endovascular stent placement across the stenotic sinus region represents an effective treatment strategy with a high technical success rate and decreased rate of complications compared with treatment modalities currently used </plain></SENT>
