<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with recalcitrant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> underwent the insertion of a lumboperitoneal shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The shunt consists of a two-piece Silastic tube and has been used in a population of 150 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, persistent postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002435'>meningocele</z:hpo>, and benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spinal catheter is introduced subcutaneously and no flushing device is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied three groups: 9 patients had a history of head trauma, and 7 of these had undergone one or several ineffective direct approaches to the dural leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients presented with a presumably congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had persistent rhinorrhea due to previous intracranial procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi>-111 cisternography was performed in 10 patients before lumboperitonel (LP) shunting and failed in 2 of those to document the site of leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients showed cessation of rhinorrhea after LP shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 4 of these, shunt-related complications responded to shunt removal with no further recurrence of rhinorrhea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent revision of the shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, the LP shunt failed to control the CSF leak and further intracranial procedures were indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The LP shunt provides an attractive and technically simple solution when direct methods of treatment have failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additionally, LP shunting should be considered as a primary mode of treatment in elderly patients or when impairment of CSF dynamics is documented by radionuclide cisternography and computed tomographic scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When an LP shunt is ineffective, shunt function should be checked by isotopic studies before additional surgery is performed </plain></SENT>
