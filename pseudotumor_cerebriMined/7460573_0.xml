<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were anesthetized (alpha-chloralose), paralyzed (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7907">pancuronium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi>), orotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated to maintain normocapnia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An epidural balloon was incrementally inflated to produce the desired brain tissue pressure (BTP) which was measured by an intracerebral microtransducer implanted contralateral to the balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAP was measured from the carotid artery; cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated as: MAP - BTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During mildly (14 +/- 1 (SE) mm Hg) or moderately (37 +/- 3 mm Hg) increased BTP, SNP infusion increased BTP (17 +/- 1 and 44 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively) (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During severely increased BTP (70 +/- 4 mm Hg), SNP decreased BTP (53 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite this variable BTP, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> consistently decreased during SNP infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BTP and supratentorial subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid pressure correlated closely; however, the supratentorial subarachnoid pressure consistently underestimated BTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that estimation of BTP obtained from subarachnoid screw-type devices may not accurately record the pressure within cerebral tissue and the SBNP should not be administered to patients with known or suspected intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> unless an intracranial (either BTP or subarachnoid) pressure is being monitored </plain></SENT>
