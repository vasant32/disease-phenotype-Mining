<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>Obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) may be associated with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), a disorder most commonly occurring in young <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because polysomnography, the standard test for diagnosing OSA, is expensive and time consuming, questionnaires have been developed to identify persons with OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Berlin questionnaire (BQ) reliably identifies middle-aged and older persons in the community who are at high-risk for OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to validate the BQ as a screening tool for OSA in IIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed IIH completed the BQ and then underwent diagnostic polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BQ was scored as high or low risk for OSA, and the diagnosis of OSA was based on polysomnography findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OSA was defined as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index of â‰¥ 5 on polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients were evaluated (24 women; 15 white and 15 black; age, 16-54 years [median, 32 years]; body mass index, 27.3-51.7 kg/m2 [median, 39.8 kg/m2]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (66.7%) had a high-risk BQ score and 18 (60%) exhibited OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 20 (75%) with a high-risk BQ score had OSA, while 3 of 10 (30%) with a low-risk score had OSA (Fisher test, P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of the BQ for OSA in IIH patients were 83% and 58%, respectively, whereas the positive predictive value was 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A low-risk BQ score identifies IIH patients who are unlikely to have OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Polysomnography should be considered in those with a high-risk score </plain></SENT>
