<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data gathered during the first 24 hours of patient observation are used to predict patient status during the subsequent 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The best predictor out of 10 factors analyzed was the peak ICP level during the first 24 hours (p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other predictors used in the final model were the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (p = 0.045) and abnormal ventricles--defined as ventricles which were either absent, small, or enlarged (p = 0.086) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Error rates of 24% and 20% were obtained initially and by means of a separate cross-validation group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Use of a conservative cut point (25% estimated chance of developing excess ICP) for designating high-risk patients provided a procedure with sensitivity of 86% to 89% for the two groups </plain></SENT>
