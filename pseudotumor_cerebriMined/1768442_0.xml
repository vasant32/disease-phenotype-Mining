<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At admission only 5 patients showed abnormal latencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean of the P100 latencies in patients was significantly increased as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Latencies persisted relatively prolonged once the funduscopy had become <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the last investigation, one year after BIH had disappeared, the latencies in patients were already similar to those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, no patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> latencies had visual sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequelae also did not develop in patients in whom initially prolonged latencies progressively returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> during the evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequelae developed in one patient in whom latencies became progressively prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In that case the increased latencies preceded the fall in visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data may be useful to evaluate visual function in patients with BIH </plain></SENT>
