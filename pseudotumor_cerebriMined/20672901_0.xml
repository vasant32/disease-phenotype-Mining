<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt with the adjustable PS Medical Strata NSC LP valve and small lumen peritoneal catheter was introduced in the authors' unit in 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The object of this study was to audit the unit's experience with this new shunt system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of the clinical records of patients who underwent Strata NSC LP shunt insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical data as well as information about complications and revisions were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between August 2007 and November 2009, 20 patients underwent placement of an LP shunt with an adjustable Strata NSC valve and small lumen peritoneal catheter at the authors' institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 40.3 years and the mean duration of follow-up was 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, 18 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and 15 patients had visual signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 18 patients with preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> did not complain of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> postoperatively, and 4 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> that was found not to be related to shunt function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients with preoperative visual complaints had ongoing visual problems postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The only overdrainage symptoms occurred in association with spontaneous readjustment of the valve and resolved when the valve was reset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (65%) did not require shunt revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (35%) required 13 shunt exploration or revision procedures, mainly due to distal obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Placement of an LP shunt failed to completely resolve the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> problem in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of the Strata NSC valve and small lumen peritoneal catheter is effective in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> and is beneficial in terms of markedly reducing overdrainage complications compared with other reported series of cases in which an LP shunt has been placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the use of the Strata NSC valve and small lumen peritoneal catheter did not have a marked impact on other causes of shunt failure, particularly distal obstruction </plain></SENT>
