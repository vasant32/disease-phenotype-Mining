<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> are known risk factors for idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH; or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors examined profiles of body mass index (BMI) and patterns of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> associated with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They also examined vision-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in newly diagnosed IIH patients and explored the relative contribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> to overall HRQOL in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Matched case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Female patients with newly diagnosed IIH (n = 34) and other neuro-ophthalmologic disorders (n = 41) were enrolled in a case-control study to assess patterns of self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HRQOL was examined using the 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) and the SF-36 Health Survey (Physical Components Summary and Mental Components Summary [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher BMIs were associated with greater risk of IIH (P = .003, logistic regression analysis adjusting for case-control matching), as were higher percentages of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> during the year before symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (5% to 15%) was associated with a greater risk of IIH among both <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and nonobese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> influenced the relation between HRQOL and IIH only for subscale scores reflecting mental health (SF-36 MCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The NEI-VFQ-25 and SF-36 subscale scores were lower in IIH compared with other neuro-ophthalmologic disorders and published norms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and BMI are associated with greater risk of IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even nonobese patients (BMI &lt;30) are at greater risk for IIH in the setting of moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vision-specific and overall HRQOL are affected to a greater extent in IIH than in other neuro-ophthalmologic disorders </plain></SENT>
