<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow and CT density studies suggest that this swelling is due to cerebral hyperemia and increased blood volume, not to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical history, course, and outcome of 63 children with this CT pattern are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen children had a Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score of greater than 8; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> made a complete recovery and follow-up CT scans were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine children had Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores of 8 or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen had a history of a lucid period following the initial unconsciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of these children died of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, the others recovered well with minimal neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four children were rendered immediately and continuously unconscious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a high incidence of second lesions on the CT scan, 50% of this group developed intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and five died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the others were in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> for periods ranging from weeks to months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up CT scans showed an extracerebral collection with a density of cerebrospinal fluid in 27% of the patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> with large sulci in 35%, whereas this pattern was seen only once in those with a lucid period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference between those with and without a lucid period is related to the degree of primary diffuse impact injury to the white matter </plain></SENT>
