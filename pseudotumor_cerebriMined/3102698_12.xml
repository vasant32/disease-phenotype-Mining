<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The first part of this study investigated the combined use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two groups of dogs were studied to determine if renal excretion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> was altered in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in excretion was noted between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen animals were used in other studies to identify the most advantageous sequence of administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infusion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> 15 minutes later resulted in the most profound and sustained ICP reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect on ICP reduction of varying the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> dose was observed in studies using single doses of 0.5 gm/kg, 0.75 gm/kg, and 1 gm/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The larger <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> dose, resulting in a greater blood-brain osmotic gradient, proved to be the most efficacious in ICP reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A further 15 animals were used in investigations to determine whether changing the rate of delivery of the most effective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> dose (1 gm/kg) influenced resultant ICP reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that rapid administration (2 ml/kg/min) produced higher peak serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and more profound lowering of ICP than the same dose delivered at slower rates </plain></SENT>
