<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood pressure was altered by controlled infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">Sodium-nitroprusside</z:chebi> (SNP), <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">Nitroglycerine</z:chebi> (NG) or Trimetaphan (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi>) with the aim of reducing blood pressure by about 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During exflated balloon SNP provoked an increase of ICP which was more prominent than with NG and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During increased ICP (due to inflation of the balloon) again SNP led to a higher further increase of ICP than both NG and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rCBF rose during the state of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ICP when SNP was infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was not observed with infusion of NG or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When ICP was increased again by inflation of the balloon <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 substances reduced rCBF, indicating damage to the autoregulation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 substances should be used with care to reduce blood pressure during surgery or under intensive care condition, particularly in patients with increased ICP </plain></SENT>
