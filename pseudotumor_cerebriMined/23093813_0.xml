<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, some studies have reported an association between idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) and bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (BTSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between BTSS and monosymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, regardless of its clinical characteristics, in subjects without clinical evidence of IH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected 78 subjects (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women, mean age 49.5 Â± 10.36) affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, without clinical history of audiological and otological pathologies, enrolled among outpatients of the Institute of Audiology and Phoniatrics in Catanzaro, Italy, over a 2 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent psychometric evaluation, psychoacoustic assessment, neurological and ophthalmological examination, cerebral magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRV identified BTSS in 17.9% (14 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the BTSS group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> was bilateral/central in 21%, and monolateral in the remaining patients (50% left; 29% right ear) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was more frequently pulsating in the BTSS group, but 64.9% of BTSS subjects described their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> as stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> showed statistical significance in association with BTSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In BTSS subjects, we found values suggesting IH by lumbar puncture (LP) in 40% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In these patients, LP gave immediate improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association between BTSS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, regardless of its features, must be considered when other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> are excluded </plain></SENT>
