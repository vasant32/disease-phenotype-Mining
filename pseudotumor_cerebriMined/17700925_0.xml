<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study the effects of octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, in patients with Idiopathic Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a prospective, open-label study of the effect of Octreotide on 26 patients with symptoms and signs of IIH, investigated by brain MRI and lumbar puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Octreotide was administered subcutaneously, at an initial dose of 0.3 mg/day; and was gradually increased until <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was relieved (upper-dose limit: 1 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with octreotide at 1 mg/day was administered for a maximum of six to eight months and afterwards the dose was gradually tapered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed prospectively every month for three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF opening pressure was measured before the treatment was started and again in the first follow-up examination, on month one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follow-up visits the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> was evaluated by fundoscopy; visual fields and visual acuity were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall 24/26 patients improved significantly (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was relieved within days (1-10, median 7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> subsided in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 24 patients, in up to two months (35 to 68, median 45 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Visual disturbances, initially presenting in 20 of our patients, improved in 18 (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean reduction in CSF pressure after treatment was 20.72A+/-10.7 cmH2O (range 2 to 48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for three years after cessation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, or any other symptoms, has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Octreotide resulted in a significant and sustained improvement of IIH in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that it may be an effective alternative to existing treatments for IIH </plain></SENT>
