<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She was also receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Withdrawal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> and continuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> did not result in any improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> resulted in improvement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> may be a side effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> in some adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, we hypothesized that extended treatment over several years, young age, and a compromised central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system due to underlying disorders may be risk factors for the development of this side effect </plain></SENT>
