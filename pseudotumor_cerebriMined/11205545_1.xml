<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with these shunts and clarify concepts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have implanted 125 Codman-Medos programmable devices in 118 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequent indication was secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, particularly due to obstruction by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were also used in cases of benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, CSF <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cysts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most valves were inserted frontally, under antibiotic prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Excluding patients with a follow-up of less than three months, the average follow-up was 14.63 +/- 9.07 months, with clinical improvement in 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was 0% mortality in relation to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The initial average pressure was 121.84 +/- 24.74 mmH2O and after 52 reprogrammings done in 36 (30%) of the patients, the final average pressure was 124.96 +/- 30.58 mmH2O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reprogramming was done for the management of symptoms and to avoid subdural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206620" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hygromas</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We have observed no clinical signs of unprogramming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 29 complications which were treated by reprogramming in 7 cases and surgically in the remainder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We recommend frontal insertion, with a long peritoneal catheter, mainly in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> secondary to stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius, benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, after head injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold-Chiari malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The initial pressure is difficult to determine but tends to be average or high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reprogramming is particularly useful in the treatment of subdural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206620" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hygromas</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We have observed no clinical signs of unprogramming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Complications tend to be due to surgical technique rather than the particular shunt used </plain></SENT>
