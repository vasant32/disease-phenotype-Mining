<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This test, which determlnes the increase in intracranial pressure induced by an addition of 1 ml in ventricular CSF volume in 1 sencond, yields information concerning spatial compensation in patients with intracranial space-occupying processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of variability tests, a change in volume-pressure response of 2 mm Hg/ml was accepted as significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pronounced enlargement of the ventricles interferes with the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, intravenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (0.5gm/kg) and intramuscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3077">betamethasone</z:chebi> (26 mg) both reduce the volume-pressure response significantly more than they reduce intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that these agents favorably alter the configuration of the volume-pressure curve </plain></SENT>
