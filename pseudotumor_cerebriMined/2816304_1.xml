<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) with various degrees of increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) on the staining of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F2-alpha (PG F2alpha) were studied in rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SAH was produced in 18 rats by injection of 0.18-0.20 ml of autologous arterial blood/100 g body weight into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By changing the speed of injection, the ICP was transiently increased by 346 +/- 68 (mean +/- S.D.) mm Hg in eight rats (including three pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>), by 200 +/- 42 mm Hg in five rats, and by 6 +/- 4 mm Hg in the other five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three rats injected with the same volume of mock cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with ICP increased by 217 +/- 67 mm Hg and five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats without injection served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were decapitated 15 min after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cryosections were stained for PG F2 alpha using an indirect immunofluorescence method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive staining for PG F2 alpha was noted only in pial vessels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mock-CSF-injected rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SAH rats with ICP increased by 6 +/- 4 mm Hg, there was a positive reaction in hippocampal neurons and Purkinje cells as well as blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SAH rats with higher ICP showed stronger PG F2 alpha staining in the above areas, as well as in cerebellar granule cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> showed a smaller increase in staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The above results indicate that subarachnoid blood clots per se produce a rapid increase of PG F2 alpha in neurons and blood vessels of both cerebrum and cerebellum, and that this increase is augmented by intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
