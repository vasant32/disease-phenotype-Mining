<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-like compounds (OLC) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the occurence of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: OLC are naturally occurring inhibitors of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> ATPase that are found in the CSF of mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the production of CSF is dependent upon <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> ATPase activity, and since there is evidence that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> found in the condition of IIH may be the result of increased CSF production, we hypothesized that the level of endogenous OLC would be reduced in the CSF of patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CSF samples were obtained from n = 7 patients with IIH and n = 31 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> other than IIH ("control" patients) who had lumbar puncture as part of their routine evaluation or treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentration of OLC in the CSF samples was measured using an established ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with IIH exhibited a concentration of OLC in the CSF of 0.11 +/- 0.03 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the concentration of OLC in CSF samples from non-IIH control patients was 0.12 +/- 0.01 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These values were not statistically different when compared with a t-test (P= 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the concentration of OLC did negatively correlate to the opening pressure on lumbar puncture, but only in the IIH group (r=-0.80, P= .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IIH patients who were newly diagnosed or who were unsuccessfully treated (n = 5 of 7 IIH patients) exhibited OLC concentrations of 0.06 +/- 0.1 ng/mL, which is nearly lower than that of the control group (P= .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The average concentration of OLC in IIH patients (treated and untreated) is unlikely to be distinguishable from that in non-IIH control patients with other neurological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the concentration of OLC may be inversely related to the intracranial pressure in patients with IIH, and it may prove to be lower in the subgroup of untreated and unsuccessfully treated IIH patients </plain></SENT>
