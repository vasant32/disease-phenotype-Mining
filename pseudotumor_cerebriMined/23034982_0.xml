<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study sought to characterize the optic disc <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, particularly the cup-to-disc ratio of the optic nerve head in children with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The medical charts and digital optic disc photos of children with confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optic disc area, cup area, and cup-to-disc ratio were measured digitally using VISUPAC software, and the mean values of those parameters were compared to the published norms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of children with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 83% had absence of the physiological cup of the optic disc, compared to 10% of children in the general population of the same age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median disc area was 2.2 mm(2), and median cup area was 0.0mm(2), compared to the published norms of 2.69 mm(2) and 0.44 mm(2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is very significantly high prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0006217'>small optic disc</z:mp> cups in children with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, with the cup being absent on majority of cases in our patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may signal an underlying systemic predisposition to the development of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
