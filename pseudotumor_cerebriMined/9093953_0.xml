<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the records of 1,113 patients affected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> (ON), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339143" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' ophthalmopathy</z:e> with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo>, or idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> (IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred six records of patients showed that an FM-100 had been performed (23 ON, 46 Graves', 37 IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty additional patients were studied prospectively (11 ON, 17 Graves', 12 IIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible 21 chip subtests were compared against the same statistics for the entire test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that for these three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">optic nerve disorders</z:e>, a test consisting of chips 22-42 had nearly the same sensitivity and specificity as the entire test when compared with the clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 90% specificity, the ratio of sensitivities of the short version to the original version of the test were IIH, 53%/45%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo>, 85%/79%; and Graves', 67%/70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the clinical value of the test can be achieved in one fourth of the original examination time </plain></SENT>
