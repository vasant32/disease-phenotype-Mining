<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report their experience concerning 75 cases of middle fossa <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cysts</z:hpo> observed in children during the period 1975-1993, 47 of which (62.6%) were operated upon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to study the clinical presentation of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath>, to discuss the surgical indications and to compare the results of the various techniques used to treat these malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Head injury was revealing in 17 cases (22.6%) and among these, 12 patients presented intracranial complications (subdural effusions; 6 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematomas</z:hpo>: 4 cases and intracystic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp>: 2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most usual signs and symptoms were: intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (25.3%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (16%) and temporal bulging (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (44.7%) underwent a cystoperitoneal shunt; 20 patients (42.5%) were treated by membranectomy with opening of the basal cisterns and removal of intracystic (2 cases) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> (4 cases); 2 patients (4.3%) were treated using membranectomy, opening of the cisterns and cystoperitoneal shunt and 4 patients (8.4%) underwent a subduroperitoneal shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The long-term results were good regardless of the surgical procedure; nevertheless, only one patient among 20 cases treated by membranectomy and opening of the cisterns developped complications (5%), while multiple shunt revisions were necessary in 11 children (40.7%) out of 27 where a shunt was inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that membranectomy and opening of the basal cisterns is the procedure of choice to treat middle fossa <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cysts</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
