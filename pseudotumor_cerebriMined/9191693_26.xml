<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, invasive intensive care unit monitoring of cerebral oxygenation has become feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of standard therapeutic interventions used in the treatment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on cerebral oxygenation and other physiologic parameters in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the neurosurgical intensive care unit, Ptio2, and jugular bulb oxygen saturation (Sjvo2), arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were prospectively studied (0.1 Hz acquisition rate) with a multimodal monitoring system in 21 patients with severe traumatic brain injury during various treatment modalities: <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> infusion, head positioning, and induced arterial <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For baseline CPP values below 40 mm Hg, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> infusion was more effective in decreasing ICP and improving Ptio2 and Sjvo2 than for initial CPP values above 60 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, although improving CPP and lowering ICP, did not affect Ptio2 and Sjvo2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CPP in this group, however, was always above 60 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> to an end-tidal Pco2 of 21 mm Hg normalized ICP and CPP, but significantly reduced cerebral oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A CPP &gt; 60 mm Hg emerges as the crucial factor guaranteeing sufficient brain oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Any intervention used to further elevate CPP does not improve cerebral oxygenation, to the contrary, forced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> even bears the risk of inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
