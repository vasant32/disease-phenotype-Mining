<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Transverse sinus stenosis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e>) is common in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH), but its effect on the course and outcome of IIH is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> characteristics between patients with IIH with "good" vs "poor" clinical courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with IIH seen in our institution after September 2009 who underwent a high-quality standardized brain magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized as having a good or poor clinical course based on medical record review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The location and percent of each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> were determined for each patient, and were correlated to the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 51 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients had bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median average percent stenosis was 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one percent of patients had stenoses &gt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five of the 51 patients (69%) had no final visual field loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (16%) had a clinical course classified as poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the average percent stenosis between those with good clinical courses vs those with poor courses (62% vs 56%, p = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the percent stenosis based on the visual field grade (p = 0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CSF opening pressure was not associated with either location or degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> is common, if not universal, among patients with IIH, and is almost always bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There is no correlation between the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> and the clinical course, including visual field loss, among patients with IIH, suggesting that clinical features, not the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e>, should be used to determine management in IIH </plain></SENT>
