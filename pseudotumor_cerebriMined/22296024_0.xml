<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inaccessibility of human brain tissue can be partially solved by using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a tool for assessing the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system's production of orexigen and anorexigen factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using proteomic analysis, the present study investigated the differentially displayed proteins in human CSF from <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We designed a case-control study conducted in a reference hospital where eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (cases) and eight non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (controls) women with idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was normalised through the placement of a ventriculo- or lumboperitoneal shunt in the 12 months before their inclusion in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isotope-coded protein label (for proteins &gt; 10 kDa) and label-free liquid chromatography (for proteins &lt; 10 kDa) associated with mass spectrometry analysis were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen differentially expressed proteins were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many of them fall into three main groups: <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (osteopontin, fibrinogen γ and β chain, α1 acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 2 and haptoglobin), neuroendocrine mediators (neurosecretory protein VGF, neuroendocrine protein 7B2, chromogranin-A and chromogranin B), and brain plasticity (testican-1, isoform 10 of fibronectin, galectin-3 binding protein and metalloproteinase inhibitor type 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differential production of osteopontin, neurosecretory protein VGF, chromogranin-A and fibrinogen γ chain was further confirmed by either enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have identified potential candidates that could be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies aiming to investigating the precise role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and their potential therapeutic implications are needed </plain></SENT>
