<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of an externally applied negative abdominal pressure device designed to lower the effects of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> in severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Short-term clinical intervention trial in the Clinical Research Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Days 1 and 3 were 'control' days; on days 2 and 4-6 patients were in the device from 8:00 am to noon and from 1:00 to 5:00 pm, and on nights 7-11 they were in the device from 10:00 pm to 8:00 am </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The last four patients were treated in a device with a counter-traction mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Seven centrally <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women with PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> severity were graded by the patient using visual analog scale (1-10) and averaged for the time that the device was in use or not in use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IAP was estimated from urinary bladder pressure (UBP) before and during device use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The internal jugular vein (IJV) elliptical cross-sectional area was measured with B-mode ultrasonography; the timed average velocity was measured by Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a decrease in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (6.8+/-0.8 to 4.2+/-0.8, P&lt;0.05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> (4.2+/-0.5 to 1.8+/-0.5, P&lt;0.02) within 5 min, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (to 2.2+/-0.8, P&lt;0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> (to 1.7+/-0.5, P&lt;0.01) within 1 h of device activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>UBP decreased (P&lt;0.001) from 19.1+/-3 to 12.5+/-2.8 cmH2O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> remained improved throughout time that the device was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the second week, five of seven patients slept in the device without difficulty and four awoke without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a progressive decrease (P&lt;0.01) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> during the day after sleeping in the device at night as compared with days 1 and 3 when it was not used (6.5+/-0.5, day 1; 4.1+/-0.7, day 3; 3.1+/-0.8, day 8; 2.3+/-0.8, day 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headaches</z:hpo> returned late in the afternoon in two patients; the device was reactivated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> again improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent IJV sonography; the IJV area decreased (129+/-53 to 100+/-44 mm2, P=0.06) without a change in IJV flow (1004+/-802 to 1000+/-589 ml/min) with the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>When activated, the device was pulled into the patient, creating discomfort that was alleviated with the counter-traction mechanism in the last four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a 5 cm area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008066'>blisters</z:hpo> that resolved when the device was worn over a hospital gown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing IAP relieved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> in PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>When patients slept in the device, they awoke without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, which remained markedly improved throughout most of the following day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This study supports the hypothesis that PTC in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women is secondary to an increased IAP </plain></SENT>
