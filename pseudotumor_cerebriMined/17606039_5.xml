<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study presents a literature review and 2 case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The medical records of 2 patients who had nontraumatic CSF rhinorrhea were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were diagnosed as having spontaneous, nontraumatic CSF rhinorrhea, believed to have been caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, and were surgically treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients are <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, middle-aged women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea</z:e> is most often the result of trauma, but it may also occur spontaneously because of nontraumatic causes in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> can be an overlooked cause of spontaneous, nontraumatic CSF rhinorrhea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A patient with signs and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> should be evaluated and treated, if the condition is present, to prevent complications that include irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and CSF rhinorrhea </plain></SENT>
