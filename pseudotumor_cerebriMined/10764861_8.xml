<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether a relationship exists between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> and the presence of idiopathic choroidal folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study in which 12 consecutive patients presenting with choroidal folds were evaluated by imaging studies (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or computed tomography) to rule out known causes of choroidal folds, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029182" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">orbital disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008523" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">choroidal tumor</z:e>, posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0100532'>scleritis</z:hpo>, hypotony, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1282209" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">choroidal neovascular membrane</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A lumbar puncture was performed on each of these patients, and measurement of opening pressure of cerebrospinal fluid was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients with choroidal folds included nine men and three women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients (50%) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> in the eye with choroidal folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other six patients (50%) presented with only choroidal folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, 10 (83%) of 12 patients had an opening pressure greater than 230 mm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients presenting with only choroidal folds, five (83%) of six patients had an opening pressure greater than 230 mm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>, with an average opening pressure of 290 mm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Depending on the timing of the evaluation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> may or may not be present, and only choroidal folds may be seen as a reflection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> from any source (that is, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial mass</z:e>) can present with only choroidal folds; therefore, these patients should have an appropriate work-up that should probably include a lumbar puncture before the title of "idiopathic" is given to their finding </plain></SENT>
