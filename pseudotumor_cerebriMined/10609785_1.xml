<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study combining IFN-alpha, low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (ara-C) and ATRA was to increase the proportion of patients achieving a major cytogenetic response, in comparison with a group of 140 patients previously treated with IFN-alpha plus low-dose ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty three patients with Ph-positive <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase were treated with IFN-alpha 5 MU/m2 s.c. daily, low-dose ara-C 10 mg s.c. daily and ATRA 45 mg/m2 orally daily, for 7 consecutive days every other week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 76% of patients achieved a complete hematologic response (CHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cytogenetic response was in observed 59% (major in 38% and complete in 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients treated with IFN-alpha and low-dose ara-C, those receiving additional ATRA had a lower CHR rate (p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>014), but other response rates were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe toxicities were common with the triple regimen (64%), mostly related to ATRA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>; two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> during the week on ATRA treatment, decreasing during the week off (one suffered a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>-like reaction followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo>, resembling ATRA syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients had other unusual side-effects: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>aseptic necrosis</z:hpo> of the hip (1 patient), ataxic syndrome (1 patient), paranoid syndrome (2 patients), syncopal episodes (1 patient), pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion the results of IFN-alpha and low-dose ara-C combined with ATRA in patients with early <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase were disappointing, due to excessive toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether different ATRA dose schedules may result in fewer side-effects and improve hematologic and cytogenetic response remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
