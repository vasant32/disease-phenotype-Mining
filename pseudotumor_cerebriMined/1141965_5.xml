<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors studied the effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> withdrawal of steroids in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CSF absorption was measured by determining the amount of isotope (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi> 111DTPA) recovered over a 4-hour period after injection into the cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resistance to CSF absorption was estimated by determining rates of low of Ringer's <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> infusion into the cisterna magna over a range of pressure gradients between CSF and sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Steroid withdrawal was associated with a marked reduction in CSF absorption and an increase in resistance to CSF flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dogs on steroids also showed reduced CSF absorption although the reduction was not statistically significant when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms of action of steroids on CSF absorption, the etiology of the benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome and the use of steroids and in the control of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
