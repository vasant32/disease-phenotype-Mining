<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We found that under conditions of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> production, the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> resolution by the CSF is not appreciably enhanced with lowering of the ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the entrance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> fluid into CSF for the high-pressure series was notably slower, the amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> remaining in the brain was not appreciably affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This appears somewhat contradictory to the principle that increasing the bulk flow pressure gradient should increase flow into the CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, simultaneous steady-state measurements of the change in brain tissue pressure for a corresponding change in CSF pressure showed that the two pressures are identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, when ICP is lowered, the brain tissue pressure follows with no gradient increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This also suggests that lowering of ICP and the concomitant reduction of tissue pressure may increase the intravascular tissue pressure gradient, which may act to increase the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More work is required to resolve this issue </plain></SENT>
