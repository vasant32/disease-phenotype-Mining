<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PTC patients who underwent continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in our unit were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six ICP monitoring procedures were done on 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pressure, 2 overdrainage/low pressure, 11 underdrainage/high pressure and 2 variable pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results 12 patients were managed conservatively: 11 patients were referred to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> team and 1 patient had readjustment of an adjustable valve shunt setting; of those 3 patients had improved symptoms on their first post-operative clinic review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 14 patients had surgery: 5 had shunt revision and 9 had shunt insertion; of those 5 patients improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ICP monitoring using an intraparenchymal probe is a safe and effective diagnostic technique in investigating PTC when indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multidisciplinary approach achieves best results in terms of successful management and follow-up </plain></SENT>
