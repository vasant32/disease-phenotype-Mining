<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors have investigated the relationships between the amplitude of the ICP pulse wave, the mean values of ICP and CPP, and the outcome of 56 head injured ventilated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ICP was monitored continuously using a Camino transducer (35 patients) or subdural catheter (21 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Score was 6 (range 3-13; 5 patients had a GCS &gt; 8 after resuscitation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped according to their Glasgow Outcome Score assessed at 12 months after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amplitude of ICP pulse waveform was assessed using the fundamental harmonic of the pulse waveform (<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>) to avoid distortion caused by different frequency responses of the pressure transducers used in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis revealed that in patients with fatal outcome the ICP pulse amplitude increased when the mean ICP increased to 25 mmHg and then began to decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The upper breakpoint of the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-ICP relationship was not present in patients with good/moderate outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The moving correlation coefficient between the fundamental harmonic of ICP pulse wave and the mean ICP (RAP: R-symbol of correlation between A-amplitude and P-pressure) was introduced to describe the time-dependent changes in correlation between amplitude and mean ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RAP was significantly lower in patients who died or remained in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 7 patients who died from uncontrollable intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> RAP was oscillating or decreased to 0 or negative values well before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270679" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain-stem herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination of an ICP above 20 mmHg for a period longer than 6 hours with low correlation between the amplitude and pressure (RAP &lt; 0.5) was described as an predictive index of an unfavourable outcome </plain></SENT>
