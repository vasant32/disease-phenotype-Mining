<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases examined the diameter was always increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperative checks revealed a decrease of the nerve thickness until it reached the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The changes in the optic nerve diameter reflect the variations of the intracranial pressure and they appear earlier than any changes in the fundus oculi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This simple and non-invasive echographic technique is very useful in following patients with an intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
