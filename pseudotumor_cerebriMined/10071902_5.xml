<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present 6 cases to better delineate the problem, the patient profile, the response to treatment, and the sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients admitted with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> who had documented usage of a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-class drug immediately before presentation at the Hospital For Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, from January 1, 1986, to March 1, 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients (5 female, 1 male) who met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified; their ages ranged from 12 to 17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were being treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> vulgaris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Duration of use before diagnosis was as short as 2 weeks and as long as 10 months, with a mean of 4.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duration of symptoms ranged from 0.57 to 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (6 of 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (5 of 6), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> (4 of 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> for whom height and weight data were known (5 of 6) were in the upper quartile for body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity was 6/6 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 eye of one patient (6/9) at diagnosis, and final visual acuity was 6/6 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> color vision, where this was recorded (5 of 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The only recorded field defect was enlargement of the blind spot (4 of 6) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> as a result of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-class drugs does occur in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With prompt and appropriate medical treatment, long-term sequelae can almost always be avoided </plain></SENT>
