<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lesions were seen to best advantage on T2-weighted imaging and were not visible on computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that such occipital lobe MRI lesions likely reflect extravasation of fluid and proteins across the blood brain barrier, damaged as a consequence of cerebral autoregulation failure </plain></SENT>
