<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The peak values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3647">CPZ</z:chebi> in serum came up immediately after its rapid intravenous administration and then decreased exponentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3647">CPZ</z:chebi> in CSF started to increase with a long delay of about 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average peak level in CSF remained 21.6 micrograms/ml and corresponded to 10.3% of the peak level in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The best transfer of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> into CSF has been reported, while that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3647">CPZ</z:chebi> would be one of the next </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3647">CPZ</z:chebi> levels in CSF showed a slower decay than in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3647">CPZ</z:chebi> in brain reached the peak level in less than 30 min and the average peak level was 36.5 micrograms/g cerebral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brain to blood rate of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3647">CPZ</z:chebi> concentration was 11.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3647">CPZ</z:chebi> levels in the brain showed a rapid decrease like the transition of antibiotic levels in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The antibiotic levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The one showed sharp peak about one tenth of the values in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The other was of a slowly increasing type </plain></SENT>
