<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Narrowing of the cranial dural venous sinuses has been implicated as contributing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> in idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> [IIH] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such narrowing may be either a fixed stenosis or secondary to raised ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated whether narrowing of the venous sinuses may reflect direct coupling between cerebrospinal fluid pressure and sagittal sinus pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with the clinical features of IIH [8F, 1M; mean age 41 (range 22-55)] were studied as part of their standard clinical investigations by simultaneous lumbar CSF infusion study and direct retrograde cerebral venography whereby a catheter is placed within the sagittal sinus under fluoroscopic guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, both CSF pressure (Pcsf) and sagittal sinus pressure (Pss) were elevated with Pcsf slightly exceeding Pss (27.0 +/- 2.3 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>25.2 +/- 7.5 mm Hg; difference P = 0.026; correlation R = 0.97, P = 0.0032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a gradient of pressure along the sagittal and transverse sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CSF infusion provoked rises in both Pcsf and Pss (R = 0.97, P &lt; 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During drainage of CSF after the test (8 cases), Pcsf decreased to values lower than Pss (-3.26 +/- 3.9 mm Hg; P = 0.0097) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was excellent correlation between slow waves of Pcsf and Pss (mean R = 0.9) and between baseline pulse amplitudes of both pressures (R = 0.91; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the 9 patients studied with IIH, Pcsf and Pss were coupled both statically (mean values) and dynamically (vasogenic components) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During drainage, both pressures decreased until probably central venous pressure was reached and then Pcsf decreased further while Pss remained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that, in many cases of IIH, there is functional obstruction of venous outflow through the dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Raised Pcsf partly obstructs venous sinus outflow, thereby increasing Pss which, in turn, leads to a further rise in Pcsf, et sequor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This vicious cycle can be interrupted by draining CSF </plain></SENT>
