<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The inability of volitional unilateral eyelid closure is an uncommon symptom of a central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When it occurs as the result of a localized brain lesion, it is debated to be a form of supranuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo> or an apraxic phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To report and discuss a unilateral (left-sided) higher-order <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorder</z:hpo> of the facial periocular musculature bearing apraxic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University neurology department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: A 78-year-old right-handed man was admitted to the hospital with a left-sided brachiofacial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After thrombolysis with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, including the left-sided facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial computed tomographic scans showed that the patient was left with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the right anterior cerebral artery territory, affecting the frontal commissural fibers of the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no signs of upper motor neuron facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> on the left side when gesturing in a natural context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eyelid closure was complete during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, left eyelid closure and elevation of the left eyebrow were not possible on verbal command </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, voluntary innervation of the perioral facial musculature was performed properly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The voluntary-automatic dissociation of our patient's eyelid closure was suggestive of an apraxic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Disconnection from a praxis center caused by callosal damage may be assumed to be the underlying cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The unilaterality of the symptom might imply that in a bilaterally organized corticonuclear system such as upper face innervation, it is the crossing fibers that are primarily involved in praxis tasks </plain></SENT>
