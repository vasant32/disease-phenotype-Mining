<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three aphasic patients with infarctions involving the left anterior cerebral artery have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two had trancortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002427'>motor aphasia</z:hpo>, and one had mixed transcortical (or isolation) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on computerized tomography in two patients and whole-brain sections in one, the patient with mixed transcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> had a lesion that went beyond the rolandic fissure to involve the anterior precuneus lobule of the left medial parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients with transcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002427'>motor aphasia</z:hpo>, the lesion was confined to the frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From these cases and other data, it seems likely that the left medial parietal lobe has receptive language functions analogous to the motor language functions of the left medial frontal lobe, thus accounting for the mixed transcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> observed in the patient whose left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior cerebral artery infarction</z:e> involved both the medial parietal and medial frontal lobes </plain></SENT>
