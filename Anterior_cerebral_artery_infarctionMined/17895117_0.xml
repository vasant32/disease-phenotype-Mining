<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the topographical distribution of the lesions and the resulting clinical effects for a better understanding of their relationship and the functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 17 patients; the mean age of the cohort was 71 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 10 men and 7 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two clinical syndromes were identified in accordance to the two anatomic areas of distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The paracentral lobule syndrome (group 1) was characterized by contralateral motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, the leg more than the arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second group involved mainly the motor and supplementary motor areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beside contralateral <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, they had a clinical picture of extrapyramidal symptomatology, which was designated as pseudoparkinsonian syndrome (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of the patients in group 2 had bilateral occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> compared with 14% in the group 1, and it is likely that the mechanism was artery-to-artery embolism or cardioembolism in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group 1, the lesions were smaller but superficial and it is possible that small emboli from the heart or parent large artery caused the obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The location of the occlusion may be indicative of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pseudoparkinsonian group with extrapyramidal features attributable to involvement of the supplementary motor area had an unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was poor correlation between size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and functional outcome (P=.12) in both groups </plain></SENT>
