<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 with left hemispheric lesion showed right hand's impulsive reaching and grasping and left hand's antagonistic movements to the right (intermanual conflict; IMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients 2 and 3 with right hemispheric lesion manifested a left hemihypokinesia which was thought to have suppressed the frequency and amplitude or even the occurrence of left hand's reaching and grasping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IMC and other left hand's non-antagonistic, irrelevant movements to the right remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because the term "IMC" is often misused and not strictly defined, its association with right hand's reaching and grasping is quite uncommon, its significance as a sign of callosal disconnection is not well validated, and because left hand's reaching and grasping tend to be suppressed by motor neglect, a trend may then develop for the right hand to be the sole focus of pathological behaviour in patients with the so-called frontal AHS (Feinberg, Schindler, Flanagan et al., 1992) </plain></SENT>
