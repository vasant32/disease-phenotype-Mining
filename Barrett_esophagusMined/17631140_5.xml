<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> generates N-nitrosative stress on reacting with oxygen at neutral pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to ascertain if <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> exerts nitrosative stress in the human upper gastrointestinal tract, and to assess the influence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> on this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tube, segmented every 15 mm and containing phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32863">secondary amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34856">morpholine</z:chebi>, was inserted into the upper gastrointestinal tract of 16 healthy volunteers and 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The tube wall has the same permeability properties as an epithelial <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> membrane, allowing passage of gases such as nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, but not hydrogen ions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 2 hours, the tube was removed and the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and N-nitrosomorpholine in each segment were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Healthy volunteers were studied with and without ingestion of (15)N-enriched nitrate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients were studied with and without stimulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In healthy volunteers, N-nitrosomorpholine was generated in the tube sections exposed to gastric acid and increased 2-fold after nitrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The N-nitrosomorpholine was 77% enriched with (15)N, confirming its source was the ingested nitrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the Barrett's patients, generation of N-nitrosomorpholine was shifted proximally with 80% of nitrosative stress occurring within the esophagus during periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the in situ formation of N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35803">nitrosamine</z:chebi> from dietary nitrate via nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, nitrosative stress occurs almost entirely within the esophagus and may contribute toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> at this site </plain></SENT>
