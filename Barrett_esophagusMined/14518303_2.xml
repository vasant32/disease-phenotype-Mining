<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples were obtained by endoscopic biopsy or after surgery in 43 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA analysis was performed with PCR SSCP and DNA sequencing of the mutation cluster region (Exon 15) of the APC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our analysis demonstrated an infrequent occurrence of APC gene mutations in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (n = 3) and dysplastic Barrett's mucosa (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the functional significance of the frequently observed APC allelic losses (LOH) must be questioned, as a single allelic loss is not sufficient for a complete gene inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It might however be, that a target gene responsible for the molecular pathogenesis of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is located outside the APC region on chromosome 5q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>5q allelic losses could however, serve as a marker for the malignant potential of Barrett's epithelium, as they occur with a high frequency in an early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
