<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent technological advances have allowed superficially spreading intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus to be successfully resected by circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection (cESD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After this procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> develop in most patients and are mainly treated by endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare oral steroids plus EBD with EBD alone for the management of benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> after cESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary-care referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We studied 23 consecutive patients who underwent complete cESD for superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> (22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> and 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: After cESD, patients were managed with EBD alone (EBD, n = 13) or with EBD and oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (steroid + EBD, n = 10), 30 mg daily, started 2 days after cESD and gradually tapered and discontinued after 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Total number of EBD sessions and total EBD period (months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Steroid + EBD patients required fewer sessions (13.8 ± 6.9 vs 33.5 ± 22.9; P &lt; .001) and a shorter management period (4.8 ± 2.3 vs 14.2 ± 17.5 months, P = .005) compared with the EBD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An additional 3 patients received oral steroids a mean interval of 158 days after cESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patients required more EBD sessions (46.3 ± 30.0; P = .002), and the EBD period was significantly longer (17.5 ± 13.0 months; P = .005) than in the early steroid + EBD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Nonrandomized study; retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After cESD, oral steroid therapy dramatically reduced the need for EBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that oral steroid therapy after EBD is an effective strategy for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> after complete cESD </plain></SENT>
