<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a controlled prospective study investigating the risk of colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six additional patients with previous colonoscopy were considered separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in these patients was compared with that in a group of 25 asymptomatic subjects participating in a screening colonoscopy study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (17.6%) in the Barrett's group and 11 (44%) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Including the six Barrett's patients with previous colonoscopy, the rate was 30.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were found in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the rate of colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> is no higher in a group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> than in a group of matched asymptomatic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> does not justify a special colonoscopic surveillance program </plain></SENT>
