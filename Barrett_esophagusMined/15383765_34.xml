<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: More than half the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) show no endoscopic abnormality or minimal change <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (non-erosive reflux disease, NERD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the value of endoscopic and histological markers for the prediction of NERD before and after treatment with 20 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between July and October 2002, consecutive patients presenting for upper endoscopy were stratified into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and non-reflux patients (control group) with the help of a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The endoscopist was blind to the presence of reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using magnifying endoscopes minimal change <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was defined by the presence of vascular injection or vascular spots above the Z-line, villous mucosal surface and islands of squamous cell epithelium below the Z-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Targeted and random biopsies were taken below and above the Z-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with endoscopically visible classical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (Los Angeles A-D) or histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were not further investigated in the study (drop out) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The esophageal specimens were histologically evaluated for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>, infiltration with leukocytes, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of basal cells and length of papillae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with NERD were treated with 20 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi>/day for 4 weeks and reevaluated by endoscopy as described before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 39 patients with heartburn and 39 patients without reflux symptoms (controls) were finally included in the analysis (per protocol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with NERD significantly (p = 0.005) more often showed endoscopic signs of minimal change <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (27/39) than the control group (8/39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An <z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>increased length</z:mp> of papillae (14/39 versus 2/39; p = 0.005) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_152'>basal cell hyperplasia</z:mpath> (17/39 versus 4/39; p = 0.009) were significantly more common in the heartburn group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi>, no significant endoscopic or histological differences between the NERD and control group could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minimal change <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> can be seen with high resolution magnifying endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By combining endoscopic and histological markers NERD can be predicted with a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 74% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> for 4 weeks reverses the slight alterations to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
