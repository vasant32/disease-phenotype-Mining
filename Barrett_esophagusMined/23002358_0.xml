<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 112 surviving post-surgery rats were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (n = 48), which did not receive any treatment; the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> group (n = 32), which were given 2 mg/kg per day of the COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor; and the MF-tricyclic group (n = 32), which received 10 mg/kg per day of the selective COX-2 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Randomly selected rats were killed either 8 wk or 16 wk after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The timing of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> was in accordance with a previous study performed in our group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only rats that were killed at the times designated by the protocol were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then assessed the histology and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) expression levels in the rat esophagi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional group of eight animals that did not undergo esophagojejunostomy were included in order to obtain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal tissue as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to a control group with no treatment (vehicle-treated rats), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> treatment was associated with decreases in ulcerated esophageal mucosa (16% vs 35% and 14% vs 17%, 2 mo and 4 mo after surgery, respectively; P = 0.021), length of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in continuity with anastomosis (2 ± 1.17 mm vs 2.29 ± 0.75 mm and 1.25 ± 0.42 mm vs 3.5 ± 1.54 mm, 2 mo and 4 mo after surgery, respectively; P = 0.007), presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> beyond anastomosis (20% vs 71.4% and 0% vs 60%, 2 mo and 4 mo after surgery, respectively; P = 0.009), severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (0% vs 71.4% and 20% vs 85.7% high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 2 mo and 4 mo after surgery, respectively; P = 0.002), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> incidence (0% vs 57.1% and 0% vs 60%, 2 mo and 4 mo after surgery, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the selective COX-2 inhibitor, MF-tricyclic, did not prevent development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In parallel, we observed a significant decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> levels in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>-treated rats, but not in those treated with MF-tricyclic, at both 2 mo and 4 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to control rats that did not undergo surgery (68 ± 8 ng/g, P = 0.0022 Kruskal-Wallis test) there was a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> levels in the esophageal tissue of the rats that underwent surgery either 2 mo (1332 ± 656 ng/g) or 4 mo (1121 ± 1015 ng/g) after esophagojejunostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no differences were found when esophageal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> levels were compared 2 mo vs 4 mo post-esophagojejunostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At both the 2- and 4-mo timepoints, we observed a significant decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> levels in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>-treated rat esophagi compared to those in either the control or MF-tricyclic groups (P = 0.049 and P = 0.017, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No differences in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> levels were found when we compared levels in rats treated with MF-tricyclic to not-treated rats </plain></SENT>
