<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate trends in funding provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for endoscopic research from 1972 through 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The NIH database of funded biomedical projects for the years 1972 through 2002 was searched using the Computerized Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) and the keyword "endoscopy." Grants were included if a start date, title, and/or specific aims were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Grants were classified as primary endoscopy if the title or specific aim had an endoscopy focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy funding was compared with other nonendoscopic funding for the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1972 through 2002, 133 endoscopy-related grant applications were funded and 98 met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Funding for endoscopic research increased from one grant (1972-1982) to 4 grants (1983-1992) to 93 grants (1993-2002), a 2325% increase for the 1993-2002 decade alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite this increase, there were substantially fewer funded endoscopy-related applications compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> (61,804 grants), Helicobacter pylori (866 grants), and cardiac catheterization (1547 grants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among endoscopic grants, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> projects accounted for the largest portion (34%), followed by advanced optical technologies (18%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Funding for endoscopic research by the NIH has increased dramatically over the past 30 years, but it still lags behind funding in other fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Projects focused on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and optical technologies were most common among those funded, and the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute was the primary source of funding </plain></SENT>
