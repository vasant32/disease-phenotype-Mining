<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the histological alterations occurring in the muscularis mucosae, the lamina propria mucosae, and the submucosa in areas adjacent to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 32 resected esophagi with Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 26 of the 32 specimens, we observed a thickening of the muscularis mucosae, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of the muscle fibers into the lamina propria mucosae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In other areas, collagen-rich fibrotic tissue replaced the muscularis mucosae, the lamina propria mucosae, and even the submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 31 of the 32 specimens, we noted cystic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> of the esophageal glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> esophageal glands and cystically dilated glands with dysplastic lining were often surrounded, compressed, and deformed by the fibrotic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The compression of the glandular outlets by the collagen-rich tissue or by proliferating dysplastic cells appeared to be the two main factors in the histogenesis of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may result in difficulty in differentiating, in biopsy specimens, between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and dysplastic esophageal glands "trapped" in the collagen-rich fibrotic tissue and true invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
