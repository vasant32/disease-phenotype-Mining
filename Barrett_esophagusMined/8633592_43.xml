<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To prospectively determine the clinical features, associated esophageal endoscopic lesions, associated gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of short segment Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients undergoing upper endoscopy over a 5-month period were scrutinized for endoscopic features suggestive of short segment Barrett's, and, if present, multiple biopsies were obtained from the suspicious areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was determined by obtaining biopsies from the antrum, body, and cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred thirty seven patients were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short segment Barrett's was suspected in only 42 patients, and traditional Barrett's was noted in 45 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Short segment Barrett's was confirmed by biopsy in 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation of short segment Barrett's was that of typical or complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> in 53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was the most common associated esophageal endoscopic finding; however, none of the endoscopic findings differed significantly from findings of patients who did not have short segment Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of short segment Barrett's required histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was noted in the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> between the esophagus and stomach in patients with Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was detected in patients with short segment Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short segment Barrett's is a frequent finding in patients undergoing upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with short tongues or patches of red mucosa lying less than 2 cm above the esophagogastric junction should be biopsied to exclude short segment Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Large scale endoscopic and histological surveillance studies along with long-term follow-up are required to clarify short segment Barrett's prevalence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
