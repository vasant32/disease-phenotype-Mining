<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data from a population-based cohort of subjects with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Netherlands Cohort Study was initiated in 1986 and included 120,852 participants (55-69 years old at baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until December 2002, 626 incident cases of BE (excluding nonintestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>) were identified by record linkage with the nationwide Pathology Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This cohort was followed for a median period of 5.7 years; data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and mortality were obtained from record linkage to the Netherlands <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry and Statistics Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expected number of cases was calculated using national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the BE cohort, 13 individuals developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> and 5 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of observed:expected (O:E) incidence of esophageal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> was 10.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3-17.1) and 1.8 (95% CI, 0.6-4.2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence (excluding esophageal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>) increased in the BE cohort, although not by a statistically significant amount (O:E, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> subtypes, incidences of small intestinal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> increased in subjects with BE, but not by a statistically significant amount, after exclusion of data from the first 6 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, 225 individuals with BE died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes (excluding esophageal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>) was not increased among subjects with BE (O:E, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2), nor was mortality from specific causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> was increased in a population-based cohort of subjects with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, when esophageal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> were excluded, total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence and overall mortality were not increased among subjects with BE </plain></SENT>
