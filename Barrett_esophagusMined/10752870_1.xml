<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in patients with SCI as compared with age- and sex-matched controls, using pharmacy data from a large health care system, and the adequacy of the diagnostic evaluation process are evaluated and the symptom and disease severity in patients with SCI who were treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> are assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings show a 22% prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in patients with SCI versus 28% in General Medicine Clinic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the symptom severity is similar in patients with SCI and controls, patients with SCI who have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms undergo endoscopy less frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disturbingly, the prevalence of severe, stage IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> among patients with SCI is higher than controls (p = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results should alert clinicians caring for patients with SCI to more aggressively evaluate and treat such patients with reflux symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation before the development of complications </plain></SENT>
