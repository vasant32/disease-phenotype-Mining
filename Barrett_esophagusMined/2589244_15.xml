<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proximal margin of the gastric folds was used as an endoscopic landmark, corresponding to the gastroesophageal muscular junction (GEMJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No biopsies obtained above the GEMJ in control patients showed columnar mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath> was seen in 21 biopsies of the HHP from patients with CLE or in 13 corresponding biopsies from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, alcian blue (AB) stains showed diffuse acid mucins in 3 of 21 biopsies of the HHP from patients with CLE and in 10 of 13 corresponding biopsies from controls, demonstrating that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath> clearly distinguishes biopsies of CLE from the HHP (P less than 0.01), whereas small amounts of diffuse acid mucin on AB stains do not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IM evidenced by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath> was frequently seen in biopsies only 2-3 cm above the GEMJ, and CLE was limited to that area in three patients, suggesting that the distal esophagus cannot be dismissed as a site for metaplastic and possibly premalignant mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was diagnosed during the course of the study in one patient with only 5 cm of columnar mucosa above the GEMJ </plain></SENT>
