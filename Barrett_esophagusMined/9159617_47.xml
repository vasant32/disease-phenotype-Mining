<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A review of findings and results after standard resection for <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and cardia without neoadjuvant therapy was done to provide a basis for comparison with current reports of radical resection and neoadjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 24-year experience on one surgical service with 454 operations for <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and cardia was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparison of findings and results in three consecutive 8-year intervals was analyzed, and new staging criteria were developed and compared with those currently favored by the American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From January 1, 1970, to January 1, 1994, 454 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus or cardia underwent operation, of whom 408 (90%) had esophagogastrectomy with a 30-day mortality rate of 2.5% and an additional hospital mortality rate of 1.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 121 complications (30.7%), 71 (18%) were major and 50 (12.7%) were minor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular complications predominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival was 24.7%, with a 33.7% survival after complete resections in the most recent interval under study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Palliation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was achieved in nearly 80% of patients who survived the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the three intervals under review, resectability, mortality, and complication rates remained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentages of left thoracotomies and transhiatal resections increased, and there was a decrease in thoracoabdominal incisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentages of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and stage 0 and I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The percentage of complete resections (R0) increased, whereas that for resections with residual microscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (R1) decreased, and there was no change in the percentage of patients with residual gross <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> after resection (R2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Modified WNM staging criteria are proposed that provide better prognostic stratification of the disease than those currently favored by The American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Standard esophagogastrectomy is applicable in 90% of patients with operable <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus or cardia, with consistently low mortality and morbidity rates and satisfactory palliation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival (24.7% overall) remains suboptimal, but the current figure for complete resections (33.7%) is encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There is a need for revision of the current American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> staging criteria </plain></SENT>
