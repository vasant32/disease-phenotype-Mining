<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate somatic genetic abnormalities with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> as predictors of EA in a prospective cohort study of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: Esophageal biopsies from 243 patients with BE were evaluated at baseline for TP53 and CDKN2A (p16) alterations, tetraploidy, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> using sequencing; loss of heterozygosity (LOH); methylation-specific PCR; and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 10 y, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormalities, except CDKN2A mutation and methylation, contributed to EA risk significantly by univariate analysis, ranging from 17p LOH (relative risk [RR] = 10.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2-21.3, p &lt; 0.001) to 9p LOH (RR = 2.6; 95% CI 1.1-6.0, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A panel of abnormalities including 17p LOH, DNA content tetraploidy and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, and 9p LOH was the best predictor of EA (RR = 38.7; 95% CI 10.8-138.5, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with no baseline abnormality had a 12% 10-y cumulative EA incidence, whereas patients with 17p LOH, DNA content abnormalities, and 9p LOH had at least a 79.1% 10-y EA incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with zero, one, two, or three baseline panel abnormalities, there was a significant trend toward EA risk reduction among <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> users compared to nonusers (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The strongest protective effect was seen in participants with multiple genetic abnormalities, with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> nonusers having an observed 10-y EA risk of 79%, compared to 30% for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> users (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A combination of 17p LOH, 9p LOH, and DNA content abnormalities provided better EA risk prediction than any single TP53, CDKN2A, or DNA content lesion alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> are associated with reduced EA risk, especially in patients with multiple high-risk molecular abnormalities </plain></SENT>
