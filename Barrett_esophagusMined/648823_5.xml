<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cells were identical to human intestinal Paneth cells by light microscopy, electron microscopy, and histochemical staining reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospective review of biopsies from 8 additional cases with esophageal specialized columnar epithelium yielded 2 further cases with Paneth cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of Paneth cells, along with goblet cells, suggests that specialized columnar type epithelium in the esophagus may be a form of highly differentiated intestinalization </plain></SENT>
