<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a common strategy for the prevention of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After RFA, the ablated esophagus heals on acid suppressive therapy, and is re-populated with a stratified squamous epithelium, referred to as "neosquamous epithelium (NSE)." Because the ability of the NSE to protect the underlying tissue from recurrent insult by reflux is unclear, we assessed the barrier function of NSE by comparing it to that of the native upper squamous epithelium (USE) in subjects having undergone RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: At varying intervals following RFA, the barrier function of NSE and USE were assessed in endoscopic biopsies by light and electron microscopy, and by measurement of electrical resistance (R) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> flux in mini-Ussing chambers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chamber results were further compared with results from control biopsies (healthy distal esophagus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A claudin expression profile in the tight junctions (TJs) of NSE and USE was determined using Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differential expression of claudin-4 between NSE and USE was assayed by immunoblots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: USE was histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> whereas NSE showed dilated intercellular spaces and marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NSE was also more permeable than USE and healthy controls, having lower mean R and higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> fluxes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormally low R values for NSE were unrelated to the time period following RFA (or number of prior RFA sessions), being abnormal even 26 months after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Abnormal permeability in NSE was associated with significantly lower values for claudin-4 and claudin-10 than in USE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NSE commonly exhibits defective barrier function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As this defect will make it vulnerable to injury, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and destruction by acidic and weakly acidic refluxates, it may in part explain incidences of recurrence of BE following ablation </plain></SENT>
