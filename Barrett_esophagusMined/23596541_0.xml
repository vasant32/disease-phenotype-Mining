<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the endocytoscopic visualization of squamous cell islands within Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endocytoscopy (ECS) has been studied in the surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, with controversial results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In initial studies, however, a soft catheter type endocytoscope was used, while only <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> dye was used for the staining of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Integrated type endocytoscopes (GIF-Q260 EC, Olympus Corp, Tokyo, Japan) have been recently developed, with the incorporation of a high-power magnifying endocytoscope into a standard endoscope together with narrow-band imaging (NBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, double staining with a mixture of 0.05% crystal violet and 0.1% of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> (CM) during ECS enables higher quality images comparable to conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> eosin histopathological images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vivo endocytoscopic visualization of papillary squamous cell islands within glandular Barrett's epithelium in a patient with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conventional white light endoscopy showed typical long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, with small squamous cell islands within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Barrett's mucosa, which were better visualized by NBI endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ECS after double CM staining showed regular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, while higher magnification (Ã— 480) revealed the orifices of glandular structures better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, typical squamous cell papillary protrusion, classified as endocytoscopic atypia classification (ECA) 2 according to ECA, was identified within regular glandular Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of biopsies taken from the same area showed squamous epithelium within glandular Barrett's mucosa, corresponding well to endocytoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of in vivo visualization of esophageal papillary squamous cell islands surrounded by glandular Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
