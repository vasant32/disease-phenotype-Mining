<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive patients with precancerous or early malignant esophageal lesions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, Tis, T1, and T2 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings of these patients were compared with 66 patients who had reported increased esophageal (18)F-FDG uptake due to benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesions were evaluated with scores using the following characteristics in PET/CT: FDG uptake intensity (low = 0, moderate = 1, high = 2), FDG uptake eccentricity (concentric = 0, eccentric = 1), FDG uptake focality (diffuse = 0, segmental = 1, focal = 2), esophageal thickness on the CT component (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> = 0, thickening = 1, mass = 2), and location (distal third of the esophagus = 0, middle third of the esophagus = 1, proximal third of the esophagus = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early malignant lesions had higher scores in FDG uptake intensity (p = 0.003; chi-square), eccentricity (p &lt; 0.001), and focality (p &lt; 0.001) compared with benign lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was seen in esophageal thickness on CT (p = 0.168) and in location of the lesion (p = 0.291) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binary logistic regression analysis with a stepwise forward inclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> score components including the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the lesions revealed that a total score combining eccentricity and focality scores has the highest accuracy of predicting early malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a threshold of equal or higher than 2 in the combined total focality-eccentricity score, the sensitivity was 83.3% and specificity was 68.2% for predicting early malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Focality and eccentricity of FDG uptake prove to be valuable PET/CT characteristics for the differentiation of nonspecific FDG uptake in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
