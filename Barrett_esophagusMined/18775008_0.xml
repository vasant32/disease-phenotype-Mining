<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current strategies to deal with this situation are problematic, and the time has come for new approaches to this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chemoprevention is one such approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, Hur et al. examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patient preferences for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemoprevention with either aspirin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They found that 93% of their patients were willing to take one of these two drugs, but that nearly five times as many patients preferred aspirin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> (76%vs 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most important reason for willingness to use <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> or aspirin was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention, while the most important reason for not using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> was risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and for aspirin gastrointestinal adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While this study indicates that there is a strong interest among <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients for chemoprevention, it is still premature for our patients to embark on such an approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of chemoprevention in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> still awaits the results of ongoing clinical trials in the United Kingdom and North America </plain></SENT>
