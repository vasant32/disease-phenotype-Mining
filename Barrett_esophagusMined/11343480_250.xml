<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term outcome of medical and surgical therapies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Follow-up study conducted from October 1997 through October 1999 of a prospective randomized trial of medical and surgical antireflux treatments in patients with complicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean (median) duration of follow-up was 10.6 years (7.3 years) for medical patients and 9.1 years (6.3 years) for surgical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-nine (97%) of the original 247 study patients were found (79 were confirmed dead) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 160 survivors (157 men and 3 women; mean [SD] age, 67 [12] years), 129 (91 in the medical treatment group and 38 in the surgical treatment group) participated in the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Use of antireflux medication, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</z:hpo> Activity Index (GRACI) scores, grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, frequency of treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, frequency of subsequent antireflux operations, 36-item Short Form health survey (SF-36) scores, satisfaction with antireflux therapy, survival, and incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, compared between the medical antireflux therapy group and the fundoplication surgery group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Information on cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was obtained from autopsy results, hospital records, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-three (92%) of 90 medical patients and 23 (62%) of 37 surgical patients reported that they used antireflux medications regularly (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a 1-week period after discontinuation of medication, mean (SD) GRACI symptom scores were significantly lower in the surgical treatment group (82.6 [17.5] vs 96.7 [21.4] in the medical treatment group; P =.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no significant differences between the groups were found in grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, frequency of treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> and subsequent antireflux operations, SF-36 standardized physical and mental component scale scores, and overall satisfaction with antireflux therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival during a period of 140 months was decreased significantly in the surgical vs the medical treatment group (relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the medical group, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.46; P =.047), largely because of excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> at baseline developed esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> at an annual rate of 0.4%, whereas these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> developed in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> at an annual rate of only 0.07% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between groups in incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that antireflux surgery should not be advised with the expectation that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> will no longer need to take antisecretory medications or that the procedure will prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> among those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
