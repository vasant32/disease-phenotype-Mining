<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> frequently develops on a background of metaplastic Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> is accompanied by genetic alterations, which may be promising biomarkers of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case control study was conducted nested within a large unselected population based cohort of Barrett's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident oesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each case up to five controls were matched on age, sex, and year of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies from the time of diagnosis of Barrett's epithelium were stained immunohistochemically for TP53, cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and beta-catenin proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty nine incident oesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and six cases of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds of diffuse or intense TP53 staining were substantially elevated in biopsies from patients who developed oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> compared with controls (odds ratio (OR) 11.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93, 71.4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference was also present when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were considered (OR 8.42 (95% CI 2.37, 30.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the association with TP53 staining, only 32.4% of cases had an initial biopsy showing diffuse/intense TP53 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant associations between cyclin D1, COX-2, or beta-catenin staining and case control status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The OR for positive staining for both TP53 and COX-2 was markedly increased in cases compared with controls (OR 27.3 (95% CI 2.89, 257.0)) although only 15% of cases had positive staining for both markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical detection of TP53 expression is a biomarker of malignant progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> but sensitivity is too low to act as a criterion to inform endoscopic surveillance strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additional biomarkers are required which when combined with TP53 will identify, with adequate sensitivity and specificity, Barrett's patients who are at risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
