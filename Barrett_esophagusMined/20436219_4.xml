<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the precise role of different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> in this process is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of two different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (DCA) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9907">ursodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (UDCA) on the expression of COX-2, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 and DNA repair enzymes (MUTYH, OGG-1) in the Barrett epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells (OE-19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OE-19 cells were incubated with DCAor UDCA(100 microM or 300 microM at pH=7.0) over 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the involvement of NF kappaB, in separate experiments the cells were incubated with DCA in the presence of proteosome inhibitor (MG-132) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells cycle and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were analyzed by FACS analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After incubation of OE-19 cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi>, the expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of COX-2, DNA repair enzymes (MUTYH, OGG-1) and caudal-related homebox transcription factor <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 were measured by quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OE-19 cell were also transfected with siRNA-RelA (p65) to asses effect of NF kappaB inactivation on COX-2 and CDX2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DCA caused a stronger reduction in cell survival of OE-19 cells than UDCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, DCA stimulated directly the translocation of NF kappaB p65 (active form) in the nuclei of OE-19 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DCA caused stronger than UDCA stimulation of the COX-2 mRNA expression in these cells and this effect was significantly attenuated by the addition of inhibitor of NF kappaB activity (proteosome inhibitor MG-132) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>siRNA-RelA reduced expression not only of NF kappaB but also expression of COX-2 as well as <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DCA caused stronger downregulation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for DNA repair enzymes MUTYH and OGG-1 than UDCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, UDCA induced stronger <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 mRNA expression than DCA in OE-19 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> are involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> via inhibition of DNA repair enzymes and induction of COX-2 and this last effect is, at least partly, mediated by NF kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>DCA shows carcinogenic potential due to high upregulation of COX-2, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 and downregulation of DNA repair enzymes </plain></SENT>
