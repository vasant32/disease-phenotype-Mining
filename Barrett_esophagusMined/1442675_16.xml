<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significant pathology was diagnosed in 19 patients (27%), eight patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, three with esophageal or gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath>, two with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>, and two with biopsy-proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> and demonstrated a 38% prevalence of significant pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents</z:chebi> had a 30% prevalence of significant pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was noted between subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, asymptomatic patients without a colonic source to explain a positive FOBT often have significant lesions, on upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>Iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> did not have an impact on pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because treatment and follow-up plans were altered in many of the cases in which significant pathology was demonstrated, we conclude that upper endoscopy should be seriously considered for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> asymptomatic patients with occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> and a negative colonoscopic examination </plain></SENT>
