<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was performed in which 91 cases with EAC and 244 controls with histologically confirmed BE (&gt;2 cm) with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information on demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle characteristics, physical activity levels, working posture, family history, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) symptoms, and medication use was collected by questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cases more often were current smokers (odds ratio 3.7, 95% confidence interval 1.4-9.9), more often had a body mass index &gt;25 assessed at age 20 (2.6, 1.2-5.5), and more frequently had been working in a stooped posture at age 20 (2.0, 1.1-3.9), compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, cases less often experienced symptoms of heartburn (0.3, 0.2-0.5) and less frequently used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (0.1, 0.05-0.2), compared to controls, whereas use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>/aspirin was more common among cases (1.8, 1.1-3.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases more often were men, compared to controls (91%vs 67%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with BE, the risk of EAC is related to risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, which is, however, asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As these risk factors are common in Western countries, they are probably not helpful in individualization of surveillance intervals </plain></SENT>
