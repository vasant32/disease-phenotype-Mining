<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Incidence of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OAC) is increasing rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OAC arises in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined oesophagus</z:e> (CLO), a metaplastic change affecting some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (GORD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As yet there is no reliable method of identifying those at highest risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our earlier observation of an association between OAC and blood group O Rhesus negative, if confirmed, may help identify those at greatest risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM AND METHODS: To assess the distribution of blood group and Rhesus D (RhD) factor in patients with GORD compared with the blood donating general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GORD was categorized as nonerosive reflux (NER), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267055" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erosive oesophagitis</z:e>, CLO and OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Rotherham Hospital database holds details of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GORD, CLO and OAC patients seen in the Gastroenterology Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood group information for patients with GORD was obtained from patients' records and the hospital's blood transfusion service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The blood group distribution in the general population was obtained from the National Blood Transfusion Service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of expected to observed patients in each blood group for each subtype was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two thousand six hundred and ten NER, 2813 erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, 568 CLO and 73 OAC patients had a recorded blood group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For RhD positive patients observed proportions in each blood group were similar to expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most striking difference was the marked excess of OAC in blood group O, Rhesus negative (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CLO patients with blood group O, RhD negative carry a disproportionately higher risk of developing OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mechanism is unknown but the finding has practical application in guiding risk stratification and intensity of surveillance </plain></SENT>
