<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surveillance of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is recommended to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 1998, practice guidelines for the surveillance of patients with BE were developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective is to assess physicians' awareness of agreement with and adherence to these guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A national prospective cohort study of practicing gastroenterologists who completed a self-administered questionnaire containing case studies prior to the release of the guidelines and another survey 18 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of adherence to the guidelines was done using the McNemar chi(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 154 gastroenterologists (66%) who responded to the follow-up survey, more than half (55%) were aware of the guidelines, and members of the ACG were more likely to know of their existence than nonmembers (61% vs 38%; P =.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, about 27% of physicians reported practicing in accordance with the guidelines at baseline; adherence increased modestly to 38% in the 18-month follow-up (P =.04) and was inversely related to fee-for-service reimbursement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Awareness was not associated with an increased likelihood of adherence, but agreement with the guidelines was strongly correlated with adherence (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent reasons for disagreement were concerns about liability, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk, and inadequate evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of the guidelines published by the ACG was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Guideline awareness did not predict adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improvement in guideline adherence will require steps beyond mere dissemination and promotion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Addressing disagreements about liability, disease risk, and scientific evidence as well as restructuring payment incentives may help achieve optimal practice </plain></SENT>
