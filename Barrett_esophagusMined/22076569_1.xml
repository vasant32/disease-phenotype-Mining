<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A human model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> was used to examine the contribution of a non-specialized columnar type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (NSCM) and key molecular events (BMP4 and CDX2) in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsies of the remnant esophagus from 18 patients undergoing esophagectomy with gastric preservation were taken at 6-36-month intervals postoperatively and examined for activation of the BMP pathway (BMP4/P-Smad 1/5/8) and CDX2 and CDX1 expression by imunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A short segment (mean 15.6 mm) of NSCM was detected in 10 (56%) patients, with an increasing prevalence from 17% at 6 months to 62% at 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nuclear expression of P-Smad 1/5/8 in the squamous epithelium close to the anastomosis with strong expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> epithelial cells of NSCM areas was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight (63%) biopsies with NSCM showed scattered nuclear expression of CDX2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two cases showed isolated glands at 18, 24, and 36 months that fully expressed CDX2 and co-expressed CDX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMP4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and CDX2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were significantly greater in NSCM than in squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BMP4 activation in NSCM and early expression of CDX2 are involved in the columnar epithelial differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
