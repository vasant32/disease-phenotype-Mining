<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, gastric incomplete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> arising in Short Segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> can be indistinguishable histologically on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>/eosin stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distinct patterns of CK 7 and CK 20 immunohistochemical expression have been demonstrated to be both highly sensitive and specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but have not been found in <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to test whether immunostaining with CK 7/20 helps to distinguish between Barrett's epithelium and gastric incomplete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases of long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and cases with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastroesophageal junction, as well as specimens with gastric antral intestninal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, were examined: three patterns were defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Barrett's pattern (superficial CK 20 staining; superficial and crypt CK 7 staining); gastric pattern (superficial and crypt staining of both markers); other patterns (different from Barrett and gastric types) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five patients were enrolled in this study, 26 with long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 21 with short segment esophagus, 13 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the cardia, and 18 with antral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Barrett pattern showed a high specificity of 97%, but a sensitivity of only 30% in patients with short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results do not confirm the hypothesis that CK 7/20 immunostaining can be used for a reliable differentiation between incomplete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
