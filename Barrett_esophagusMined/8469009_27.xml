<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since 1985, 229 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus have been considered for entry into a protocol with the use of preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by surgical intervention as the primary element of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty-five patients (93 with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 72 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>) had esophagogastrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival of the protocol patients who underwent resection was 25% for both groups--<z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the protocol patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> who underwent resection, 40% had a sterilized specimen, whereas of those with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 20% had a sterilized specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the patient had a sterilized specimen, the 5-year survival was approximately 60% for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 40% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had a 5-year survival of 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who underwent only esophagectomy and esophagogastrectomy and had not been entered into the protocol, none lived beyond 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality rate for those who had esophagogastrectomy was 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four patients completed the radiation therapy and chemotherapy but did not undergo surgical procedures because of progressive disease or refusal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of those patients who completed chemotherapy and radiation therapy without surgical intervention, 5-year survival was 18% in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, whereas no patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> survived beyond 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The finding of a sterilized specimen after esophagectomy is a favorable prognostic factor in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The finding that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> have an improved chance for survival is perhaps related to an earlier diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is clear that some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> who did not undergo surgical procedures did have a sterilized specimen, because the survival in this group approached 20% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
