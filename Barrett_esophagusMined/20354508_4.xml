<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the prevalence of clinically significant endoscopic findings (CSEFs) in Chinese patients presenting with uninvestigated typical reflux symptoms in the absence of alarm symptoms, and to evaluate whether prompt endoscopy is an appropriate initial management in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting with uninvestigated typical reflux symptoms (i.e., heartburn or acid regurgitation) as chief complaints were recruited for symptom evaluation and upper endoscopy, followed by a 2-week <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 469 patients recruited, CSEFs were observed in 180 (38.4%): 154 (32.8%) with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EE), 18 (3.8%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), 24 (5.1%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PUD</z:e>), and 4 (0.9%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> and 3 <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinomas</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified that an age &gt;50 years (odds ratio (OR)=1.94, P=0.008), male gender (OR=4.11, P&lt;0.001), being overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (OR=2.99, P&lt;0.001), and alcohol use (OR=9.96, P&lt;0.001) were independent risk factors for EE; an age &gt;50 years (OR=4.61, P=0.003) and alcohol use (OR=5.50, P=0.003) were independent risk factors for BE; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> (OR=8.52, P&lt;0.001) and alcohol use (OR=4.08, P=0.004) were independent risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PUD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptom evaluation and response to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment were not correlated with EE, BE, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PUD</z:e> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CSEFs other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> are present in a considerable proportion of Chinese patients with uninvestigated typical reflux symptoms but without alarm features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptom evaluation is of limited practical value, and thus prompt endoscopy seems to be an appropriate initial management option in these patients </plain></SENT>
