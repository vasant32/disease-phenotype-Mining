<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tests the hypothesis that re-injury of the metaplastic the epithelium in an acid-controlled environment will result in reversal of Barrett's to squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with at least 2 cm of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi>, and half the circumference of the Barrett's was treated with multipolar electrocoagulation (MPEC); the other half served as an internal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 6 months, the remaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was treated with MPEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four hour esophageal pH of less than 4 averaged 1.8% on a mean dose of 56 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had visual and biopsy elimination of the targeted section of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> after an average of 2.5 MPEC sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remainder of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is being treated in 9 patients; currently 5 have no evidence of Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of control of esophageal acid exposure and reinjury of the metaplastic epithelium reverses <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to squamous epithelium as determined by endoscopy and biopsy </plain></SENT>
