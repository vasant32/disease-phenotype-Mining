<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A major limitation to screening and surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is the complexity, expense, and risk associated with sedation for upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the feasibility, accuracy, and patient acceptability of office-based unsedated endoscopy as an alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 274 eligible adults scheduled for endoscopic screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms or surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at a tertiary care center, 121 underwent unsedated small-caliber endoscopy and conventional endoscopy in a randomized crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two procedures were compared with regard to histological detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and biopsy size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients answered questionnaires assessing the tolerability of the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was 26% using conventional endoscopy and 30% using unsedated endoscopy (P= 0.503) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of agreement between the two approaches was "moderate" (kappa= 0.591) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each modality detected four cases of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with concordance on one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The tissue samples collected with unsedated endoscopy were smaller than with conventional endoscopy (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of subjects rated their experience with both procedures as being well tolerated with minimal or no difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When asked which procedure they would prefer in the future, 71% (81/114) chose unsedated small-caliber endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Office-based unsedated small-caliber endoscopy is technically feasible, well tolerated, and accurate in screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, despite yielding a smaller biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This approach bears the potential to eliminate the infrastructure and cost required for intravenous sedation in this application </plain></SENT>
