<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study examined the association between 17p allelic loss and p53 gene mutation in a series of 16 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arising on a background of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two highly polymorphic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat polymorphisms mapping to 17p13 were analyzed to assess the frequency of 17p allelic loss in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the p53 gene were detected by direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four % (15 of 16) of samples were informative at one or both polymorphic loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allelic loss at one or both loci was detected in 80% (12 of 15) of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations were detected in 69% (11 of 16) esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, and there was a close association between 17p allelic loss and p53 gene mutation (P = 0.00879; Fisher's Exact Test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that were analyzed demonstrated a specific p53 mutation spectrum, with G:C to A:T base transitions at CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> accounting for 80% (8 of 10) of single-base substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three cases, the same p53 mutation was detected in both high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and adjacent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that p53 gene alterations contribute to the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and precede the development of invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
