<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) are inhibitors of cytokine signalling; methylation of SOCS-3 has been implicated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of liver as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study was performed to elucidate the role of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and its precursor lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA of specimens from 19 Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, 56 Barrett's intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> (n = 29 low grade and n = 27 high grade), 30 Barrett's mucosa without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, 20 samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous and gastric epithelium and four cell lines were studied using methylation specific PCR for the SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 promoter following microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of SOCS-3 mRNA transcripts was confirmed by semiquantitative real time PCR, and the SOCS-3 protein was analysed immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa, neither SOCS-3 nor SOCS-1 methylation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's mucosa without intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, SOCS-3 methylation occurred in 4/30 cases (13%) whereas SOCS-1 was unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A hypermethylated SOCS-3 promoter was found in 14/19 Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (74%) and in 20/29 high and 6/27 low grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> (69% and 22%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SOCS-1 promoter hypermethylation occurred in 8/19 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (42%) and in 6/29 high grade and 1/27 low grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> (21% and 4%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Methylation of the SOCS-3 promoter correlated with downregulation of SOCS-3 transcripts and protein expression in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and various cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the cell lines tested, SOCS-3 and SOCS-1 transcripts increased after treatment with the demethylation compound 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that promoter methylation and subsequent transcript downregulation of SOCS-3 transcripts and, to a much lesser extent, SOCS-1 are involved in the multistep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
