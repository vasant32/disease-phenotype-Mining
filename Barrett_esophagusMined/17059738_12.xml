<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine before Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) in asymptomatic morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients: 1) the prevalence of abnormal findings at upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy; 2) Helicobacter pylori (HP) status; 3) clinical consequences of these findings; and 4) associated costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 468 consecutive patients, excluded those with UGI symptoms, drug intake or previous UGI endoscopy/surgery, and analyzed findings in the 319 remaining patients (68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were abnormal findings in 147 patients (46%), including 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> and 146 parietal (i.e. mucosal or submucosal) lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most significant were 7 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0003299'>gastric polyposis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HP was detected (using CLO-test) in 124 patients (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination of biopsies was abnormal in 109/161 patients (68%), and disclosed mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0005231'>chronic gastritis</z:hpo> (n=98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormal findings were more frequent in HP-positive compared to HP-negative patients (94 vs 51%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings had clinical implications in only 4% of patients: delayed surgery (7 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>), prophylactic gastrectomy (2 <z:mp ids='MP_0003299'>gastric polyposis</z:mp>), unnecessary work-up (3 irrelevant/false-positive diagnoses), and inclusion in a screening program (1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean cost of complete UGI work-up was 389 euro/patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients frequently harbour UGI lesions warranting UGI work-up before RYGBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, routine endoscopy presents drawbacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We propose a less invasive strategy which reduces costs and limits false-positive results and the subsequent investigations that they require </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our series, it would have missed two <z:mp ids='MP_0003299'>gastric polyposis</z:mp> only, for which no formal recommendation has yet been issued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This strategy could be a valuable alternative to routine UGI endoscopy before RYGBP in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
