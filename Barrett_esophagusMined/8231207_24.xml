<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and intraoperative staging defined three distinct subgroups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those with apparently limited disease and good general health (group I, n = 30) underwent en bloc resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those with apparently limited disease but poor physiologic reserve (group II, n = 16) underwent transhiatal resection, as did those with evidence of more advanced disease (group III, n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, survival was significantly better in the 30 patients who underwent en bloc resection (41%) than in the 39 patients who underwent transhiatal resections (14%; p &lt; 0.001, log-rank) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical staging showed apparently limited disease in 46 patients (groups I and II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These groups differed only in the presence of poor physiologic reserve because the percentages of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> limited to the esophageal wall (group I 13/30, group II 6/16) and four or fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> (group I 21/30, group II 15/16) at the time of pathologic staging were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival after en bloc resection was, however, significantly better (41% versus 21%; p &lt; 0.05, log-rank) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to the WNM system of pathologic staging, 19 patients had early lesions defined as intramural lesions associated with four or fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e>, 26 had intermediate lesions defined as either transmural or associated with more than four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e>, and 24 had late lesions defined as both transmural and associated with fewer than four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival was significantly better in patients with early lesions after en bloc resection compared with transhiatal resection (75% versus 20%, p &lt; 0.01), survival was also significantly better in patients with advanced lesions (27% versus 9%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For intermediate lesions, the survival was similar (14% versus 20%), although the median survival after en bloc resection was longer (24 months versus 8 months) </plain></SENT>
