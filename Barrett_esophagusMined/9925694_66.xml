<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of unsuspected <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at esophagectomy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> after endoscopic surveillance with jumbo biopsy forceps compared with standard biopsy forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without gross or microscopic evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> underwent esophagectomy after preoperative endoscopy with 4-quadrant jumbo biopsies at 2-cm intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings in this group were compared with those in a group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who underwent esophagectomy for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> after biopsies obtained at 2-cm intervals with standard biopsy forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unsuspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was found in 4 of 12 (33%) patients in the jumbo biopsy group compared with 6 of 16 (38%) in the standard biopsy group (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 cancers in the standard biopsy group were intramucosal, whereas 2 were intramucosal and 2 were submucosal in the jumbo biopsy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patients in either group had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unsuspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is found frequently in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who are undergoing esophagectomy for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> despite the use of a rigorous jumbo biopsy protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophageal resection is still indicated in appropriately selected patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> until better markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk are available </plain></SENT>
