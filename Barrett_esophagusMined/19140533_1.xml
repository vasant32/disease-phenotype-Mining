<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Transnasal esophagoscopy (TNE) is rapidly becoming integrated into otolaryngological practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent report has shown an incongruence between an endoscopic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and biopsy-proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1168250" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngopharyngeal reflux</z:e> (LPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine whether performing TNE with narrowband imaging (NBI) improves on the diagnostic yield in the otolaryngologist's hands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Narrowband imaging involves the use of filtered light to enhance the mucosal microvasculature pattern and has been shown to be highly sensitive to detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> under conventional esophagoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 111 patients with LPR who underwent TNE by the same otolaryngologist was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pentax EE-1580K (white light only) and Olympus GIF-N180 (with NBI) endoscopes were used in 58 and 53 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microcup biopsy of the squamocolumnar junction was obtained when <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biopsy-proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was found in 13.5% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to white light only and NBI, 7 of 58 (12.1%) and 8 of 53 (15.1%), respectively, had biopsy-proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy (2.7%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases were detected under NBI (5.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Narrowband imaging may be a useful adjunct in increasing the diagnostic sensitivity of TNE in the hands of the otolaryngologist </plain></SENT>
