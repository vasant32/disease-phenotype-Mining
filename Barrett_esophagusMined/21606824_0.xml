<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hyperplastic (inflammatory) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi>) of the gastric corpus and antrum typically develop in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005231'>chronic gastritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known regarding the etiology, pathologic features, and natural history of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have noted, anecdotally, that GEJ <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> often occur in patients without gastric pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical, pathologic, and outcome features of patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> of the GEJ, and to compare the data with a control group of individuals with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> in the gastric corpus or antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty-four consecutive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of the GEJ were identified by a 5-year search through the pathology files of a major tertiary-care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 46 (36%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> from 46 patients met the pathologic criteria for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> and formed the basis of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 46 study patients, and their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, were evaluated for a wide variety of clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic features including outcome on follow-up endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings were compared with 46 HPs from 46 patients of the distal stomach (antrum or corpus) that were obtained randomly from the same 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with gastric antral or corpus <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi>, patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> of the GEJ were significantly younger in age (mean age, 55.9 y vs. 63.0 y; P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathologically, GEJ <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> showed a significantly higher rate of multilayered epithelium (P=0.06) and association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) (P=0.0001) compared with distal gastric <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BE-associated GEJ <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> were associated with either ultrashort (&lt;1 cm) or short segment (1 to 3 cm) BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other pathologic variables, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, were similar to those of distal gastric <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In a subanalysis, BE-associated GEJ <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> (33% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GEJ <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi>) showed a higher male to female ratio and a higher rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, none of the BE-associated GEJ <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> versus the non-BE-associated GEJ <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi>, although this was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only 1 HP (from the GEJ) from both the study and control groups was associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> (signet-ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>On follow-up, 1 patient with a GEJ HP and 4 with distal gastric <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> developed recurrent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> and none of the patients from either patient group developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, unlike <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> of the gastric corpus or antrum, a significant proportion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46711">HPs</z:chebi> of the GEJ arise in association with BE and without gastric pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In patients with BE, the columnar-lined segment is often ultrashort, and thus, an HP may be the first clinical/endoscopic manifestation of that disorder </plain></SENT>
