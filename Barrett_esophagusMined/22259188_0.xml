<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggest some effects of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> on risk of several <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases, which may be mediated through a small number of selenoenzymes with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this cross-sectional analysis of 195 participants from the Seattle <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> Study who were free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> at the time of blood draw, we examined whether the number of the minor alleles in 26 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of five selenoenzyme genes [i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase 1-4 (GPX1-4) and selenoprotein P (SEPP1)] was associated with activity of GPX1 in white blood cells and GPX3 in plasma, and concentrations of SEPP1 and markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> [malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> content] in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the gene level, associations were observed between overall variation in GPX1 and GPX1 activity (P = 0.02) as well as between overall variation in GPX2 and SEPP1 concentrations (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By individual SNP, two variants in GPX1 (rs8179164 and rs1987628) showed a suggestive association with GPX1 activity (P = 0.10 and 0.08, respectively) and two GPX2 variants (rs4902346 and rs2071566) were associated with SEPP1 concentration (P = 0.004 and 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two SNP in the SEPP1 gene (rs230813 and rs230819) were associated with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> concentrations (P = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, our study supports the hypothesis that common genetic variants in selenoenzymes affect their activity </plain></SENT>
