<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A hundred forty-one patients who were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333763" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastric cardia cancer</z:e> and underwent surgery between January 1990 and December 2006 by single surgeon at Department of Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test were used for survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was recognized in two patients so called type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences between type II and III in aspect of depth of invasion, Lauren's classification, and the number of retrieved lymph nodes in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> infiltrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In type III, prognostic factors affecting survival were depth of invasion and nodal status in contrast to the no demonstrable prognostic factors existing in type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there were no differences in recurrence and survival between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several clinicopathologic differences exist between type II and III cardia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the future, further evaluation is needed regarding the classification and entities of the cardia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
