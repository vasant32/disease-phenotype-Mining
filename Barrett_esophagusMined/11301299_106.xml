<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We provide a systematic framework for assessing the results of clustering algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clustering algorithms attempt to partition the genes into groups exhibiting similar patterns of variation in expression level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our methodology is to apply a clustering algorithm to the data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one experimental condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining condition is used to assess the predictive power of the resulting clusters-meaningful clusters should exhibit less variation in the remaining condition than clusters formed by chance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We successfully applied our methodology to compare six clustering algorithms on four gene expression data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found our quantitative measures of cluster quality to be positively correlated with external standards of cluster quality </plain></SENT>
