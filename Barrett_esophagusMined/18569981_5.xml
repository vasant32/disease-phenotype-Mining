<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), refluxed gastric juice can damage the esophagus, and hence the more acidic the juice, the more the expected damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nocturnal acid breakthrough (NAB) is known to occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients on treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>); however, whether this causes esophageal acidification and symptoms is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship between gastric acid and the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and the esophageal acidification and symptoms during NAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were evaluated using endoscopy (graded according to the Los Angeles (LA) classification), manometry and 24-h dual-channel pH-metry for esophageal and gastric acid profile and follow-up pH-metry while on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> for NAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 61 patients (39.2+/-12.8 years, 40 M) the endoscopic grading was endoscopy negative (ENRD) in 19 (32%), endoscopic (ERD) in 40 (68%), (LA-A in 25, 42.4%, LA-B in12, 20.3%, peptic stricture in 2, 3.4%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 1, 1.7%) and 2 patients were unclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the different groups had comparable gastric acid profiles, though esophageal acid exposure was different (LA-B and above versus ENRD, p=0.007; LA-B and above versus LA-A, p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with NAB (7/18, 39%) had lower gastric pH than patients without NAB (p=0.003) though average esophageal pH and esophageal acid exposure were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequency of nocturnal symptoms was comparable in patients with or without NAB (2/7 versus 3/11, p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure was negatively correlated with average gastric pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is related to esophageal acid exposure, it does not correlate to gastric acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in esophageal acid exposure and nocturnal symptoms in patients with or without NAB </plain></SENT>
