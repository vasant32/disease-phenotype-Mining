<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgically induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> has become the best treatment for morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the most common procedure performed worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concerns regarding difficulties in further evaluation of stomach remnant for early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, however, have emphasized the routine use of preoperative upper endoscopy, even in asymptomatic patients, to detect upper gastrointestinal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome of this study was to identify the most common preoperative endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data was collected from a prospective database and medical records of patients with available endoscopic reports, who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass from February 1999 to June 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was performed to detect preoperative clinical variables that might be associated with abnormal endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six hundred twenty-six patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four hundred fifty-two (72%) were female; age and body mass index were 38.5 +/- 11.3 years and 42 +/- 6.5 kg/m(2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities were found in 288 (46%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The age of patients with abnormal and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endoscopy was 40 +/- 11 and 36.8 +/- 11 years, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common findings were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> 21% (n = 132), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> 16% (n = 100), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> 10.7% (n = 67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Duodenitis</z:e> has a frequency of 7.8% (n = 49), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcers</z:hpo> of 2.7%(n = 17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo> of 2.6% (n = 16), <z:mp ids='MP_0003299'>gastric polyps</z:mp> of 1.3% (n = 8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of 0.16% (n = 1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> of 0.16% (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Age was the only clinical variable associated to abnormal endoscopy (odds ratio = 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Routine preoperative endoscopy detects different abnormalities which need specific approach prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Preoperative endoscopy should be performed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
