<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience with the surgical management of these patients to determine their clinical characteristics, pathologic findings, and treatment results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients were identified through our surgical pathology database, and their medical records were reviewed to determine clinical characteristics, treatment, treatment-associated mortality, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging, presence of Barrett's mucosa, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our series, patients were white (100%) males (96.9%) with a history of reflux (56.3%), cigarette smoking (40.6%), and alcohol consumption (59.4%), who presented with progressive solid food <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (78.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A prior diagnosis of Barrett's mucosa or use of antireflux medications was noted in five patients each (15.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was 81.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 66.1 to 96.2) at 12 months, 68.5% (95% CI 49.5 to 87.5) at 24 months, and 56.9% (95% CI 34.6 to 79.1) at 60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> 45 years of age or younger have similar clinical findings to those reported in other large series where the median age is in the sixth or seventh decade of life, supporting a uniform theory of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy may be performed with low mortality, and survival is reasonable for early-stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are not immune from the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and need to be screened accordingly </plain></SENT>
