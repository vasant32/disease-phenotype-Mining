<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the widespread practice of endoscopic surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in the West, this strategy has not been shown to reduce mortality from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coupled with the very low absolute annual risk of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of 0.1%, this has called into question as to whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is an over-hyped condition in the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, it is widely assumed that the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is low in Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>Could there be under-recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, resulting in the underdiagnosis of the disease in the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our own study noted a much higher prevalence of histologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> following increased interest in endoscopic investigation of this disease, suggesting the low prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> reported in most parts of Asia could have been attributed, at least in part, to underdiagnosis and/or lack of awareness of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Training in the use of standardized diagnostic criteria could enhance diagnosis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a recent study conducted by the Asia-Pacific Barrett's Consortium, formal training in the endoscopic recognition of columnar-lined Barrett's segment enhanced endoscopists' detection of the disease and led to significantly higher diagnostic yield (1.5% vs 0.42% in untrained endoscopists) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of advanced endoscopic imaging technology such as narrow-band imaging improved the negative predictive value in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>'s associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Raman spectroscopy, a novel biomolecular probe-based technology that does not rely upon operator's interpretation of images, could potentially enhance the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
