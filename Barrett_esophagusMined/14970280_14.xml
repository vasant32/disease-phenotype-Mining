<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, including aspirin, may prevent the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, use of aspirin is associated with numerous potential complications, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a modeling approach to determine and compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of aspirin with and without endoscopic surveillance to prevent esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Markov Monte Carlo decision model was constructed to compare four strategies for management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>: aspirin therapy, endoscopic surveillance with biopsies, both, or neither </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who took a daily enteric-coated aspirin were modeled to have a 50% reduction in the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> but could have complications related to therapy, at which point the aspirin was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potential cardiac benefits of aspirin and its role in the chemoprevention of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were not included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis was from a societal perspective from age 55 years until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the effects of changes in model parameters on estimated costs and effectiveness outcomes across a wide range of assumptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aspirin therapy was more effective and less costly than no therapy, resulting in 0.19 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combination of aspirin and endoscopic surveillance produced 0.27 more QALYs than no therapy at a cost of 13,400 U.S. dollars more, for an associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 49,600 U.S. dollars/QALY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aspirin use in combination with endoscopic surveillance dominated endoscopic surveillance alone, resulting in 0.06 more QALYs and 11,400 U.S. dollars less cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The model's results were sensitive to increasing age and to decreased benefit or delay in aspirin's chemopreventive efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using published values of parameters, regardless of whether a patient undergoes endoscopic surveillance, aspirin use in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> appears to be a cost-effective strategy to prevent esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
