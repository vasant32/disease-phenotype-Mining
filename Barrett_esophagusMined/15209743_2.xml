<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this paper were to determine the characteristics of these patients with regard to demography, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, functional status and results of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The charts of the patients treated at our service who underwent esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> for PES between 1971 and 1998 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were performed by means of chi2, Mann-Whitney and Student's t-tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-five patients with PES were dilated by various means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 61.1 +/- 16.3 years, the ratio of men to women was 2.75/1 and mean duration of symptoms was 44.4 +/- 74.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in 100%, pyrosis in 70%, and regurgitation in 40% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an average <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of 3.3 +/- 6 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The upper gastro-intestinal series showed pre- and post-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> diameters at the stricture of 8 +/- 2.5 mm and 15.9 +/- 1.2 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The stricture was located at the lower third of the esophagus in 97% and at the middle third in 3% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found PES endoscopically in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances, with different degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> in 64%, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in 20% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 16% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The biopsy samples showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in 16% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 75.5%, being <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the remaining 8.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Brush cytology was negative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in 100% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Esophageal manometry showed peristaltic wave amplitude of 40 +/- 3 mmHg and presence of peristaltic waves of 62 +/- 38.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LES pressure was 8.6 +/- 6.3 mmHg (NV 24.2 +/- 6.3 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Measurement of pH showed 15% of patients had pH &lt; 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients needed a mean of 4.7 +/- 1.6 dilations per case, with successful results in 87.2% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rate was 0.1% of the total number of procedures and 0.7%, of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 0.7% (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We observed PES relapse in 32% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between relapse, age, duration of the stenosis or pharmacological treatment with H2 blockers or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in Argentina, demography, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, functional status and results of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of PES patients are similar to those reported in the Western world, with the exception of the different behavior seen after treatment with H2 blockers or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
