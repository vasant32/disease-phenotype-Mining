<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression has been observed in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC) in Western countries, and COX-2 inhibitors have been considered as potential chemopreventive agents for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since chemoprevention often targets the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> in high-risk population, it is worthwhile to study COX-2 expression in a spectrum of premalignant and malignant lesions obtained from the high-risk populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, biopsy samples were taken from 240 subjects identified by screening of the high-risk population in Cixian, China, including 27 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 29 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_149'>squamous hyperplasia</z:mpath>, 84 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (31 low grade and 53 high grade), 30 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ, and 70 with invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (60 <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> and 10 AC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison, tissue samples were also collected from He Lon Jiang Province, a low-risk population in China, including 10 patients with invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>, 20 patients with AC, and 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The COX-2 protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using 10% staining as a threshold, 9 of 10 (90%) invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> from low-risk population were COX-2 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no positive COX-2 staining was seen on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, hyperplastic, dysplastic, and in situ squamous lesions from the high-risk population, and only 4 of 60 (6%) invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> exhibited positive COX-2 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For glandular lesions, 6 of 10 (60%) AC from high-risk area and 15 of 20 (75%) from low-risk area showed positive COX-2 staining, and 12 of 17 (70%) premalignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were also positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that COX-2 expression various in squamous lesions from high- and low-risk areas, but not in glandular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed to fully explore the mechanisms that are associated with the different COX-2 immunohistochemical staining patterns in esophageal squamous lesions from low- and high-risk populations </plain></SENT>
