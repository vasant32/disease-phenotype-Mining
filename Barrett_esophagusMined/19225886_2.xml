<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin (HE) staining may fail to show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in BE, and <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-Alcian Blue may present difficulties of interpretation due to its more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence indicates that expression of resistin-like molecule beta (RELMbeta), a goblet cell-specific protein, is uniquely restricted to intestinal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it still remains largely unknown whether RELMbeta can be served as a biomarker for metaplastic epithelium of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, 104 biopsy specimens of the distal esophagus from 88 suspected BE patients were collected, including 56 suspected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, 26 gastric type mucosa, and 22 squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the RELMbeta expression in these biopsy specimens, and compared with those of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 immunostaining and <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-Alcian Blue staining (pH 2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the suspected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> specimens, 46 presented intestinal-type goblet cells and were immunostaining positive for RELMbeta and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2, the remaining ten possessed only goblet cell mimickers and were not reactive with RELMbeta and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the gastric-type mucosa specimens, none reacted with either RELMbeta or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the squamous epithelium was not reactive with RELMbeta and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Acid mucin was present in goblet cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of BE and columnar cells in ten gastric specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the reactivity of RELMbeta was enhanced in six BE specimens with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence that RELMbeta protein may be a novel biomarker to distinguish the intestinal-type goblet cells and goblet cell mimickers, and useful in the correct diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
