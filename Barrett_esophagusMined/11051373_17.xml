<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cost-effective strategies for identifying patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who are most likely to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> have not been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surveillance endoscopy is currently used, and we hypothesized that more frequent surveillance intervals would identify patients with "transient positive" diagnoses of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>--<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> found on one examination but not on subsequent ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to explore the potential economic impact of transient positive diagnoses of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on alternative surveillance strategies over a 10-yr period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were derived from a 2-yr randomized, prospective study comparing <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> in 95 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A transient positive diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was defined as a patient who was diagnosed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> during the study period but whose 24-month biopsies revealed no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We calculated the number of transient positive diagnoses of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and modeled the potential economic impact of a diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> over a 10-yr period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients (31%) had at least one reading of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (20%) had a transient positive diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the study period, no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A surveillance strategy of every other year and every 6 months for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> would result in 1072 endoscopies over a 10-yr period at a discounted cost of $1,587,184 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 61% of endoscopies would be because of transient positive diagnoses of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A strategy of yearly surveillance and every 6 months for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> would result in 1404 endoscopies at a discounted cost of $2,096,733, of which 28% would result from transient positive diagnoses of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The discounted incremental costs of more frequent surveillance in this cohort of patients over 10 yr is $509,549 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on current practice strategies, transient positive diagnoses of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> account for 28-61% of endoscopies in Barrett's surveillance programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This analysis suggests that the endoscopy workload and costs associated with surveillance could be substantially reduced if patients with transient positive diagnoses of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> reverted to usual surveillance after two negative examinations </plain></SENT>
