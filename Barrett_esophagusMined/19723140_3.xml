<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to clarify the differences in molecular pathology between specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO), cardiac (CIM) and gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (GIM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight SIM cases with BO, 30 CIM cases and 52 GIM cases in patients with or without Helicobacter pylori infectionwere analysed for genetic instability and Das-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability and a loss of heterozygosity were evaluated at five microsatellite loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of genetic instability was 55.7% in SIM, 40.0% in CIM and 23.1% in GIM, revealing a significant difference between SIM and GIM (P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each microsatellite marker analysed, there were obvious differences in frequency among the three conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Das-1 reactivity was significantly higher in SIM than in CIM or GIM (P &lt; 0.0001, both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, both genetic instability and Das-1 reactivity in SIM showed a significantly higher incidence in patients with H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> than in those without (P &lt; 0.005 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SIM is distinct from CIM and GIM, and the pathogenesis of SIM, like that of GIM, is associated to some degree with H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
