<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the current study were to evaluate a selected group of patients referred to our Department of General Surgery for presurgical examination (N = 70: 41 males and 29 females) for their expectations about laparoscopic antireflux surgery and to compare these expectations with the official medical treatment goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The leading expectations for laparoscopic antireflux surgery were as follows: (1) for 92.8%, abatement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-related symptoms, especially heartburn, regurgitation, and pain; (2) for 84.3%, a return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> daily activities and life such as eating and drinking habits, sleeping habits, or work-related aspects; (3) for 72.9%, an improvement in quality of life; (4) for 52.9%, a successful surgical intervention without any complications or side effects; and (5) for 48.6%, protection from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only two patients answered that they would expect normalization of pH values and healing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data show that the majority of patients have clear expectations about laparoscopic antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These expectations are partly related to official medical treatment goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, patient-related aspects of outcome concerning expectations should be included as a standard in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> official goals of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> treatment and also in medical outcome studies </plain></SENT>
