<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> plays an important role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE)-associated esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoke has been demonstrated to exacerbate the effects of reflux and thus the initial stages of EAC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, no in vivo studies have been conducted to look at the concomitant effects of cigarette smoke and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> on EAC incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this pilot study, rats that underwent esophagoduodenal anastomosis (EDA) surgery to induce reflux were exposed to whole-body cigarette smoke 3 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Smoke exposure (135 mg/m³/day) was done for 4 h/day for 5 consecutive days and animals were euthanized after a 48-h recovery period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure to EDA-smoke accelerated the development of BE when compared to EDA-air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of reflux caused a significant 3.5-fold increase in nuclear factor-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) staining (1.47 ± 0.6; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals with both reflux and smoking had the highest (10-fold; 4 ± 0.9) induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was a 10-fold increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="1784">4-aminobiphenyl</z:chebi> (4-ABP) protein adducts identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> smoke-exposed animals (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoke aggravates reflux-induced BE and potentially accelerates the progression of BE to EAC through the loss of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (MnSOD), and overexpression of NF-κB- and COX-2-mediated factors </plain></SENT>
