<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main aims of the study were to assess the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in a cohort of patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and the relationship between endoscopic and histologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 14,898 consecutive patients, and found 251 (1.7%) had endoscopic findings consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (grade 2 to 4 according to Savary) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On histological examination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was confirmed in 111 of 251 patients (44.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The crude prevalence rate of BE, based on histology, was 7.4/1,000, and was 2.6-fold higher in males than in females (c.i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1.7-4.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> proved to be 25-fold more frequent among patients who complained of heartburn (80.1/1,000) than among the others (3.2/1,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specialized columnar epithelium was identified in 69 of 111 cases (62.2%) and the proportionate distribution of the histological subtypes was similar in males and in females (chi-square Idf = 0.20, p = n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was detected in 7 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had specialized columnar epithelium (6 low grade and 1 high grade) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we believe that our rate of 7.4/1,000 approaches the true prevalence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, as it is based on our study of unselected patients presenting for initial evaluation of a variety of UGI symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in specialized columnar epithelium suggests that patients with this subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may be at increased risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and might, therefore, benefit most from surveillance </plain></SENT>
