<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to determine whether RANK is expressed in oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) and its precursor, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sections of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from 23 oesophagectomy specimens showing EA and variable degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BM were immunohistochemically stained for RANK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 23 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (100%) showed strong RANK immunoreactivity in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 8 cases with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), RANK immunoreactivity was weaker and detected in a smaller percentage of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RANK was not detected in any area of BM that was negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND) (17 cases), or showed low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) (9 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that RANK is expressed as a late event during malignant progression in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies are needed to determine whether interfering with RANK signalling affects the survival of EA cells </plain></SENT>
