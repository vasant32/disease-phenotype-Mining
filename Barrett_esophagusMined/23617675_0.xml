<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 40-year-old man was referred to our hospital for detailed examination of a protuberant lesion in long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (LSBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under white light endoscopy (WLE) the lesion appeared as a protuberant lesion with a rough surface and was diagnosed as 0-IIa-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suspected to be a well-differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A regular villous pattern was shown in the background mucosa of the LSBE by narrow-band imaging (NBI) magnifying endoscopy (NBI-ME) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a slightly irregular villous pattern was observed on the lateral side of the main lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a 0-IIa-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was estimated to have a flatly lateral extension component (i.e. 0-IIb spreading) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 0-IIb spreading was unclear when using WLE, but could be diagnosed by NBI-ME based on the surface pattern differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Markings were placed outside the edge of the flatly lateral extension, and endoscopic submucosal dissection was carried out.The pathological diagnosis of the protuberant lesion with flatly lateral spreading was well-differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The macroscopic type was 0-IIa+IIb, 45 Ã— 43 mm in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The invasion depth was T1a (deep muscularis mucosae) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lymphatic and venous invasions were negative; horizontal and vertical margins were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, NBI-ME was useful for the diagnosis of the flatly lateral extension of this 0-IIa+IIb esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigations with many cases are necessary </plain></SENT>
