<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To clarify the distribution and significance of the oesophageal and gastric cardiac mucosae at the oesophago-gastric junction (EGJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Oesophagectomy specimens from 131 consecutive patients with middle and upper thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surgically resected specimens including the EGJ were cut into 5 mm thick serial sections and examined histopathologically for the length of the oesophageal and gastric cardiac mucosae and the incidence of columnar epithelial islands (CEIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also determined the presence of short-segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (SSBE) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath> in SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oesophageal cardiac mucosa was found in 125 cases (95%) and gastric cardiac mucosa was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean length of the oesophageal and gastric cardiac mucosa was 4 mm (range 1-26 mm) and 13 mm (range 2-64 mm), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CEIs were found in 75 cases (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SSBE was found in 70 cases (53%), among which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath> was found in 28 cases (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No long-segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean length of oesophageal cardiac mucosa (6 mm) and gastric cardiac mucosa (17 mm) in SSBE was significantly greater than that (3 mm and 8 mm, respectively) in non-SSBE cases (P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence (69%) of CEIs in SSBE was significantly higher than that (44%) in non-SSBE cases (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oesophageal and gastric cardiac mucosae were found frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Oesophageal cardiac glands and CEIs might play an important role in the development of SSBE </plain></SENT>
