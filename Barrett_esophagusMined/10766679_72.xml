<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The increased risk for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> associated with long-segment (&gt; or =3 cm) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> is well recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that short-segment (&lt;3 cm) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> is substantially more common; however, the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in patients with this disorder is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between segment length and risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University medical center in Seattle, Washington </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 309 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Patients were monitored for progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> by repeated endoscopy with biopsy for an average of 3.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to calculate adjusted relative risks and 95% <z:chebi fb="193" ids="17996">Cls </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for histologic diagnosis at study entry, segment length was not related to risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the full cohort (P &gt; 0.2 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at baseline were excluded, however, a nonsignificant trend was observed; based on a linear model, a 5-cm difference in segment length was associated with a 1.7-fold (95% CI, 0.8-fold to 3.8-fold) increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eligible patients, a 5-cm difference in segment length was associated with a small increase in the risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (relative risk, 1.4 [CI, 1.0 to 2.1]; P = 0.06 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A similar trend was observed among patients without high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> was not substantially lower than that in patients with longer segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although our results suggest a small increase in risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> with increasing segment length, additional follow-up is needed to determine whether the patterns of risk occurred by chance or represent true differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Until more data are available, the frequency of endoscopic surveillance should be selected without regard to segment length </plain></SENT>
