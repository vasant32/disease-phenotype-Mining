<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: To perform long-term histopathological and clinical assessment of patients who have previously undergone cardiomyotomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: There are few studies on long-term outcome for patients treated by cardiomyotomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent publications suggest that these patients may be at high risk of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients, in whom at least 5 years had elapsed since laparoscopic cardiomyotomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo>, were identified from a prospective database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were invited to attend for endoscopy and clinical outcome was assessed by questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Out of 171 patients identified, 2 had died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the remainder, 68 were recruited [mean age 52 years (range 26-72)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six percent reported minimal symptoms and 6% experienced frequent reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (93%) reported some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> scores remained significantly lower than preoperatively (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was comparable to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, and 97% of patients indicated they had made the correct decision to undergo surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At endoscopy 83% had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the distal esophagus on histopathology, including 22% with moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and 7% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0239295" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal candidiasis</z:e>, and 2 had eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: The clinical outcome remains excellent in most patients at long-term follow-up after cardiomyotomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Surveillance endoscopy might identify high-risk patients but routine endoscopy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients is probably not necessary, particularly early after surgery </plain></SENT>
