<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used confocal fluorescence microscopy for ex vivo comparison of autofluorescence in non-dysplastic and dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unstained frozen sections were obtained from snap-frozen <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> biopsy samples and scanned with confocal fluorescence microscopy (458 nm excitation; 505-550 nm [green] and &gt; 560 nm [red] emission) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Digital micrographs were taken from areas with homogenous and specific histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual inspection and statistical analysis were used to evaluate the image datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic and non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> epithelia fluoresced mainly in the green spectrum and the main sources of autofluorescence were the cytoplasm and lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was differentiated from non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> by microstructural tissue changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there were no specific changes in either the locations or average intensities of intrinsic green and red autofluorescence at the epithelial level that could differentiate between dysplastic and non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> epithelia, ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detectable differences in autofluorescence between BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in vivo are probably not caused by specific changes in epithelial fluorophores but are likely due to other inherent changes (e.g. mucosal thickening and increased microvascularity) attenuating autofluorescence from the collagen-rich submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, confocal fluorescence microscopy provides 'histology-like' imaging of Barrett's tissues and may offer a unique opportunity to exploit microstructural tissue changes occurring during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> for in vivo detection of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's patients using newly developed confocal fluorescence microendoscopy devices </plain></SENT>
