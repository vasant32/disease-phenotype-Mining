<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and five biopsies of heterotopic columnar epithelium were stained for H&amp;E, <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>/Alcian Blue and HID/Alcian Blue for the routine histology and neutral/acidic sialo- and sulphomucin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other sections were silver impregnated by the Grimelius technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical techniques were applied for the assessment of the accumulation of p53 protein, "S" phase of the replication cell cycle using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), marked for cell differentiation and proliferation using EGF and TGFa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>105 cases of heterotopic columnar epithelium consisted of 74 cases of BO, 25 junctional and 7 corpus mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic BO (n = 9) showed similar amount of sulphomucin and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cell number when compared to non-dysplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCNA study revealed a close similarity between dysplastic, indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and non-dysplastic, mucosal positive counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Growth factors activity was significantly higher in dysplastic and indefinite than in non-dysplastic, but no such difference was found between dysplastic and indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant concurrent p53 expression in dysplastic and indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the practical utility of mucin stainings, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cell count, assessment of cell proliferation and differentiation by PCNA, EGF and TGFa seems to be limited in differentiation of the dysplastic and indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Altered expression of p53, particularly in combination with EGF and TGFa, may be useful in studying these lesions </plain></SENT>
