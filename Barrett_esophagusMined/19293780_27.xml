<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The mucosa of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> recognized on endoscopy usually shows epithelium with and without goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Columnar epithelium with goblet cells ("<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>") is generally believed to represent a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> and has been shown to contain DNA abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the biological properties of non-goblet columnar epithelium remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the DNA content properties of non-goblet epithelium in patients with metaplastic columnar epithelium of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mucosal biopsies of the esophagus from 68 patients with columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus (22 without goblet cells and 46 with goblet cells) and 19 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa (controls) were histologically evaluated for the density of goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter group was divided into low-density, high-density, and very high-density goblet cell subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections of non-goblet epithelium and goblet cell epithelium (where present) were evaluated by image cytometry, and high-fidelity DNA histograms were created to indicate the G0/G1 peak DNA index (DI), DNA content <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> index (HI), and the percentage of cells with DNA exceeding 5N (5N-EC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>G0/G1 peaks with DI&gt;1.1 were considered aneuploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> gastric controls showed a mean peak DI of 1.02+/-0.03 and an HI of 11.6+/-0.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the controls revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> or 5N-EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with metaplastic columnar epithelium with goblet cells showed a DI of 1.15+/-0.12, HI of 18.2+/-2.1, mild <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in 54% of the cases, and 5N-EC in 15% of the cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were significantly higher than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with metaplastic columnar epithelium without goblet cells showed DNA content results statistically similar to those of patients with metaplastic columnar epithelium with goblet cells, and also revealed significantly higher values compared with those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were no significant differences in any of the key DNA content abnormalities between non-goblet and goblet cell-containing epithelium in patients with metaplastic columnar epithelium with goblet cells, or between these two types of epithelium according to the density of goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DNA content abnormalities occur with equal frequency and extent in metaplastic columnar epithelium of the esophagus without goblet cells compared with metaplastic columnar epithelium with goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that metaplastic non-goblet columnar epithelium of the esophagus may have neoplastic potential </plain></SENT>
