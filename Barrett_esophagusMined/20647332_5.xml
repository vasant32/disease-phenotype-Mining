<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We asked whether there might be common genomic alterations that could be identified as potential clinical biomarker(s) for BE by whole genome profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We detected copy number alterations and/or loss of heterozygosity at 56 fragile sites in 20 patients with premalignant BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal fragile sites are particularly sensitive to DNA breaks and are frequent sites of rearrangement or loss in many human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genomic alterations detected by array-CGH were associated with fragile sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Copy number losses in early BE were observed at particularly high frequency at FRA3B (81%), FRA9A/C (71.4%), FRA5E (52.4%), and FRA 4D (52.4%), and at lower frequencies in other fragile sites, including FRA1K (42.9%), FRAXC (42.9%), FRA 12B (33.3%), and FRA16D (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Due to the consistency of the region of copy number loss, we were able to verify these results by quantitative PCR, which detected the loss of FRA3B and FRA16D, in 83% and 40% of early molecular stage BE patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss of heterozygosity in these cases was confirmed through pyrosequencing at FRA3B and FRA16D (75% and 70%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deletion and genomic instability at FRA3B and other fragile sites could thus be a biomarker of genetic damage in BE patients and a potential biomarker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
