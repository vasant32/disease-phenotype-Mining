<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess whether the circadian pattern of gastric acidity differs between refluxer patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Continuous 24-hr gastric pH monitoring was performed in 119 healthy volunteers, 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 37 patients with moderate and 10 patients with severe reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these diseases the final diagnosis was ascertained by means of endoscopy plus biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the 24-hr and daytime patterns of gastric pH between healthy subjects and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, while nocturnal acidity was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) in the latter population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gastric acidity, in contrast, was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in controls than in patients with both moderate and severe reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> during the whole 24-hr period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between refluxer patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in any of the three time intervals we analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects had lower gastric pH than patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> during the night and than patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> during the whole 24-hr period, gastric hyperacidity is not a relevant factor in the development of both metaplastic columnar epithelium and inflammatory changes in the distal esophagus, and other pathophysiological mechanisms are involved in these histological alterations </plain></SENT>
