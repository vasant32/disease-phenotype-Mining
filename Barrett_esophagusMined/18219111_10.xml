<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive research the exact molecular basis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we evaluated the transcriptome of EA in comparison to non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), the metaplastic epithelium that predisposes for EA, and compared the transcriptome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For obtaining the transcriptomes tissue biopsies were used and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Validation of results by RT-PCR and immunoblotting was performed using tissues of an additional 23 EA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over 58,000 tags were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between EA and BE 1013, and between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium 1235 tags were significantly differentially expressed (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most up-regulated genes in EA compared to BE were SRY-box 4 and Lipocalin2, whereas the most down-regulated genes in EA were Trefoil factors and Annexin A10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most up-regulated genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium were BMP4, E-Cadherin and TFF3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results could suggest that the BE expression profile is closer related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus then to EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, several uniquely expressed genes are identified </plain></SENT>
