<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is an important risk factor for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC), and elevated serum leptin is characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that leptin may have biological effects in promoting esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and examined the effects of leptin on the OE33 Barrett's-derived EAC line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proliferation was assessed by dimethylthiazoldiphenyltetra-zoliumbromide and 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assays and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by ELISA of intracellular nucleosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracellular signaling was examined using specific pharmacological inhibitors and direct detection of phosphorylated active kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of the long and short leptin receptors by OE33 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leptin stimulated OE33 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects were dependent on cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and replicated by adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> and leptin were abolished by the EP-4 antagonist AH23848 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ERK, p38 MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt, and Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)-2 were activated upstream of COX-2 induction, whereas the epidermal growth factor receptor and c-Jun <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal kinase (JNK) were downstream of COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The activation of ERK and Akt but not p38 MAPK was JAK2 dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> stimulated phosphorylation of JNK in an EGF receptor-dependent manner, and activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor required protein kinase C, src, and matrix metalloproteinase activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that leptin stimulates cell proliferation and inhibits <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in OAC cells via ERK, p38 MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt, and JAK2-dependent activation of COX-2 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subsequent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>-mediated transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and JNK activation are essential to the leptin effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These effects may contribute to the greatly increased risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
