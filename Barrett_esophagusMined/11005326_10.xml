<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the value of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty patients with dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> (ALA) 30 mg/kg orally followed 4 h later by laser endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up endoscopy and biopsies were performed at 1, 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A macroscopic response was seen in 33 out of 40 patients, with a median decrease in columnar epithelial area of 30% (range 0-90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment biopsies showed no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 39 out of 40 patients, with LGD remaining in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was maintained at 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that ALA-induced <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> provides safe and effective ablation therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and is particularly useful against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
