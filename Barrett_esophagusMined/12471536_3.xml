<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new angled swing-jaw forceps has become available which is said to facilitate tangential oesophageal biopsy sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the size and quality of oesophageal biopsies obtained with the forceps of angled design in comparison with the large cup disposable forceps and the conventional reusable upper gastrointestinal forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective comparative study, three biopsies were taken at each of three levels, using a different design of forceps at each level, in each of 48 patients undergoing endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The order in which the forceps were used was randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A pathologist assessed the size and quality of each set of biopsies obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean biopsy diameter was significantly greater at 3.00 mm with the angled forceps (P &lt; 0.01), in comparison with 2.52 mm with the elliptical forceps and 2.07 mm with the conventional forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fewer biopsies obtained with the angled forceps were graded as inadequate (8.3 %) compared with those obtained using the disposable large cup and conventional forceps (25 % and 22.9 %, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The design of forceps used influences the size and quality of tissue obtained during endoscopic surveillance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The angled swing-jaw forceps are recommended as the most suitable for this purpose </plain></SENT>
