<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIM: The inlet patch is an area of heterotopic gastric mucosa found in the proximal esophagus at the level of the upper esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited data are available regarding this form of <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> and its incidence, significance, and possible association with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our observations of such <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasias</z:mp> in patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> referred for photodynamic therapy were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were prospectively evaluated endoscopically for the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> of the proximal esophagus (salmon-colored area of a least 5 mm in diameter with cardia-type <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> on biopsy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were included in this study: 11 patients with dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (8 males, mean age 79 years) and 25 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients (18 males, mean age 71 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At endoscopy prior to photodynamic therapy, 11 patients (31%; 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 3 dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) were noted to have an area of gastric mucosa in the proximal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each patient, there was at least 5 cm of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa between <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> and distal esophageal pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this selected group of patients with high-grade dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> referred for photodynamic therapy, <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> of the proximal esophagus was found in nearly one third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are under way to test more widely for this association and to determine whether this is a marker of disease severity and the result of similar pathogenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
