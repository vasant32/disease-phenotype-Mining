<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has been identified as the most important risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BE has been categorized as long-segment (LSBE) if it extends 3 cm or more up the esophagus and as short-segment (SSBE) if it extends less than 3 cm into esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> may also develop in gastric mucosa (IMG) at the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IMG has a much lower risk to progress to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> when compared with SLBE or SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these conditions are difficult to distinguish one from another only based on endoscopic and morphologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore the aim this study was to evaluate the cytokeratin (CK) 7 and 20 inmunoreactivity patterns in these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasias</z:mpath> with the purpose to determine the precise anatomic site of the biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens from 14 patients with LSBE, 6 with SSBE and 7 patients with IMG were inmunohistochemically stained with monoclonal antibodies to CK 7 and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Barrett's CK7/20 pattern was characterized by superficial and deep CK7 reactivity and only superficial CK 20 staining in the intestinalized mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This pattern was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 (100%) patients with LSBE, and was absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 patients with IMG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsy specimens from patients with IMG showed no staining for CK7 and diffuse surface positivity for CK20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>67% of the biopsy specimens from patients with endoscopic SSBE showed Barrett's CK7/20 pattern, and the remaining 33% specimens showed the IMG staining pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on our data the inmunohistochemical determination of CK7/20 is an excelent tool with high specificity in distinguishing LSBE and SSBE from IMG </plain></SENT>
