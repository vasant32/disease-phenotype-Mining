<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: The endoscopic landmark of esophagogastric junction (EGJ) for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) differs between Japan and Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Japanese endoscopists use the distal end of the lower esophageal palisade vessels to localize EGJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the West, endoscopists use the proximal gastric folds because of concerns that palisade vessels may be difficult to recognize </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether there were differences between American and Japanese endoscopists in the recognition of palisade vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 82 patients were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were referred for diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoendoscopy (EGD) at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, from May to July 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>American and Japanese endoscopists evaluated the EGJ of patients undergoing diagnostic EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the differences in the recognition of the distal end of palisade vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We calculated the kappa statistic to measure interobserver variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on localization using the distal end of the palisade vessels, American and Japanese endoscopists identified the EGJ in 87.8% (72/82) and 89.0% (73/82) of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The kappa statistic for visualization of EGJ was 0.88 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73-1.00] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: American and Japanese endoscopists similarly recognized the distal end of palisade vessels as EGJ </plain></SENT>
