<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The etiology and significance of cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CIM) is disputed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CIM may represent a form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> due to reflux or could reflect generalized gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> due to Helicobacter pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to utilize gene expression data to compare CIM to Barrett's and gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic biopsies were classified by endoscopic and histologic criteria as CIM (n= 33), Barrett's (n= 25), or gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the antrum or body (n= 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The squamocolumnar and gastroesophageal junctions were aligned in CIM patients and patients with diffuse gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>H. pylori was tested for in the biopsies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After laser-capture microdissection, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of a panel of nine genes that has been shown to differentiate Barrett's from other foregut mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis with linear discriminant analysis of the expression data was used to classify each sample into groups based solely on similarity of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis was performed for three groups (CIM vs. Barrett's vs. gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) and two groups (CIM + Barrett's vs. gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> among groups (P= 0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clustering into three groups resulted in frequent misclassification between CIM and Barrett's while misclassification of gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CIM and Barrett's groups were then combined for two group clustering and linear discriminant analysis correctly predicted 95% of CIM and Barrett's samples and 83% of gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> samples based on gene expression alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the gene expression profiles of CIM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were similar in 95% of biopsies and differed significantly from that of gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The indistinguishable gene expression profile of CIM and BE suggests that they may share a common etiology in the majority of patients with a similar biology, and calls into question the perception that CIM is an innocuous process </plain></SENT>
