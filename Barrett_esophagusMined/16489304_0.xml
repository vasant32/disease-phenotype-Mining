<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The possible progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is well established: the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in BE is about 1.9-10% or 1/52-1/441 patients/year with a risk up to 30-125 times the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance can detect esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> when they are early and curable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of endoscopic and histologic surveillance in patients with BE is to follow its evolution in order to characterize possible affiliation to a neoplastic risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1998 to 2000 we have endoscopically identified 12 patients with EB, histologically confirmed: 9 males and 3 females, with a M/F ratio of 3:1 and an average of 45.25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the endoscopic and histologic follow-up have observed the sequence from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with a low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in one patient, confirmed after 2 months of treatment with double-dose pump inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>), to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with a high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy samples done after vital staining with Lugol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>So the patient had an endoscopic mucosal ablation, because he rejected esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, we used prokinetic drugs and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> and we involved them in a follow-up every 2/3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Histological grading of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is currently the most important parameter used to follow-up patients with EB: the guidelines suggest a periodic endoscopic surveillance, from six months to 2 or 5 years, according to higher or lower risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> arising, because there is no medical or surgical therapy able to decrease <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
