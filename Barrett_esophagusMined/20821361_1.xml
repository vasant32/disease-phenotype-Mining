<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brush cytology has been proposed as a simple inexpensive component of endoscopic surveillance, which may also detect abnormalities prior to detection of histologic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to determine whether brush cytology provides any additional value over endoscopic surveillance biopsies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This retrospective cohort study included 530 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> undergoing endoscopic surveillance with paired biopsy and cytology specimens at the Cleveland Clinic between January 1994 and July 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, and concordance rates of cytology and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sensitivity of cytology for any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 49 % and specificity was 95 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, sensitivity was 82 % for detection of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> but only 31 % for low grade/indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concordance rate between cytology and histology was 80 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histology had a higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection rate than cytology (24.0 % vs. 15.7 %, respectively; P &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cytology has excellent specificity and good sensitivity for the detection of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> but poor sensitivity for low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was substantial concordance between cytology and histology for the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, histology had a higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection rate and therefore the value of routine cytology in the surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is questionable </plain></SENT>
