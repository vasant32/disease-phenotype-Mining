<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether HMGI(Y) expression is associated with malignant progression in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase staining for HMGI(Y) was performed on sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded endoscopic esophageal biopsies from 42 patients with BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These consisted of 19 biopsies negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND), 16 with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD)/indeterminate for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (IND), and 7 with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD)/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of positive cells was recorded, and nuclear HMGI(Y) immunoreactivity in &gt;10% of the cells was considered positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive HMGI(Y) staining was detected in 2 of 19 (11%) cases ND, 5 of 16 (30%) LGD/IND cases, and 7 of 7 (100%) HGD/CA cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopsies with HGD/CA were significantly more likely to be positive for HMGI(Y) than biopsies ND (P &lt; 0.0001) or with LGD/IND (P = 0.0046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that HMGI(Y) expression is significantly associated with malignant progression in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed to determine whether BM biopsies that are ND or LGD/IND and positive for HMGI(Y) are more likely to progress to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
