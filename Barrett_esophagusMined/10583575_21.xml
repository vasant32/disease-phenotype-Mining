<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study investigated the pattern of expression of MUC1 and MUC2 mucin gene products in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> as possible indicators of increased malignant potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue sections from 51 patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, nine with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (three indefinite) and 28 resected <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were stained with monoclonal antibodies to MUC1 and MUC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients were men (70/88, 80%) who were treated over a period of 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were under surveillance at the time of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 51 biopsies with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> expressed MUC2 and MUC1 was consistently absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither MUC1 or MUC2 were expressed in the dysplastic epithelium whether in its pure form (6/6) or when associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (26/28) (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three biopsies which were initially classified as high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> expressed MUC1 and these turned out to be <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> on further investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MUC1 was also expressed in 12/28 (43%) of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and majority of these were poorly differentiated stage 3 tumours (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MUC2 was only positive in mucin-secreting <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (4/28; 14%) irrespective of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite the large number of patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, very few patients presented with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, implying that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is a silent disease in the community presenting late as <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study has demonstrated aberrant expression of MUC2 (an intestinal mucin) in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and this expression is lost when the cells become dysplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The lack of MUC1 in dysplastic epithelium and its expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> could be utilized as a marker which could differentiate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in mucosal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, expression of MUC1 in advanced stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancers</z:e> (as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>) suggests an unfavourable prognosis </plain></SENT>
