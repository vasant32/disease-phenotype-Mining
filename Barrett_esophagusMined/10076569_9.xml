<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase (GST), a family of detoxification enzymes consisting of class alpha, mu, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e>, and theta isoforms, is involved in detoxification of carcinogens and low levels of these enzymes correlated with high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now compared GST enzyme activity, GST isoenzyme composition and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) content of Barrett's mucosa with that of adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens of 98 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were taken from both Barrett's and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GST enzyme activity towards <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene</z:chebi> was measured, and GST isoenzyme levels were determined by densitometrical analyses of western blots after immunodetection with monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total GSH content was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography after conjugation with monobromobimane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Wilcoxon's signed rank test and Spearman correlation analyses were used for statistical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As compared with adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium, GST enzyme activity in Barrett's epithelium was reduced by 35%, and GST mu, GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> and GSH levels were reduced by 24%, 30%, and 63%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the minor GST alpha and GST theta levels were higher in Barrett's epithelium (by 625% and 33%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High levels of GSH and GSTs in general are correlated with protection against cellular or cytogenetic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observed reduction in GSTs and GSH in Barrett's epithelium may therefore contribute to the increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in this tissue </plain></SENT>
