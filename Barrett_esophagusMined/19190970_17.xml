<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> using <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) is usually followed by the formation of a neosquamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Investigating simple columnar or stratified squamous epithelium associated cytokeratin and microRNA (miRNA) expression in neo-squamous epithelium could help determine the identity and stability of the neosquamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients underwent ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were collected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> mucosa and proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium before ablation, and from neosquamous and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional esophageal mucosal biopsies from ten nonrefluxing subjects were used as a reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expression of the cytokeratins CK-8 and CK-14 and the microRNAs miR-143 and miR-205 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CK-8 and miR-143 expression were significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> mucosa, compared to neosquamous and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium before and after APC, whereas miRNA-205 and CK-14 expression was significantly lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> mucosa compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> categories of squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of CK-8, CK-14, miR-205, and miR-143 was similar between neosquamous epithelium compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only miR-143 expression was significantly higher in neosquamous and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium before and after APC compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium from control subjects (p &lt; 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The expression levels of cytokeratins and miRNAs studied in post-ablation neosquamous epithelium and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, miR-143 expression is still elevated in both neosquamous mucosa, and the squamous mucosa above the metaplastic segment, suggesting that this mucosa may not be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; i.e., it is different to that seen in subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>miR-143 could promote a Barrett's epithelium gene expression pattern, and this could have a role in development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
