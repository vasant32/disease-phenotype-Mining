<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To evaluate the importance of the length of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e>, sex, age, smoking, and drinking habits as risk factors for malignant degeneration, the authors performed a retrospective case-control study comparing patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 96 patients (53 male and 43 female; mean age, 61 years) with a benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> and 62 patients (47 male and 15 female; mean age, 62 years) with an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> referred to the Rotterdam <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Esophageal Tumor</z:e> Study Group, diagnosed over the same period (1978-1985), were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A frequency distribution of the length of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> in both groups was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with multivariate methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The length of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> was related significantly to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>: a doubling of the length resulted in a 1.7 times increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Smokers had a 2.3-fold increased risk as compared with nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male sex as a risk factor approached statistical significance (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjusted for these risk factors, no relation between <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and age or alcohol consumption was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of development of an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> increased with the length of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1258085" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barrett epithelium</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Smoking and possibly male sex were also risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The identification of these risk factors may help in developing more efficient screening programs for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
