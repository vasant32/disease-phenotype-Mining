<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No prospective data about the distribution of macroscopic types and their location in early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> are available, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to evaluate the clinical applicability of this macroscopic classification and to analyze the relative proportions of the different gross types in early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and the correlation between the macroscopic classification and the stage or grade of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 344 patients with 380 Barrett's neoplastic lesions who were referred between October 1996 and September 2005 for endoscopic therapy of early Barrett's high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were prospectively included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Routine endoscopy prior to endoscopic resection in our center included assessment of the macroscopic type (according to the Japanese classification) and documentation of the radial location of the neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Images were recorded which were later assessed by six independent reviewers; intra- and interobserver agreement for the assessment of the macroscopic type were calculated using kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of the lesions by gross type was as follows: type I, n = 49 (13 %); type IIa, n = 139 (37 %); type IIb, n = 106 (28 %); type IIc, n = 17 (4 %); type IIa + c, n = 62 (16 %); type III, n = 7 (2 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type IIb lesions seem to be the most favorable type with regard to differentiation and T category ( P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean kappa value for the interobserver agreement was 0.86 and the mean kappa value for the intraobserver agreement was 0.89 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most lesions were found at the 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of the macroscopic type may provide important information about the possibility of endoscopic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The harder-to-detect flat lesions are by far the most frequent macroscopic type of neoplastic lesion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
