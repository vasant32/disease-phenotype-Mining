<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to compare the appropriateness of indications for diagnostic UGE between general practitioners and gastroenterologists in open-access endoscopy units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: General practitioners were previously updated on the main indications, risks and benefits for UGE, and instructions for submitting patients to open-access units were given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The indications for UGE were analysed by means of the ASGE 1997 and EPAGE guidelines for the appropriate use of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between patients referred by general practitioners or gastroenterologists with respect to gender, age, indication of UGE or the presence of alarm symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the ASGE guidelines overuse of UGE was observed in 25 (18.4%) of 136 patients submitted by general practitioners and in 32 (18.6%) of 172 patients submitted by gastroenterologists (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the EPAGE guidelines a non-appropriated UGE was present in 16 (11.8%) of patients referred by general practitioners and by 19 (11%) of patients submitted by gastroenterologists (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The level of appropriateness for UGE indication obtained by general practitioners is similar to that reached by gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding should be considered for the implementation of open-access endoscopy units in our country </plain></SENT>
