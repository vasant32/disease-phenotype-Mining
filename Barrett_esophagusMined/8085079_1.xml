<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eighty four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in whom endoscopy showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or minimally altered esophageal mucosa (hyperemia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> or mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>) were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each patient, two esophageal biopsies were obtained (1 and 3 cm above the mucosal change zone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was found in 28% of patients with endoscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa and in 26% of patients with minimal endoscopical mucosal alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the description of these minimal esophageal alterations during endoscopy is subjective, unreproducible and do not clearly indicate the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A classification of endoscopical findings is proposed, based on the presence of objective lesions such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
