<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By avoiding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277684" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">animal sacrifice</z:e>, the natural history of this disease can be studied in a longitudinal fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to characterize the endoscopic features of esophageal mucosa at various stages of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence in a rat reflux model of Barrett's for comparison with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> was produced by introducing a side-to-side esophago-gastro-jejunostomy in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic examination of the distal esophagus was performed in 24 surgically altered and 4 control rats, between weeks 24 and 36 after the operation in 4-week intervals, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were biopsied and sacrificed at 36 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic images were classified based on the surface mucosal patterns of the distal esophagus and then compared with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic appearance was classified as: (i) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, characterized by a smooth surface; (ii) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, defined as elevated plaques/ridges, deep grooves, and thin linear folds; (iii) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, indicated by coarse folds/grooves, meshlike villi, and foveolar appearance; and (iv) <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, suggested by irregular-shaped mass lesions with ulcerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic criteria for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> yielded a sensitivity of 100% in comparison with histology </plain></SENT>
