<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex serves as a master switch that directs and limits the execution of specific cellular programs, such as differentiation and growth control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SWI/SNF function requires one of two paralogous ATPase subunits, Brahma (BRM) or BRM-related gene 1 (BRG1), which we previously found are lost together in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although BRG1 has been found to be mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines, the mechanisms underlying BRM silencing are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we sequenced BRM in 10 BRM/BRG1-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines and found that BRM was devoid of abrogating mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors restored BRM expression in each of these BRG1/BRM-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines, indicating that epigenetic silencing is a major mechanism underlying the loss of BRM expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite their ability to restore BRM expression, these HDAC inhibitors also blocked BRM function when present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, after their removal, we observed that BRM expression remained elevated for several days, and during this period, BRM activity was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that the suppression of BRM occurs in a broad range of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types and that loss of one or both BRM alleles potentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, BRG1 and BRM are silenced by different mechanisms, and it may be possible to clinically target and reexpress BRM in a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types, potentially impacting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
