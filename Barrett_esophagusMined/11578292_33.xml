<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> have a risk of approximately 1 per 100 patient-years for the development of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic ablation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> has been shown to lead to the regrowth of a 'neo' squamous epithelium if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> is controlled, but the incidence of subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> formation is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The follow-up of 55 patients who underwent endoscopic ablation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> beam plasma coagulation (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="28971">ABPC</z:chebi>) is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 55 patients, nine had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, nine had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and the remainder had non-dysplastic Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had reflux control by antireflux surgery and the remainder received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was ablated by <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28971">ABPC</z:chebi> to within 2 cm of the gastro-oesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: To date, one patient has died and one patient was unable to complete treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients were followed by regular endoscopic surveillance for a mean of 38.5 months to give a total follow-up of 173.5 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> has developed in any patient during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The absence of malignant complications in this study of prophylactic ablation of long-segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> strengthens the argument for endoscopic ablation in the prevention of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
