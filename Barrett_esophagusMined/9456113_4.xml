<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The rising incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus, as well as its association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, has been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience in treating patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 70 consecutive patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus treated between November 1988 and April 1996 with preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> and resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographics, pathologic features, and survival were compared with patients who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus without Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses was performed using Student's t test, Fisher's exact test, and Kaplan-Meier where appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two (46%) patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the last 4 years, 72% (23 of 32) of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had coexistent Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in patients with or without Barrett's with regard to age, sex, race, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, preoperative chemotherapy, type of operation, or operative stage were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> in patients with Barrett's were larger (p = 0.017), had better differentiation (p = 0.002), and were less likely to have a complete response to preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival, however, was better in the group with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (p = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> appears to be increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may be distinct clinically and biologically from <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus that does not develop in association with Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival was better in our patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
