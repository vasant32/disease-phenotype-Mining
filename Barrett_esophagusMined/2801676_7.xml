<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, LES pressure was considerably lower and percentage exposure to acid was considerably higher than in either patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or controls (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Percentage of time with esophageal pH below 4 was 33.2% in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 14% in patients with slight-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (p less than 0.001), and 3.4% in controls (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, the esophageal exposure to acid was similar in upright and supine positions, and the number of refluxes that lasted longer than 5 min was also greater in these patients than in uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or controls (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, their acid-clearing capacity was markedly reduced (p less than 0.001 vs. control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">Omeprazole</z:chebi> 20 mg, given once daily, reduced both percentage of time with pH below 4 (p less than 0.001) and the number of episodes longer than 5 min (p less than 0.001), but had no effect on acid clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> lowered intragastric acidity by 77.8% (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median intragastric pH was 1.9 (1.7-2.1) pretreatment, and 4.5 (4.2-5) during <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
