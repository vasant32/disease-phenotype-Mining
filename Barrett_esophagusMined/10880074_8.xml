<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Binding of two lectins, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and peanut agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>), in human and rodent colon were previously examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> tissue showed intense WGA binding; <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> binding was minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diseased tissues showed increased <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> binding </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined biorecognition of free and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53440">HPMA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi>-conjugated WGA and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> and anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1406916" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thomsen</z:e>-Friedenreich (TF) antigen antibody binding in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neonatal, adult, and diseased rodent tissues, human specimens of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neonatal WGA binding was comparable to the adult, with additional <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> columnar cell binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> binding was more prevalent; <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> columnar cell binding existed during the first 2.5 weeks of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>WGA binding was strong in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diseased adult tissues; a slight decrease was noted in disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> binding was minimal in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues; increases were seen in disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-TF antigen antibody studies showed that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> did not bind to the antigen </plain></SENT>
