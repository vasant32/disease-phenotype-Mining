<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: This prospective study evaluated the effectiveness of 90 W <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) for the ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) that is considered to be the main risk factor for the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The results from 25 patients, observed at the First Department of General Surgery, University of Verona, Italy, from October 2000 to October 2003, who underwent APC for histologically proven BE were prospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ablation treatment was completed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients but one (96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean number of APC sessions needed to complete ablation was 1.6 (total number: 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The eradication was obtained in the majority of cases by one session only (60%), two sessions were required in 24% of the cases and three or more in 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About 43% of the sessions were complicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retrosternal pain (22.5%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (17.5%) were the most frequent symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one major complication occurred, it was an <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> formation on the treated esophagus that required urgent endoscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The follow-up was accomplished in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with a mean period of 26.3 mo and 20 patients (84%) with a follow-up period longer than 24 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only one patient showed a relapse of metaplastic mucosa 12 mo after the completion of ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient was hence re-treated and now is free from recurrence 33 mo later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High power setting (90 W) APC showed to be safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effects persist at a mean follow-up period of two years with a comparable cost in term of complications with respect to standard power settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies with greater number of patients are required to confirm these results and to assess if ablation reduces the incidence of malignant progression </plain></SENT>
