<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study presents the results of serial cardiac testing following photodynamic therapy for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients were treated using photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> phosphokinase and lactic dehydrogenase isoenzyme levels were determined pretreatment and 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms were obtained before and 48 hours after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A rhythm strip was obtained 1 week posttreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred daily following therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was noted in one patient during a follow-up endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no significant or permanent abnormality was noted in cardiac enzymes or electrocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo> or significant abnormalities in cardiac enzymes were detected following esophageal photodynamic therapy in patients with or without histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Delivery of esophageal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> is not associated with permanent adverse cardiac effects </plain></SENT>
