<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the success rate for achieving pH normalization has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (2-6 cm in length) who were found to be eligible for ablation therapy using multipolar electrocoagulation were included in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent an upper endoscopy to determine Barrett's length and other anatomic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were obtained to rule out <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg b.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hour oesophageal pH monitoring was performed after a mean period of 8.4 +/- 0.6 days of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pH test was abnormal in four (16%) of the study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An additional two (8%) patients had abnormal supine percentage time with pH less than 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in oesophageal acid control between patients with long vs. short segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Elderly (&gt; 60 years) patients tended to have less acid control than younger (&lt;/= 60 years) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Failure of oesophageal acid control in candidates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> reversal on very high dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> is not uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that ambulatory 24-h oesophageal pH monitoring should be considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> candidates for Barrett's reversal who are treated with high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> to ensure normalization of oesophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
