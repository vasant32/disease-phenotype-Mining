<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a metaplastic lesion characterized by replacement of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium by columnar intestinal epithelium containing goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is speculated that this process is an adaptation to protect cells from components of refluxate, such as gastric acid and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium, enterocytes of the distal ileum are adapted to transport <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> from the intestinal lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> transporters are utilized for effective removal of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi>, including the apical <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> transporter (ASBT), the ileal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>-binding protein (IBABP), and the multidrug-resistant protein 3 (MRP3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that one of the possible functions of newly arising metaplastic epithelium, in the esophagus, is to transport <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our major goal was to evaluate the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> transporters in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium, BE with different grades of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 101 patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR were used to detect the expression of these transporters at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our immunohistochemical studies showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> transporters are expressed in BE glands, but not in squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ASBT was found in the apical border in BE biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest frequency of ASBT expression was in patients with nondysplastic BE (9 of 15, 60%), and a progressive loss of ASBT was observed through the stages of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ASBT was not detected in EAC (0 of 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IBABP staining was observed in the cytoplasm of BE epithelial surface cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Expression of IBABP was found in 100% of nondysplastic BE (14 of 14), in 93% of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD, 15 of 16), in 73% of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD, 10 of 14), and in 33% of EAC (5 of 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MRP3 was expressed in the basolateral membrane in 93% of nondysplastic BE (13 of 14), in 60% of LGD (10 of 16), and in 86% of HGD (11 of 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only weak MRP3 staining was detected in EAC biopsies (5 of 15, 33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, RT-PCR studies showed increased expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> coding for ASBT (6.1x), IBABP (9.1x), and MRP3 (2.4x) in BE (N=13) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium (N=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of IBABP (10.1x) and MRP3 (2.5x) were also detected in EAC (N=21) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> transporters expression is increased in BE tissue at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels and that expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> transporter proteins decreased with progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
