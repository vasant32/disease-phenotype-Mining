<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of recent articles advocate that blunt esophagectomy through neck and abdominal incisions has superior perioperative results to esophagogastrectomy via thoracotomy and abdominal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prompted a review of a personal series of 40 consecutive esophagogastrectomies performed between July 1978 and December 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diseases included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137,C0751688" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous cell cancer</z:e> in 15 patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 22, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in two, and fibromyomatoses in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The approach was en bloc resection through an abdominal incision and right thoracotomy; a cervical incision and anastomosis was added for proximal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> anastomoses were hand-sewn interrupted suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perioperative results were superior to those reported for blunt esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was zero, no anastomotic leaks occurred, and no major pulmonary complications were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of the 40 patients required blood transfusions that totaled 8 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average preoperative hematocrit value was 38.9% +/- 5.44% (standard deviation) and postoperative hematocrit value was 35.57% +/- 6.06% (standard deviation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average operating time was three hours and 26 minutes +/- 41.43 minutes and hospital stay was 11.1 +/- 4.62 days (standard deviation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients required transient anastomotic dilations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that esophagogastric en bloc resection which uses an abdominal and right thoracic approach can be accomplished with a low morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A limited thoracic incision, double-lumen endotracheal tube, and self-retaining retraction on the lung minimized pulmonary trauma and respiratory problems were not a factor </plain></SENT>
