<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a metaplastic condition resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous medical and surgical therapies have failed to predictably eradicate Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the impact of long-term, high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi>, on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at least 3 cm long and with specialized columnar epithelium were treated with 60 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> each morning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Every 6 months, patients had standardized symptomatic, laboratory, and endoscopic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was measured, photo-documented, and biopsied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have been treated an average of 2.9 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptoms improved (70%, 19 patients), and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> healed (100%, 13 patients), but there was no significant reduction in the length of Barrett's epithelium (mean length at baseline 5.7 cm, final visit 5.3 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, by the final visit, 20 of 26 patients (77%) had squamous islands: two unchanged in size, six with increased surface area, and 12 newly developed on therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initially, mean fasting gastrin levels rose significantly but then plateaued after 1 month of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 10 patients with gastrin levels for 18 months or longer, only one had a level &gt; or = 400 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">Lansoprazole</z:chebi> 60 mg for up to 3 yr was safe and effective in controlling symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The impact on the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> over this time interval was manifested by the extension and development of squamous islands </plain></SENT>
