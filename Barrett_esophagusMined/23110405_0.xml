<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors aim was to evaluate prospectively the progression of SIM+ to macroscopically evident <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE/SIM+), and to identify risk factors for this progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained from a sub-group of patients (no visible BE at presentation, but SIM+) included in the ProGERD study, a prospective evaluation of the clinical course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> under routine clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> 20-40 mg/day for 2-8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptom assessment was performed annually, and endoscopy with biopsy was planned at baseline, after healing treatment and after 2 and/or 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 128 of 171 (74.8%) patients with unequivocal SIM at the z-line after healing were biopsied again after 2 and/or 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 33 (25.8%) of these patients showed progression to BE/SIM+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors significantly associated with progression were smoking, a long history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who had progressed to BE/SIM+ already at 2 years showed consistent findings at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: More than 20% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with SIM+ in this study were found to have BE/SIM+ within 2-5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the hypothesis that SIM+ at the cardia could be the missing link explaining increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients without overt BE and merits further investigation in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
