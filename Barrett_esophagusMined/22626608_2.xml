<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of RFA for the management of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic Markov model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted separate analyses of hypothetical cohorts of patients with BE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD or low-grade [LGD]) and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the analysis of the group with HGD, we compared results of initial RFA with endoscopic surveillance with surgery when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In analyzing the group with LGD or no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, we compared 3 strategies: endoscopic surveillance with surgery when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was detected (S1), endoscopic surveillance with RFA when HGD was detected (S2), and initial RFA followed by endoscopic surveillance (S3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among patients with HGD, initial RFA was more effective and less costly than endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with LGD, when S3 was compared with S2, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $18,231/quality-adjusted life-year, assuming an annual rate of progression rate from LGD to EAC of 0.5%/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, S2 was more effective and less costly than S1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a comparison of S3 with S2, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $205,500, $124,796, and $118,338/quality-adjusted life-year using annual rates of progression of no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to EAC of 0.12%, 0.33%, or 0.5% per year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By using updated data, initial RFA might not be cost effective for patients with BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, within the range of plausible rates of progression of BE to EAC, and be prohibitively expensive, from a policy perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RFA might be cost effective for confirmed and stable LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Initial RFA is more effective and less costly than endoscopic surveillance in HGD </plain></SENT>
