<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to correlate Her-2 locus (17q11.2) amplification and chromosome 17 gains as assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with Her-2 protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 34 patients with Her-2 amplification and/or chromosome 17gains using FISH on brush cytology specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (21%) showed high Her-2 locus amplification (Her-2: Cep17 &gt;/= 5 : 1), 5 (15%) showed low Her-2 locus amplification (Her-2: Cep17 &gt;/= 2 &lt; 5 : 1), and 22 (65%) displayed gains of chromosome 17 only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, we confirmed Her-2 amplification on corresponding biopsies that were taken at the same occasion as the cytologybrushings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, we compared the FISH results with IHC data obtained from the corresponding biopsies and showed that low level of Her-2 amplification does not correlate with Her-2 protein overexpression (score +3/+2; P = 1), in contrast to the high amplification level (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, in our population of BE and EAC patients, low level of Her-2 amplification does not result in detectable level of Her-2 protein as assessed by IHC </plain></SENT>
