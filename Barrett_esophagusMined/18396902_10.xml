<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identifying biomarkers of disease development and progression would be invaluable tools to inform clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis was used to screen 10 esophageal cell lines representing distinct stages in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS which demonstrated differences in expression across the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and qRT-PCR confirmed increased cathepsin D and aldo-keto reductases 1C2 and 1B10 expression in metaplastic and dysplastic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of these proteins was further assessed in esophageal epithelium from patients with nonerosive (NERD) and erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium of NERD patients, (i) cathepsin D <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels demonstrated a stepwise increase in expression (p&lt;0.05) in erosive, metaplastic and EA tissue; (ii) AKR1B10 expression increased (p&lt;0.05) 3- and 9-fold in erosive and Barrett's epithelium, respectively; and (iii) AKR1C2 levels increased (p&lt;0.05) in erosive and Barrett's epithelium, but were reduced (p&lt;0.05) in EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These proteins may contribute to disease development via effects on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, transport of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> metabolism and should be considered as candidates for further mechanistic and clinical investigations </plain></SENT>
