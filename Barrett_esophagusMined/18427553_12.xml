<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Barrett's epithelium is a precancerous, specialized columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the changes in <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> in a non-neoplastic Barrett's cell line (BAR-T), following exposure to acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi>, the two important components of gastroesophageal refluxate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>Cell phenotypes</z:mp> in BAR-T cell line were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using monoclonal antibodies against markers: cytokeratin 8/18 (CK8/18) for columnar, CK4 for squamous, mAbDas-1 for colonic epithelial <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> and p75NTR for esophageal progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells were exposed for 5 min each day to 200 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36274">glycochenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> at pH 4, pH 6 and pH 7.4 or only to acid (pH 4) for up to 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BAR-T cell line comprised 35+/-5.2% CK8/18, 32+/-3.5% mAbDas-1, 9.5+/-3% CK4 and 4+/-2.5% p75NTR-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single exposure to acid and or bile did not change <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotypes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment for at least 2 weeks significantly enhanced (P&lt;0.05) the expression of colonic phenotype and CK8/18-positive cells, as evidenced by FACS analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">Bile salt</z:chebi> at pH 4 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> followed by acid (pH 4) in succession were the strongest stimulators (P&lt;0.01) for induction of colonic phenotype cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Squamous (CK4(+)) phenotype did not change by the treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cox-2 expression was induced after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment and increased to twofold during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment, particularly in response to acidic pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that BAR-T cells can be utilized as an 'in vitro' model to study the effect of environmental factors and their influence on the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> and molecular changes in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
