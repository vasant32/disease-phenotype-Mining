<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) involves selective uptake and retention of a photosensitizer in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, followed by irradiation with light (usually a 630 nm diode laser), initiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> through formation of oxidized products or singlet oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Successful <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0152018" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers of the esophagus</z:e> and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, side effects (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, stricture, etc.) and treatment failure have been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="!"><plain>This study aims to evaluate the possible photodynamic effect induced by illumination from the endoscope on the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> effect, since a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emitted to see the lesion can potentially be a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> to treat it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two fiber endoscopes (Olympus GIFPQ20 and Pentax FG34X) and one videoendoscope (Olympus GIFQ140) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Output power, irradiance and emission spectrum were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the molar extinction coefficient of Photofrin and optical coefficients of the esophagus, the relative photodynamic reaction yield, determined as a function of depth, was compared with that obtained with a 630 nm diode laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The irradiance at 1 and 2 cm was, respectively, 18.4 and 4.6 mW/cm (Pentax FG34X), 10.6 and 2.65 mW/cm (Olympus GIFPQ20), and 2.7 and 3.2 mW/cm (Olympus GIFQ140) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest irradiance could lead to a relative photodynamic reaction yield at the surface of the esophagus similar to (Olympus GIFPQ20) or greater than (Pentax FG34X) that obtained using a diode laser alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results could explain side effects sometimes observed when performing <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>. 'Endoscopic' illumination, however, could also represent an interesting alternative to the 630 nm diode laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When using white light, superficial efficacy of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> could be reinforced and transmural <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> leading to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> or stenoses reduced, since there is less red light in depth compared with a diode laser </plain></SENT>
