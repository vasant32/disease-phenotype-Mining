<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposure of Barrett's epithelium to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> is a major stimulant for goblet cell formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dissociation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> into forms that penetrate Barrett's epithelium is known to be pH dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that variations in the esophageal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> pH environment explains the variability in goblet cell density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to correlate esophageal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> pH with goblet cell density in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A customized six-sensor pH catheter was positioned with the most distal sensor in the stomach and the remaining sensors located 1 cm below and 1, 3, 5, and 8 cm above the upper border of the lower esophageal sphincter in five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and six patients with long-segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> pH was measured by each sensor for 24-h and expressed as median pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE had four quadrant biopsies at levels corresponding to the location of the pH sensors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Goblet cell density was graded from 0 to 3 based on the number per high-power field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, the median pH values recorded in the sensors within the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and esophageal body were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> above 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with BE, the median pH recorded by the sensor within the LES was 2.8 and increased progressively to 4.7 in the sensor at 8 cm above the LES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Goblet cell density was significantly lower in the distal Barrett's segment exposed to a median pH of 2.2 and increased in the proximal Barrett's segment exposed to a median pH of 4.4 (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with BE have a goblet cell gradient that correlates directly with an esophageal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> pH gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This suggests that goblet cell differentiation is pH dependent and likely due to the effect of pH on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> dissociation </plain></SENT>
