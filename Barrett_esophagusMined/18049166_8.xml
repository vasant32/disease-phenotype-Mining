<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study establishes <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> risk in CLO by segment length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a multicentre retrospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records of 1000 patients registered from six centres were examined and data extracted on demographic factors, endoscopic features and histopathology of oesophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> incidence was evaluated for patients stratified by their diagnostic segment length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven hundred and eighty-one patients had biopsy-proven CLO and a segment length recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and ninety patients had at least 1 year of follow-up, providing 2620 patient-years of follow-up for incidence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall annual <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> incidence was 0.62%/year (95% confidence interval: 0.36-1.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence in the segment length groups was 0.59% (0.19-1.37) in short segment (&lt;or=3 cm), 0.099% (0.025-0.55) in &gt;3 &lt;or=6 cm, 0.98% (0.27-2.52) in &gt;6 &lt;or=9 cm and 2.0% (0.73-4.35) in &gt;9 cm; P=0.004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the neoplastic risk of CLO varies according to segment length, and that overall, the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> development is similar in short-segment and long-segment (&gt;3 cm) CLO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> risk was found in the longest CLO segments and lowest risk in segments &gt;3 &lt;or=6 cm </plain></SENT>
