<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic resection is, however, a technically demanding procedure, which requires training and expertise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to prospectively evaluate efficacy and safety of the first 120 endoscopic resection procedures of early esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> performed by six endoscopists (20 endoscopic resections each) who were participating in an endoscopic resection training program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The program consisted of four tri-monthly 1-day courses with lectures, live-demonstrations, hands-on training on anesthetized pigs, and one-on-one hands-on training days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gastroenterologists from centers with multidisciplinary expertise in upper gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> participated, together with an endoscopy nurse and a pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were complete endoscopic removal of the target area and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 120 consecutive esophageal endoscopic resection procedures (85 ER-cap, 35 multiband mucosectomy [MBM]) were performed by six endoscopists: 109 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 11 for squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>; 85 piecemeal endoscopic resections (median 3 specimens, interquartile range 2 - 4 specimens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete endoscopic removal was achieved in 111 /120 cases (92.5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> occurred (5.0 %): five were effectively treated endoscopically (clips, covered stent), and one patient underwent esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> (9.2 %), which were managed endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforations</z:mpath> occurred in ER-cap procedures performed by four participants (7.1 % ER-cap vs. 0 % MBM; P = 0.18), and in 1.7 % of the first 10 endoscopic resections and 8.3 % of the second 10 endoscopic resections per endoscopist (P = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this intense, structured training program, the first 120 esophageal endoscopic resections performed by six participants were associated with a 5.0 % <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> were adequately managed, performing 20 endoscopic resections may not be sufficient to reach the peak of the learning curve in endoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
