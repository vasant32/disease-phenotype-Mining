<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the most notable developments and the results of endoscopic esophageal therapeutic interventions published in 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: In 2003, three follow-up series on photodynamic therapy were published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy was shown to improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, but comparative studies with other techniques are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy was also effective in removing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1258085" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barrett epithelium</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of concern is that patients with residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> after ablative treatment are still at an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic mucosal resection has become an accepted alternative for surgical resection of early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, with increasing evidence that lesions larger than 20 mm can be safely removed by this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Completely covered plastic self-expanding stents have been demonstrated to reduce recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> by the ingrowth or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of nonmalignant tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A new indication for self-expanding metal stents is the treatment of traumatic nonmalignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stents are also increasingly used for strictures refractory to repeated dilations and as an alternative to pneumatic dilation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> can safely be treated with vasoactive drugs, which is good news for endoscopists who value a good night's rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Various follow-up studies of endoscopic antireflux procedures were published that suggested good symptomatic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, with respect to the reduction of acid exposure to the esophagus, these data were less impressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: In 2003, much additional data about current techniques became available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, new indications for existing devices were developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Finally, for some techniques more information will be needed before their exact role can be established </plain></SENT>
