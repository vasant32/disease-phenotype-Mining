<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: For a confident diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, the epithelial atypia should also involve the surface epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, pathologists are often faced with biopsies where the crypts show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, but the surface epithelium is either uninvolved or unevaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously grouped these cases with indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (IND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical significance of IND grading in Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsies from 276 prospectively followed patients with Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, who did not have high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) on initial biopsy, were graded as negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, IND, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), HGD, and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies with multifocal IND or LGD were graded as INDM or LGDM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 3 of 193 patients (2%) with an initial diagnosis of negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and only 1 of 48 patients (2%) diagnosed with IND progressed to HGD or EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, 1 of 7 patients (14%) with INDM, 2 of 21 (10%) with LGD, and 1 of 7 (14%) with LGDM progressed to HGD or EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in progression rate between patients with an initial diagnosis of negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and those diagnosed IND nor were there significant differences among patients with initial diagnoses of INDM, LGD, or LGDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with INDM, LGD, or LGDM on initial biopsy (group 1) were more likely to progress to HGD or EAC than were those patients who were diagnosed negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or IND (group 2; log-rank test, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multifocal IND in an esophageal biopsy from a patient with Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> has the same clinical implication as LGD </plain></SENT>
