<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that transhiatal oesophagectomy should remain the gold standard treatment for patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The conventional management of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the oesophagus is surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perceived high incidence of operative morbidity and mortality associated with oesophagectomy has led some to advocate alternative less invasive treatments such as endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present our data on the use of transhiatal oesophagectomy for the management of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients underwent transhiatal oesophagectomy for biopsy-proven high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in a high volume centre, between March 2000 and December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two were male and 1 female with a mean age of 63.5 years (+/- 6.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Staging was ascertained by gastroscopy, EUS and CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had PET CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade was I (2), II (14), III (6) and IV (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical anastomotic leak occurred in two patients (9%); this was managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients required intensive care admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Occult <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was found in 35% (8/23) of surgical specimens; there were no involved nodes present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No re-operations were required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median length of stay was 15 days (10-69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day and in-hospital mortality was zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was one case of locally <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e>, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> meaning that disease-free survival was 96%, and overall survival was 96% (22/23) at a mean follow-up of 35.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transhiatal oesophagectomy for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity when performed at a specialist centre </plain></SENT>
