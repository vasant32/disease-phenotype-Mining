<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is problematic, as high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> cannot be recognized endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic ultrasound lacks the resolution to detect high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) employs infrared light reflectance to provide in vivo tissue images at resolution far superior to endoscopic ultrasound, nearly at the level of histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have developed a catheter-based system well suited for study of the GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to test this catheter-based OCT system and characterize the OCT appearance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa, gastric cardia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The OCT catheter was passed through the operating channel of the endoscope and placed in contact with the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Image acquisition occurred in approximately 3 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OCT images were correlated with biopsy and/or resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OCT was used to construct 477 images of the esophagus and stomach in 69 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were unique, distinct OCT appearances of squamous mucosa, gastric cardia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, these OCT images were accurately recognized by observers unaware of their site of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OCT provides a highly detailed view of the GI wall, with clear delineation of a multiple layered structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is able to distinguish squamous mucosa, gastric cardia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This technique holds great potential as an adjunct to the surveillance of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, ulcerative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancolitis</z:e>, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant conditions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
