<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Surveillance of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) aims at early detection and treatment of neoplastic changes, particularly esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The histological evaluation of biopsy samples has its limitations, and biomarkers may improve early identification of BE patients at risk for progression to EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of p53, Ki67, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> as markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 27 BE patients with histologically proven progression to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or EAC (cases) and 27 BE patients without progression (controls) were selected and matched for age, gender, and duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> grade was determined in 212 biopsy samples obtained during surveillance endoscopies from cases and in 231 biopsy samples collected from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA ploidy status was determined by flow cytometry, whereas Ki67 and p53 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated by Cox regression adjusted for potentially confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A univariate analysis showed that low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) increased the risk of developing HGD/EAC compared with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HR 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6 - 8.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>Aneuploidy</z:mp> (HR 3.5; 95% CI: 1.3-9.4), strong Ki67 overexpression (HR 5.2; 95% CI: 1.5-17.6), and moderate p53 overexpression (HR 6.5; 95% CI: 2.5-17.1) were also associated with an increased risk of developing HGD/EAC, independent of the histological result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A multivariable analysis showed that in the presence of LGD, p53 overexpression, and to a lesser extent, Ki67 overexpression remained important risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was no longer predictive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: p53 overexpression and, to a lesser extent, Ki67 overexpression could predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in BE irrespective of the histological result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These markers may be useful for identifying patients at an increased risk of developing EAC, either alone or used as a panel </plain></SENT>
