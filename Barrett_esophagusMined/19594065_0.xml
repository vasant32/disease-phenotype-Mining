<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> are diagnosed in advanced stages, when the prognosis is poorer than in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to analyze the demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of patients operated on for Barrett's, cardia and distal <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, as well as to study the influence of manifestations of each cancerogenetic indication on the studied clinicopathological parameters and to analyze the 5-year survival rate of patients surgically treated for cardia <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in relation to the patients operated on for distal <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed gender and age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> type, depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> invasion, involvement of blood and lymph vessels in 66 patients surgically treated at the Centre for Oesophageal Surgery of the Institute for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Digestive Diseases</z:e> of the Belgrade Clinical Centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Except for significant differences in the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> invasion during surgery, there were no other statistically significant differences between the studied groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patients operated on for Barrett's and cardia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> invaded more deeply the wall layers, i.e. they were significantly more invasive than the distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastric tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lymph node involvement was present in 87.5% of patients with Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, in 80% with cardia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and in 87% with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3-year survival rate of patients operated on for cardia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was 47.4% and the 5-year survival rate was 31.6%, while the 3-year survival rate of patients operated on for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> was 46.2% and the 5-year survival rate was 34.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences were not statistically significant (Wilcoxon 0.036; p = 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Singly, the patients' gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type and the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> differentiation had no influence on the length of patients' postsurgical survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: At the time of diagnosis cardia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> developed at the location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, developed significant deeper per continuitatem than <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no other differences in regard to the analyzed clinicopathological parameters among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> of these three locations, and there was no difference between the 3-year and 5-year survival rate between the patients operated on for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> and cardia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
