<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Immunostaining for cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and cytokeratin 20 (CK20) has a characteristic pattern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), but reports regarding its sensitivity and specificity are inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastric cardia (CIM) is histologically similar to BE, but with no abnormal endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a semi-quantitative CK7/CK20 immunostaining pattern for the diagnosis of BE, and to further elucidate the pathogenesis of CIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissues were examined by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi> schiff/alcian blue stains, and then were immunostained with CK7 and CK20 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlations with other clinical parameters were statistically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When values were revised based on follow-up data and auxiliary testing, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BE cases (100%) displayed the characteristic BE CK7/CK20 immunostaining pattern, compared with 66% of CIM cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of patients who were endoscopically and immunohistochemistry-positive but histologically negative, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except for one had documented BE when clinical history, auxiliary testing and follow-up were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between BE and CIM regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> or the type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (complete versus incomplete) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the CK7/CK20 pattern reached 100% in the subgroup of CIM patients with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 26 cases of CIM where follow-up was available, four cases (15%) progressed to BE, and one developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four cases showed the BE pattern of CK7/CK20 staining and were negative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A semiquantitative CK7/CK20 pattern can be used to confirm BE even in the absence of histological evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The subgroup of CIM with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> may develop into BE and may need closer follow-up </plain></SENT>
