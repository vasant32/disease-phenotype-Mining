<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To test this hypothesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) classified into two types and to further determine if there was any correlation between the shape of endoscopically suspected esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (ESEM), prevalence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE) and heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 6504 Japanese who underwent endoscopy for their annual stomach check-up were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BE was detected without histological confirmation that is ESEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We originally classified cases of ESEM into 3 types based on its shape: Tongue-like (T type), Dome-like (D type) and Wave-like (W type) ESEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The respective subjects were prospectively asked to complete questionnaires concerning the symptoms of heartburn, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> for a one-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ESEM was observed in 10.3% of 6504 subjects (ESEM &lt; 1 cm, 9.4%; 1 cm &lt; or = ESEM &lt; 3 cm, 1.7%; ESEM &gt; or = 3 cm, 0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of ESEM was significantly higher in males compared with female subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis showed that the prevalence of heartburn and RE were significantly higher in the T type ESEM than in the W type ESEM (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The T type ESEM was strongly asso-ciated with reflux symptoms and RE whereas the W type ESEM was not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
