<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and is considered a risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study of the mucus, especially acid mucins, such as the sialomucins in the goblet cells which characterize BE, showed that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, frequent in the digestive tract, the organ's original epithelium could express Tn and Stn antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These antigens have already been detected in gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic tumors</z:e>, however references in BE were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This research aimed to analyze these antigens in patients with BE and in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Utilizing immunohistochemistry tests, Tn and Stn antigens were studied in the endoscopic biopsies of 29 patients with BE and seven with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in BE, as well as eight individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium at upper digestive endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Stn antigen was positive in the goblet cells of patients with BE in 100% of the cases and the Tn was positive in 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the columnar cells, Stn was always negative, while Tn was positive in 100% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in BE, both antigens were 100% positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, the Tn antigen was positive and the antigen Stn negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is probable that the BE group in which the Tn antigens in the goblet cells are positive, similarly to the same antigen in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> group, might indicate a higher susceptibility for potential occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the future, trials with sialomucins could be used routinely, thereby contributing as a prognostic factor of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in BE </plain></SENT>
