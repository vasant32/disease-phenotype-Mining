<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is due in part to its multitude of histological appearances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One aspect receiving little attention concerns gastric-type Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, which is distinctly different from the well-established intestinal variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recognition of gastric-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and development of separate grading criteria are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence, diagnostic criteria, and natural history of gastric-type Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were systematically evaluated in 1854 endoscopic biopsies from a cohort of 200 consecutive Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Goblet cells were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, confirming the utility of this defining feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Barrett's gastric-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 15% at the patient level (30 of 200 patients) and 20% at the biopsy level (166 of 852 dysplastic biopsies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gastric-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> uniformly showed non-stratified, basally oriented nuclei as the major criterion for distinguishing it from intestinal-type Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As such, loss of nuclear polarity, as the most objective criterion to distinguish intestinal-type low- and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, cannot be applied to gastric-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rather, discriminatory features included increased nuclear size with a high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> cutoff by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis approximating 3-4 times the size of a mature lymphocyte, providing an optimal sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of 0.78, 0.90, and 0.90 (95% CI: (0.87, 0.93)), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Crowded, irregular glandular architecture (P&lt;0.001) was more common in high-grade lesions (P&lt;0.001), as was eosinophilic and oncocytic cytoplasm relative to the mucinous cytoplasm (P&lt;0.001), prominent nucleoli (P&lt;0.001), mild nuclear pleomorphism (P&lt;0.001), and villiform architecture (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 64% (7 of 11) of patients with pure gastric and 26% (5 of 19) with mixed gastric and <z:mp ids='MP_0000477'>intestinal dysplasia</z:mp> underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The recognition of Barrett's gastric-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and use of the proposed grading criteria should promote better diagnostic classification of the Barrett's neoplastic spectrum </plain></SENT>
