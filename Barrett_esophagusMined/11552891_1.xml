<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">Gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> (GOR) is demonstrated by radiography as a supplement to 24-h pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-two patients (mean age 44 years) with suspicion of GOR disease were assessed according to a standard questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GOR was investigated by 24-h pH-monitoring and by radiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oesophageal emptying and the presence of rings or strictures were registered as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mucosal biopsies, classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, light <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, were correlated to age, gender, symptomatology, pH monitoring, and oesophageal emptying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GOR and morphological changes demonstrated by radiography were correlated to pH monitoring and mucosa biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on pH monitoring, patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> had a significantly higher acid exposure compared to patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa and light <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, with no difference concerning age, gender, and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, was found only in patients with a positive test for radiologic GOR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had rings or strictures independent of oesophageal mucosal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: GOR demonstrated by radiography identified patients where complications could be expected, which was not possible by pH monitoring alone </plain></SENT>
