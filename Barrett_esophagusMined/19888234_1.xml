<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are currently at level 3, despite small prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>What is ideally required is a very large prospective assessment of biopsies in large cohorts, such as the ASPirin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">Esomeprazole</z:chebi> Chemoprevention Trial (AspECT) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> Surveillance Study (BOSS) trials, so that unbiased and random selection of cases can be subjected to rigorous pathology and biomarker assessment (level 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only then can the predictive power of the data be exploited in a randomized intervention trial (level 5) whereby a series of biomarkers would trigger therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The real trouble is that this spot is currently occupied, satisfactorily according to some researchers, by conventional histological identification of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) as used in a recent randomized study of ablation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
