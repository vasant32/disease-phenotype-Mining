<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mortality and morbidity rates are substantial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A new therapeutic approach involving low-risk endoscopic therapy modalities was examined in the framework of a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 115 patients with intraepithelial high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (19) and early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (96) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was used in 70 patients, and photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) was used in 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two procedures were combined in ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent primary treatment with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up was 34 +/- 10 months (range 24-60 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete local remission was achieved in 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall complication rate was 9.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Major complications, such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Minor complications included not <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> relevant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (drop of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> less than 2 g/dl) (5) and stenosis (3) after EMR, and long-lasting odynophagia (1) and sunburn (2) after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 13 patients have died so far, but in only one case due to the underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The calculated overall 3-year survival rate is 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, a 30% rate of metachronous lesions was observed; endoscopic therapy was performed successfully in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These good <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase and intermediate results, along with low morbidity rates and no mortality, suggest that the organ-preserving local endoscopic procedure including EMR and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> is an attractive alternative to oesophageal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, endoscopic therapy might replace radical oesophageal resection in future in cases of intraepithelial high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and early mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
