<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to develop and validate explicit, consensus-driven criteria for the endoscopic diagnosis and grading of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An international working group agreed on criteria and developed materials for their formal evaluation using video-endoscopic recordings gathered in a standardized manner in 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The criteria included assessment of the circumferential (C) and maximum (M) extent of the endoscopically visualized BE segment as well as endoscopic landmarks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recordings were scored according to these criteria by a separate international panel of 29 endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Prague C &amp; M Criteria give explicit guidance on the endoscopic recognition of BE and grading of its extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall reliability coefficients (RC) for the assessment of the C &amp; M extent of the endoscopic BE segment above the gastroesophageal junction were 0.95 and 0.94, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rates of exact agreement (for C &amp; M values) for pairwise comparisons of individual patient values were 53% and 38%, respectively, whereas the values for agreement within a 2-cm interval were 97% and 95%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall RC for endoscopic recognition of BE &gt;/=1 cm was 0.72, whereas for BE &lt;1 cm, it was 0.22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The RCs for recognizing the location of the gastroesophageal junction and the diaphragmatic hiatus were 0.88 and 0.85, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Prague C &amp; M Criteria have high overall validity for the endoscopic assessment of visualized BE lengths </plain></SENT>
