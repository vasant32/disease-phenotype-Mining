<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine DNA content abnormalities in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) who progress to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, using image cytometric DNA analysis (ICDA) of formalin-fixed tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies were performed on archived biopsies of BE patients' undergoing endoscopic surveillance before developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparison group consisted of BE patients' free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> during a follow-up period of over 9 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections were analyzed for the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and for DNA content abnormalities, using image cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional patients were also analyzed in a cross-sectional study of 56 BE cases with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, including 12 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> during follow-up and earlier biopsies obtained before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis showed specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) followed by low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) in one, SIM followed by high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) in one, LGD in two, and HGD in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five showed some DNA abnormality at baseline or in interval biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the comparison group, five of seven patients showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diploid DNA at baseline and on follow-up biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient initially had diploid DNA, but developed <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> 11 yr later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Another case initially had <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, but was diploid on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, DNA abnormalities were found in 13% of cases with SIM without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 60% with LGD, 73% with HGD, and 100% with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (i) Image cytometric DNA analysis is a useful method to examine DNA abnormalities in formalin-fixed tissues and may be more sensitive in predicting progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> than HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(ii) Histological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of any grade and DNA abnormalities, help identify BE patients at high risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
