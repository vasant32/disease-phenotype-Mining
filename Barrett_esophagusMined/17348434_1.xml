<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of collision <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) in the residual cervical esophagus of a 68-year-old woman at 27 years after subtotal esophagectomy for thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient initially noticed cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in 2002, but did not seek treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In April 2004, the patient was referred to our department by a local physician with the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the cervical esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In September 2004, the patient underwent resection of the cervical esophagus and partial resection of the gastric tube combined with cervical lymph node dissection under a diagnosis of double <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (i.e., metachronous cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the gastric tube) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophagogastric continuity was restored by transplantation of a free jejunal graft with vascular anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> on the esophageal side of the esophagogastric anastomosis and columnar epithelium with a tongue-shaped extension across the anastomotic line that included Barrett's epithelium, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, on the gastric tube side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were contiguous, but there was a distinct border between them and no morphological transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining showed positivity for p53 in the squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells, while it was negative in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, HER2 (c-erb-2) was strongly positive in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells, but negative in the squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, it was concluded that two separate <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> had arisen at different sites and grown independently until they collided and merged to form a collision <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
