<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic optical coherence tomography (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi>) is a high-resolution, cross-sectional tissue-imaging technique that provides microscopic morphologic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> should detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's epithelium, but this has not been established in a prospective blinded study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the accuracy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> for the diagnosis and the exclusion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 2.4-mm diameter <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> probe was modified for use with a cap-fitted, two-channel endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pairs of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> image streams and jumbo biopsy specimens were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> procedures were performed by 4 endoscopists who separately reviewed the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> digital images for the absence or the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (low grade, high grade, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) for each biopsy specimen obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The endoscopists were blinded to the interpretation of the pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An experienced pathologist blinded to the endoscopic/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> findings evaluated each biopsy for the absence or the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The setting of the study was a major academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adult patients with documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> greater than 2 cm were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measurement was the accuracy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> in the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 314 usable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> image stream/biopsy pairs were obtained in 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By using histology as the standard, the performance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> was sensitivity, 68%; specificity, 82%; positive predictive value, 53%; negative predictive value, 89%; and diagnostic accuracy, 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy for the 4 endoscopists ranged from 56% to 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Limitations of the study were the variability in endoscopists' accuracy rates, difficulty in real-time interpretation, and the need for refined criteria of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> system has an accuracy of 78% for the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> could be used to target biopsies to areas of Barrett's epithelium with a higher probability for the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, further modifications, including increased resolution and identification of further potential OCT characteristics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, are needed before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> can be used clinically </plain></SENT>
