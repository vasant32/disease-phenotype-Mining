<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alkaline reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> is a complication that might develop in patients with total gastrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence and severity of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and the occurence of complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo>) in patients with total gastrectomy and Roux en Y esojejunostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 92 patients with total gastrectomy performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> prior to gastrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were assessed clinically and endoscopically after a certain interval from surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An important number of patients (14 out of 92, 15.22%) had reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>; 5.43% of the patients had also complications of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo>) and 6.52% had local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, the majority (9/14) had Los Angeles (LA) grade C <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between surgery and the endoscopic evaluation was 4.43 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and benign stenosis were diagnosed after a longer period of time (10.33 and 8 years, respectively) as compared to reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (5.29 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More than half of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients had reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although Roux en Y esojejunostomy is a reconstructive technique which prevents the reflux, an important percentage of our patients developed alkaline reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was moderate or severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complications of alkaline reflux, i.e. benign stenosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, also occurred after longer periods of time (8 to 10 years) in a small percentage of patients </plain></SENT>
