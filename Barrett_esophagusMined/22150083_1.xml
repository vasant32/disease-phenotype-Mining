<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to conduct a retrospective investigation of the efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 78 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of the preoperative endoscopic biopsies: a non-intestinal group (n = 63) with fundic or cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, an intestinal group (n = 18) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and a dysplastic group (n = 7) with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was available in the case of 64 patients at a mean of 42 Â± 16.9 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Check-up examination revealed total regression of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Partial regression was seen in 9 cases, no further progression in 34 patients, and progression into cardiac or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No cases of dysplastic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Where we observed the regression of BE, among the postoperative functional examinations results of manometry (pressure of lower esophageal sphincter) and pH-metry were significantly better compared with those groups where no changes occurred in BE, or progression of BE was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results highlight the importance of the cases of fundic and cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, which can also transform into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Antireflux surgery can appropriately control the reflux disease in a majority of the patients who had unsuccessful medical treatment, and it may inhibit the progression and induce the regression of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in a significant proportion of these patients </plain></SENT>
