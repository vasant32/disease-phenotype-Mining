<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a highly premalignant disease that predisposes to the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC); however, the involvement of microRNAs (miRs) in BE-EAC carcinogenic progression is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Esophageal cultured cells (HEEpiC, QhTRT, ChTRT, GihTRT, and OE-33) and esophageal tissues (22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelia, 24 BE, and 22 EAC) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MiR microarrays and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were employed to explore and verify differentially expressed miRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative genomic PCR was performed to study copy number variation at the miR-106b-25 polycistron and MCM7 gene locus on chromosome 7q22.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro cell proliferation, cell cycle, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> assays and in vivo <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> experiments were performed to elucidate biologic effects of the miR-106b-25 polycistron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and luciferase assays were performed to confirm direct <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) targeting by the miR-106b-25 polycistron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The miR-106b-25 polycistron exerted potential proliferative, antiapoptotic, cell cycle-promoting effects in vitro and tumorigenic activity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MiRs-93 and -106b targeted and inhibited p21, whereas miR-25 targeted and inhibited <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This polycistron was upregulated progressively at successive stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, in association with genomic amplification and overexpression of MCM7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, miRs-93 and -106b decreased p21 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, whereas miR-25 did not alter <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, suggesting the following discrete miR effector mechanisms: (1) for p21, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> degradation; (2) for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi>, translational inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The miR-106b-25 polycistron is activated by genomic amplification and is potentially involved in esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> and proliferation via suppression of 2 target genes: p21 and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
