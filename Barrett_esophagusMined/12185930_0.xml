<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal motor disorders</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> after surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: From January 1993 to September 1998 a prospective study with 25 patients referred to our service for surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">Barium</z:chebi> transit, endoscopy, 24-hour monitoring of intraluminal pH and stationary esophageal manometry were carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients pre- and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 18 male (72%) and 7 women (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 54.20 +/- 13.29 years (range: 25-71 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent clinical manifestation was heartburn (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A laparotomy procedure was performed in 68% (n = 17) and laparoscopy in 32% (n = 8) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 360 degrees fundoplication was always performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 96% of patients presented a defective lower esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The statistical study demonstrated significant differences after surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pH-metric parameters and lower esophageal sphincter (p &lt; 0.01), except for relaxation (p = 0.465) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the esophageal body, the statistical study only demonstrated significant differences for mean pressure of the peristaltic waves in segment I (p = 0.038) and mean rate of non-transmitted waves in esophageal segment IV-V (p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Antireflux surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> contributes to the control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> improving esophageal clearing and with significant differences for the mean rate of non-transmitted waves in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
