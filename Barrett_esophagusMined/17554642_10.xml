<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Guided biopsies from neoplastic areas invisible on conventional endoscopy may increase effectiveness of surveillance examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the accuracy of endocytoscopy in correlation with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 166 biopsy sites from 16 patients (13 male, mean age 62.1 years), without visible lesions, who presented for Barrett surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endocytoscopy images were recorded from pre-marked areas in the Barrett's segment using magnification x 1125 or x 450 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were taken from the same area to allow precise comparison with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Image sequences of each area were individually and blindly reviewed by a pathologist and a gastroenterologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major outcome variables included image quality, identification of neoplastic characteristics, and accuracy of endocytoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was histologically diagnosed in 4.2% of biopsy sites, high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) in 16.9%, and low grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (LGIN) in 12.1 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adequate assessment of endocytoscopy images was impossible in 49% of the pre-marked areas with magnification x 450 and in 22% with magnification x 1125 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At most, 23% of images with lower magnification were interpretable to identify characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, and 41% with higher magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was fair at best (kappa from &lt; 0 to 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Positive and negative predictive values for HGIN or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were 0.29 and 0.87, respectively, for magnification x 450 and 0.44 and 0.83, respectively, for magnification x 1125 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When not supported by macroscopic evidence, endoscopic histology using endocytoscopy lacks sufficient image quality to be currently of assistance in identifying neoplastic areas </plain></SENT>
