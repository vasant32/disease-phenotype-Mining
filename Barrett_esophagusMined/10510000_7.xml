<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment and standard antireflux operations show a high failure rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An elongated gastroplasty, wrapped by a total fundoplication should provide a tension-free repair with adequate protection against reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to review the operative effects of a Collis-Nissen gastroplasty to treat reflux in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1989 to December 1997, 45 patients with BE (38 men, 7 women) aged 53.5 years, underwent a Collis-Nissen gastroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up is 35.9 months (range, 6 to 110 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative evaluations included symptom assessment, esophagogram, endoscopy, manometry, 24-hour pH study, and esophageal emptying scintigrams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> reflux symptoms were controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">Acid reflux</z:e> was significantly reduced (percent time exposure decreased from 10% to 1%) and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure were restored to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (LES gradient increased from 4 mm Hg to 11 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LES incomplete relaxation was noted in 50% of patients postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopically, mucosal damage from reflux healed but the columnar mucosa with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Collis-Nissen gastroplasty, in patients with BE, controls reflux disease, its symptoms, and the mucosal damage associated with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It restores the LES gradient but increases the resistance to bolus transit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There is no regression of the abnormal mucosa despite reflux control </plain></SENT>
