<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography is a new, high spatial-resolution, cross-sectional imaging technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the ability of optical coherence tomography to provide detailed images of subsurface structures in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Optical coherence tomography was performed during routine upper GI endoscopy on 32 patients including 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An endoscopic mucosal biopsy was obtained immediately after imaging and was used for histopathologic correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Optical coherence tomography provided clear delineation of layers of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human esophagus extending from the epithelium to the longitudinal muscularis propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gastric mucosa was differentiated from esophageal mucosa, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was differentiated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa, and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was distinguished from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Optical coherence tomography allows visualization of the subsurface architectural <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the upper GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic information provided by this new imaging modality suggests that it may be a useful adjunct to endoscopy </plain></SENT>
