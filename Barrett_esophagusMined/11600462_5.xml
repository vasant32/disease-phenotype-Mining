<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While loss of p53 function is a key oncogenic step in human <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, mutations of p53 are generally viewed as late events in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports of a series of genes (p63, p73, and others) exhibiting close homology to p53 raise the possibility that abnormalities of these p53 family members may exert their influence earlier in the sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: Following recent characterisation of expression of p63 and a major isoform DeltaNp63 by generation of an antiserum that recognises p63 isoforms, but not p53, our aim was a comparative study of expression of p63 protein and p53 protein in a morphologically well defined biopsy series representative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 60 biopsy cases representing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophagus through to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were stained, using immunohistochemistry, with antibodies to p63 and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsies derived from patients with endoscopic and histopathological substantiation of a diagnosis of traditional/classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was exact concordance in p53 and p63 expression in more advanced forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, while p63, but not p53, was detected in the proliferative compartment of some non-neoplastic oesophageal tissue, in both squamous mucosa and in the non-neoplastic metaplastic glandular epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In neoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> there is upregulation of both p63 and p53 while p63 isoforms may well have an important role in epithelial biology in both non-metaplastic and metaplastic mucosa of the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While abnormalities of p53 function represent an indisputable and critical element of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e>, other closely linked genes and their proteins have a role in both the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and pathophysiology of the oesophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
