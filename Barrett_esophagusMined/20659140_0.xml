<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transnasal ultrathin esophagogastroduodenoscopy (N-EGD) with less gagging reflexes under non-sedation is likely suitable for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), however, N-EGD might have drawbacks, including its low image resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited information is available regarding the diagnosability of N-EGD for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the utility and gagging reflexes of three different endoscopies, including N-EGD, ultrathin transoral EGD (UTO-EGD) and conventional oral EGD (CO-EGD), in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed screening endoscopy in 1580 patients (N-EGD n=727, UTO-EGD n=599, CO-EGD n=254) and compared the frequency distributions of the severity of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>, and Barrett's epithelium to estimate the diagnostic performance of each endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed patients' tolerability of endoscopy by the subjective evaluation of gagging reflexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the diagnosis of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's epithelium, there was no significant difference in the frequency distributions of the severity of the diseases among three EGDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of Barrett's epithelium was higher than that in the previous nationwide survey of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The evaluated size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> was smaller in N-EGD than in two other peroral endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> correlated significantly with severity of gagging reflexes that was also lowest when diagnosed with N-EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>N-EGD had an equivalent performance in the diagnosis of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's epithelium compared with CO-EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Enlargement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> induced by gagging reflexes was minimal in N-EGD, resulting in its better performance in the diagnosis of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
