<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secretory phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)) is a known mediator of gut <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and its levels are increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the sPLA(2) gene is required to produce esophageal mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> in response to gastroduodenal reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C57BL/6 (n = 5) sPLA(2) (-/-) mice and C57BL/6( Cg-Tg(PLA2G2A)703N16 ) mice (n = 4) sPLA(2) (-/+) underwent a side-to-side surgical anastomosis between the duodenum and gastroesophageal junction (DGEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control animals [sPLA(2) (-/-) (n = 5), sPLA(2) (-/+) (n = 4)] underwent laparotomy with incision and repair of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue was harvested after 4 weeks, and H&amp;E staining was performed to quantify esophageal mucosal thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ki67 and sPLA(2) immunostaining were performed to quantitate differences in cell division and sPLA(2) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mice expressing human sPLA(2) had a 2.5-fold increase in thickness of the esophageal mucosa as compared to controls (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 6.5-fold increase in proliferation (p = 0.02) and a twofold increase in sPLA(2) expression (p = 0.04) were demonstrated in animals exposed to gastroduodenal reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of sPLA(2) is necessary for early mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> produced by exposure of the esophagus to gastroduodenal contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>sPLA(2) expression is upregulated by gastroduodenal reflux, strengthening its role as a critical mediator of early mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
