<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: This study was undertaken to identify the clinical value of incidentally detected lesions (IDLs) in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) with (18)F-FDG PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The reported database of 3,281 patients who underwent partial-body (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans from April 2001 to September 2003 was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with incidental (18)F-FDG accumulations in the GIT that were associated with concomitant abnormal soft-tissue density or wall thickening on the native CT were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidental PET/CT findings were correlated with endoscopic and histopathologic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to our selection criteria, 98 (3%) of the 3,281 patients had an IDL of the GIT on (18)F-FDG PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlative endoscopic findings were available in 69 (70%) of 98 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 13 patients (19%) were harboring newly occurring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of the GIT in addition to preexisting aerodigestive tract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (n = 12) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine (42%) patients were identified with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e>, such as advanced colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (n = 27), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 1), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastric mucosa (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory and other benign GIT lesions were detected in 12 (17%) and 6 (8%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 9 (13%) patients, PET/CT was false-positive, showing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings in subsequent endoscopic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 20 (28%) of 69 patients, PET/CT findings had a relevant impact on the clinical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine (30%) of the 98 patients were not subject to a further endoscopic examination because of the extent and nature of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> (n = 17), loss to follow-up (n = 7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> shortly after PET (n = 3), and patient unwillingness (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although IDLs of the GIT on (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans are found only in about 3% of cases, they are associated with a substantial risk of an underlying cancerous or precancerous lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Early identification of these occult lesions may have a major impact on the patients' management and outcome </plain></SENT>
