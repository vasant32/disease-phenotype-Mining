<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The condition is mainly seen in adults and is thought to be a complex disease in which individual genetic predisposition interacts with environmental stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate whether genetic biomarkers of potential disease progression are the same in the rare situation of pediatric BE, as described in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes from Abbott Vysis Corporation on 4-micron sections taken from 48 paraffin-embedded sequential biopsies of 10 cases of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 4 probe sets were specific for HER2 at 17q12/17 centromere/4 centromere, p16 at 9p21/9 centromere, TP53 at 17p13/17 centromere/6 centromere, and CCND1 at 11q13/11 centromere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probe sets were validated on 10 cases of adult Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 cases, 6 biopsies in 5 cases were informative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two had gain of HER2 detected in 1 biopsy each (1 also had gain of chromosome 17) and 4 separate cases showed p16 deletion in 1 biopsy of each (1 also had gain of chromosome 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The genetic markers informative in 50% of our cases were also identified in adult patients with Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The importance of this study is that even at the pediatric level, BE can show genetic changes associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
