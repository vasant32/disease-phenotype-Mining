<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a corresponding trend of BE-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has yet to be observed in Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Historically, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> complicating BE has been considered a rare event in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present report, we collected three Taiwanese cases of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising from BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first case was a 37-year-old man with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> that developed on pre-existing BE after a 3-year interval without endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second case was a 63-year-old man who presented with odynophagia and was found to have an ulcerative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> centered on the characteristic Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final case was a 44-year-old man who presented with gradual-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, without typical reflux symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our report emphasizes the need for an updated epidemiologic study to determine the incidence of BE-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
