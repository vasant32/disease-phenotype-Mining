<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase NOX5-S may play an important role in the progression from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) by increasing cell proliferation and decreasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of the acid-induced NOX5-S-mediated increase in cell proliferation is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that, in SEG1 EA cells, the acid-induced increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) production was mediated by activation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) but not by COX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acid treatment increased intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>, and a blockade of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> increase inhibited the acid-induced increase in COX2 expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of NOX5-S or NF-kappaB1 p50 by their small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> significantly inhibited acid-induced COX2 expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> production in SEG1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acid treatment significantly decreased IkappaBalpha and increased luciferase activity when SEG1 cells were transfected with an NF-kappaB in vivo activation reporter plasmid, pNF-kappaB-Luc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a novel Barrett's cell line overexpressing NOX5-S, IkappaBalpha was significantly reduced, and luciferase activity increased when these Barrett's cells were transfected with pNF-kappaB-Luc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of NOX5-S in Barrett's cells significantly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> production, COX2 expression, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> production, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation occurring in NOX5-S-overexpressing Barrett's cells or induced by acid treatment in SEG1 EA cells was significantly decreased by COX2 inhibitors or small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that acid-induced COX2 expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> production depend on an increase in cytosolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> and sequential activation of NOX5-S and NF-kappaB in SEG1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>COX2-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> production may contribute to NOX5-S-mediated cell proliferation in SEG1 cells </plain></SENT>
