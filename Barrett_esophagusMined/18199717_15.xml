<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, AKAP12 promoter hypermethylation was reported in gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined AKAP12 promoter hypermethylation using real-time methylation-specific PCR in 259 human esophageal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AKAP12 hypermethylation showed highly discriminative receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve profiles, clearly distinguishing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) from esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AKAP12-normalized methylation values were significantly higher in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BE), dysplastic Barrett's, and EAC than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (P &lt; 0.0000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AKAP12 hypermethylation frequency was zero in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus but increased early during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>, to 38.9% in BE from patients with Barrett's alone, 52.5% in dysplastic Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, and 52.2% in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AKAP12 hypermethylation levels were significantly higher in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelia from patients with EAC (mean = 0.00082) than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagi from patients without Barrett's or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> (mean = 0.00007; P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between AKAP12 hypermethylation and BE segment length, a known clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 2 (7.7%) of 26 esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> exhibited AKAP12 hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of BIC and OE33 EAC cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> reduced AKAP12 methylation and increased AKAP12 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AKAP12 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in EACs with unmethylated AKAP12 (mean = 0.1663) were higher than in EACs with methylated AKAP12 (mean = 0.0668) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that promoter hypermethylation of AKAP12 is a common, tissue-specific event in human EAC, occurs early during Barrett's-associated esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>, and is a potential biomarker for the early detection of EAC </plain></SENT>
