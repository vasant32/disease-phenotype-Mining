<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was done on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non dysplastic Barrett's mucosa was diploid in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 11 studied cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic mucosa was aneuploid in the 4 studied cases, as were the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> in the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were diploid, and 16 aneuploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between the <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 15 tumors which invaded the adventitia and only 2 of the 8 tumors which were limited to the muscularis propria were aneuploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 16 aneuploid and only 2 of 7 diploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had lymph node invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six of the 7 patients with diploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were well 12 to 52 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 16 patients with aneuploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> died, the remaining 5 were well 12 to 18 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ratio of aneuploid <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> developed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is similar to the ratio observed in other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to our results, the prognosis of diploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> seems to be better than that of aneuploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the value of ADN-ploidy as an independent prognostic criterion, it would be of interest to study a greater number of patients with longer follow-up </plain></SENT>
