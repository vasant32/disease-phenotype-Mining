<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Various techniques are available for EMR in the upper- and lower-GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0152018" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers of the esophagus</z:e>, the "suck and cut" technique, which uses a transparent cap or variceal band ligator, is the most commonly practiced method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To facilitate multiple or circumferential EMR, a modified multiband variceal ligator (MBL) is introduced, which allows sequential banding and snare resection without the need to withdraw the endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the feasibility of modified MBL device in facilitating circumferential EMR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) that contains high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) and/or intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (IMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: To enable band delivery with a snare inserted in the therapeutic endoscope, the threading channel of the cranking device is enlarged from 2 to 3.2 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 6-shooter MBL was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Ten consecutive patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men; median age, 62 years; range 43-82 years) with BE were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IMC and HGIN were found in 8 and 2 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: EMR was performed with pure coagulating current when using a 1.5 x 2.5-cm mini hexagonal polypectomy snare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No submucosal saline solution injection was performed before resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 5 of 10 patients with circumferential BE of 2 to 9 cm in length (median, 4 cm), complete circumferential EMR was performed in 1 session by using 3 to 18 bands (median, 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients with 3- to 10-cm (median, 4 cm) long segment BE required 2 to 5 sessions (median, 3) with a total of 5 to 42 bands (median, 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Another patient with multifocal HGIN and/or IMC in 24 of a total of 49 specimens was finally recommended for surgery because of technical difficulties caused by mural thickening after 4 sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No serious procedure-related complications were observed, except for 2 minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp>, which were controlled endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Seven patients developed strictures after circumferential EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients except 1 were successfully managed by weekly bougienage after a median of 5 sessions (range 3-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Deep-wall tears developed in 1 patient during the fourth bougienage session, for which limited distal esophageal resection was performed with an uneventful outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The novel technique of MBL-EMR described here facilitated and simplified circumferential removal of BE that contained HGIN and/or IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the method is associated with a very high stricture rate if circumferential EMR is performed in a single session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Complete removal of BE should be achieved by repeated partial EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up is needed to observe for late recurrence and to determine the clinical impact of this method </plain></SENT>
