<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been reported that there are four zones of distinct venous patterns around the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ); i.e. truncal, perforating, palisade (PZ) and gastric zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the distal end of PZ as a marker for GEJ, this study was done to assess the length and patterns of PZ in Koreans, and to assess the prevalence of endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (E-BE) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (E-HH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 847 consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic endoscopy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During endoscopy, PZ, squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) and pinchcock action (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patterns were classified according to the relationships of the distal end of PZ with SCJ and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>; A: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three at the same level, B: SCJ proximal to the other two which are at the same level, C: <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> distal to the other two which are at the same level, D: SCJ proximal to the distal end of PZ which is proximal to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with patterns B and D were thought to have E-BE, and those with patterns C and D to have E-HH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patterns A, B, C and D were 79.2%, 12.1%, 3.8% and 4.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Length of PZ was 3.0 +/- 0.1 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>E-BE and E-HH were found in 17.0% and 8.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both E-BE and E-HH were more frequently found in males and in cases with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: E-BE and E-HH are not so infrequent in Koreans as previously thought, if we use the distal end of PZ as an endoscopic marker of GEJ </plain></SENT>
