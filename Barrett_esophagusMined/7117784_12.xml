<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine if esophageal transmural electrical potential difference measurements are of use for evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e>, we recorded potential difference in 129 patients with one or more of the following: heartburn, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> potential difference studies were performed at the time of esophageal manometry using a Ringer-perfused catheter technique which yields accurate and reproducible results in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 103 of the 129 patients, esophageal potential difference measurements could be correlated with findings at manometry, endoscopy, and biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 26 patients had primary esophageal motor disease and were not biopsied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this investigation showed: (a) that 94% of patients with gross endoscopic lesions have an abnormal esophageal potential difference, (b) that an abnormal esophageal potential difference (found in only 1 of 24 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa) is highly specific for the presence of esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucosal disease</z:e>, (c) that the type of potential difference abnormality may suggest the nature of the mucosal abnormality, for example high potential difference with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and low potential difference with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and (d) that while an abnormal esophageal potential difference is highly sensitive for detecting gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (38 of 40 patients), it is less sensitive for diagnosing microscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (8 of 16 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings we conclude that the measurement of esophageal potential difference at the time of manometry can provide additional valuable information about the state of the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
