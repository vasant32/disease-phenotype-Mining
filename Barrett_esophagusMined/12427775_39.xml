<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Barrett's epithelium (BE) has malignant potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neither acid suppression nor antireflux surgery produce consistent or complete regression of the metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic thermoablation with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) offers a different approach but factors influencing its outcome have not been systematically examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the efficacy of APC and factors influencing initial and one year outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients, mean age 61.4 years, mean BE length 5.9 cm (range 3-19), underwent APC therapy at four weekly intervals while receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BE margins were marked by India ink tattooing and extent was documented by grid drawings, photography, and 2 cm interval quadrantic jumbo biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty four hour ambulatory oesophageal pH studies were done while on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> before and after APC therapy, and Bilitec <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring after APC completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 68% of patients achieved &gt;90% BE ablation after a median of four APC sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Persistent BE (&gt;10% original BE area) was associated with longer initial BE length despite more APC sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Persistent acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>, although commoner in this group, were not significantly different from those successfully ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 34 patients (44%) with successful macroscopic clearance had buried glands, present in 8.3% of a total of 338 biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the one year follow up, only 32% of those with initial successful ablation showed no recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BE recurred or increased in most with mean segment length increases of 1.1 cm and 1.6 cm, respectively, in patients with previous full ablation and those with persistent BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of buried glands did not predict BE recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients who reduced their <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> dose had significantly greater BE recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: APC is most effective for shorter segment BE ablation but "buried" glands do occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of BE is common at one year, especially in those with initial persistent and/or long segment BE and those who reduce their <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
