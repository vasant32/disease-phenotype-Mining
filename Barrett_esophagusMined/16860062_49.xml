<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The detection of the mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (ie, mucosal and vascular patterns) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) by magnifying (chromo)endoscopy may improve the distinction of high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) from nondysplastic specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Narrow band imaging (NBI) is a new technique that uses optical filters to enhance the mucosal contrast without the need for chromoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To use NBI for the characterization and the classification of the mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in nondysplastic BE and in BE with HGIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Descriptive study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single-center study in a tertiary referral center for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We used NBI with magnifying endoscopy to image and biopsy randomly selected areas in 63 patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A systematic image and a biopsy specimen evaluation process was followed, including unblinded assessment of an exploratory set of images and biopsy specimens, and blinded evaluation of learning and validation sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The relationship between the mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and the presence of SIM and HGIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SIM was characterized by either villous/gyrus-forming patterns (80%), which were mostly regular and had regular vascular patterns, or a flat mucosa with regular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing long branching vessels (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HGIN was characterized by 3 abnormalities: irregular/disrupted mucosal patterns, irregular vascular patterns, and abnormal blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> areas with HGIN had at least 1 abnormality, and 85% had 2 or more abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of abnormalities showed a significant rise with increasing grades of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The magnified NBI images had a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 76%, a positive predictive value of 64%, and a negative predictive value of 98% for HGIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: No data on observer agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NBI with magnification reveals the mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> characteristics of nondysplastic BE and HGIN, without the need for staining and has a relatively high diagnostic value for HGIN when used for targeted detailed examination of areas of interest </plain></SENT>
