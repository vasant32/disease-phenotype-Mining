<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty six surgical specimens of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blocks of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and of non-dysplastic Barrett's mucosa were stained with a polyclonal antibody specific for the intracytoplasmic domain of the c-erbB-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of 66 tumours showed membrane staining for the c-erbB-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The non-dysplastic Barrett's mucosa was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between c-erbB-2 positive and negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with regard to mean age, sex ratio, percentage of alcohol misusers, percentage of smokers, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> differentiation, depth of invasion, lymph node response, and proliferative activity, assessed by the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells positive with the MIB-1 antibody directed against the Ki-67 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> c-erb B2 positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were of Lauren's intestinal type compared with negative c-erbB-2 tumours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with c-erbB-2 positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> had a significantly poorer prognosis than patients with negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> expressing c-erbB-2 found in this study (11%) was similar to that observed in published series of <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>c-erbB-2 protein expression could be an important prognostic indicator in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
