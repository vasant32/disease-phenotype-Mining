<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), targeted endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of visible lesions of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (IMC) is effective, but carries the risk of leaving in place synchronous lesions and Barrett's epithelium with the potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the safety and long-term efficacy of complete Barrett's eradication EMR (CBE-EMR) for the treatment of patients with HGD or IMC, independently of the presence of macroscopically visible lesions or surgical risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 26 consecutive patients with BE and HGD or IMC underwent CBE-EMRs, which were performed with the endoscopic cap suction method and/or a 2.3-mm monofilament mucosectomy snare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic follow up after completion of resection was carried out to assess the rate of residual or recurrent BE with or without HGD or IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 24 patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They underwent a total of 44 EMR sessions with a median of 3 pieces (range 1-8) removed per session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients with immediate <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were successfully managed endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> that was completely resolved with a single endoscopic dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 28 months (range 15-51 months), persistent endoscopic and histologic eradication of BE was demonstrated in 21 patients (87.5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two patients, Barrett's epithelium was detected beneath the neosquamous epithelium 3 months after completion of the resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patient, IMC was found in a nodule seen and removed by EMR at 12-month surveillance endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CBE-EMR is a safe and highly effective long-term treatment that should be offered to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with HGD and IMC </plain></SENT>
