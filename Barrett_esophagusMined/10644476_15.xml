<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether similar results could be demonstrated in the mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eight Swiss-Webster mice were used in this study and were divided into three groups: Group I, 37 mice with esophagojejunostomy; Group II, 39 mice with esophagojejunostomy and the carcinogen N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-N-benzylnitrosamine (MBN); and Group III, 32 mice with MBN alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed after 19 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic and histopathologic examinations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred mice survived and were available for pathologic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic evidence suggested <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 60.6% of mice in Group I, 62.8% of mice in Group II, and 9% of mice in Group III and suggested <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in 3% of mice in Group I, 51.4% of mice in Group II, and 53.1% of mice in Group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic analysis disclosed BE in 42.4% of mice in Group I, 20% of mice in Group II, and 12.5% of mice in Group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> was present in 12.2% of mice in Group I, 54.3% of mice in Group II, and 46.9% of mice in Group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> was present in 6.1% of mice in Group I, 37.1% of mice in Group II, and 12.5% of mice in Group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Esophagojejunostomy plus MBN in the mouse results in BE, BAA, or both in 57.1% of animals, consistent with findings in the rat model after similar interventions </plain></SENT>
