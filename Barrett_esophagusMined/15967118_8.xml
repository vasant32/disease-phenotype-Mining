<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Identification of biomarkers to recognize individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) predisposed to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> is currently a pressing issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We utilized gene expression profiling to compare molecular signatures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus and stomach, BE, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC) to identify such potential biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over 22,000 genes were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarrays on 38 unique <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> Unsupervised and supervised clusterings were performed on a subset of 2849 genes that varied most significantly across the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for two of the significantly differentially expressed gene products was performed on tissue microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised clustering identified two discernable molecular BE profiles, one of which was similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric tissue ("BE1"), and another that was shared by several of the AC specimens ("BE2") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BE1 profile included expression of several genes that have been described as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor genes, most notably trefoil factor 1 (TFF-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BE2 profile included expression of genes previously found overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, such as carboxylesterase-2 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IHC demonstrated the loss of TFF-1 late in the progression of BE to AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-2 as being upregulated in AC documented to have arisen in the presence of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These potential biomarkers, as well as the relative expression of genes from BE1 versus those from BE2, may be validated in the future to aid in risk stratification and guide treatment protocols in patients with BE and associated AC </plain></SENT>
