<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the mucins and trefoil factor family (TFF)-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> that were expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, in order to study changes in protein expression in early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Biopsy specimens of 71 Barrett's oesophagus patients were collected, and sections were stained for secretory mucins by histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed for secretory mucins (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC6), TFFs (TFF1, TFF2, TFF3), and proliferation (Ki67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein expression in the tissue was measured semiquantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MUC5AC and TFF1 showed high levels and strong colocalization in the surface epithelium, whereas MUC6, MUC5B and TFF3 were found in the deeper glandular structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TFF2 was found in both surface and glandular epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The co-ordinate expression patterns of these six markers were similar to gastric antrum epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MUC2 expression was ubiquitously associated with goblet cells within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, occurring in 68% of patients, and was correlated with increasing proliferation in the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> epithelium displayed a secretory phenotype, demonstrating a co-ordinate gastric-type MUC and TFF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When MUC2 expression was more pronounced, the expression patterns of the other MUCs and the TFFs were increasingly disturbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MUC2 expression may constitute a marker for early change in the phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> as a precancerous lesion </plain></SENT>
