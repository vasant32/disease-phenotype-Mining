<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, Barrett's epithelium, and histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa obtained at surgical resection, and gene expression investigated by Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>p53 was overexpressed, relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue from the same patient, in seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and six Barrett's specimens, whereas high levels of H-ras were found in only four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and one Barrett's specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical correlative data were obtained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with a median follow-up of 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Advanced pathologic stage was associated with poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No association was found between gene expression and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients with low p53 and H-ras levels developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> 7 to 12 months following resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that both p53 and ras are implicated in the progression of Barrett's epithelium to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e>, and that further clinical correlative studies are warranted to evaluate potential clinical application for such molecular markers </plain></SENT>
