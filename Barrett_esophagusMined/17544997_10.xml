<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are few long-term follow-up data on adults who had surgery for EA as infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary aims were to evaluate the prevalence of esophageal symptoms and pathology and second to develop recommendations for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a descriptive study of individuals attending a clinic in an adult tertiary referral hospital, established to provide care for adults who had surgery for EA as infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals aged 20 years or older were identified from an existing database and invited by telephone to attend the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty-two patients attended the clinic from 2000-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals were assessed by using a structured questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy was performed in 62 patients because of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reflux symptoms were reported by 83 (63%), including 25 (19%) with severe symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> was reported by 68 patients (52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of those who underwent endoscopy, reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was present in 36 patients (58%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 7 (11%), and strictures in 26 (42%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient was diagnosed with esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Men who were 35 years or older and individuals with severe reflux symptoms were at high risk of having severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reflux symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are common in these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We recommend clinical assessment as adults and upper endoscopy for reflux symptoms or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Transition of young adults from pediatric care to an adult gastroenterology clinic with expertise in EA appears to be highly beneficial </plain></SENT>
