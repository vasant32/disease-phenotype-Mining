<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-fidelity DNA histograms were obtained with image cytometry on sections, and were classified based on DNA index values of the peaks into diploid, mild aneuploid, moderate aneuploid and severe aneuploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> index (HI) representing cells with different DNA content and the 5N exceeding cell fraction were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eighty-seven cases, including 34 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastrointestinal mucosa (control), 66 Barrett's-specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM), 22 low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), 22 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and 43 BAC were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls showed sharp diploid peaks with HI values less than 13, and no 5N exceeding nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SIM showed a spectrum of histograms including diploid, mild aneuploid and moderate aneuploid histograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency and severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> increased with worsening histological grades of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BAC cases were aneuploid, with moderate or severe <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Marked elevated HI values (&gt;20) and 5N exceeding fractions (&gt;5%) were found in 5%, 32%, 50% and 88% of cases with SIM, LGD, HGD and BAC, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high-fidelity DNA histograms suggest that (1) Barrett's SIM may already be dysplastic in nature, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BAC may be markedly aneuploid; and (2) elevated cellular DNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and 5N fractions may be markers of progressive chromosomal changes and 'unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>' that identifies progressive lesions </plain></SENT>
