<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the human gastroesophageal junction, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> is generated luminally through the enterosalivary recirculation of dietary nitrate, and in cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, the site of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> generation could shift to the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate whether exogenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> could promote the development of BE in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> were administered to a rat surgical model of BE, in which the gastroduodenal contents were refluxed into the esophagus to generate exogenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> in the esophagus by the acid-catalyzed chemical reaction between the 2 reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The emergence of BE was evaluated histologically in the early phase (several weeks) after the surgery with or without exogenous nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the histogenesis of BE, CDX2, MUC2 and MUC6 expressions were investigated immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coadministration of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> significantly accelerated the timing of emergence and increased the area of BE compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of either reagent alone did not show any promotive effects on BE formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, the columnar epithelium thus induced was similar to the specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in human BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this animal model study suggest that exogenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> could be involved in the pathogenesis of the columnar transformation of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies in human are warranted </plain></SENT>
