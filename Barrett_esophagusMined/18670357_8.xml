<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to define the zonal DNA content distribution in the basal versus the superficial crypt cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and related neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and five tissue sections of BE patients and 12 gastric tissue section as controls were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin and Feulgen and high-fidelity DNA histograms were generated from whole crypts (n=117) and also separately from the basal and superficial portions of the crypts (n=71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three parameters were analyzed: (1) peak DNA index (DI), classified into diploidy (DI=0.9-1.1) or <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (DI&gt;1.1), the latter of which was further divided into 3 types: mild (DI=1.1-1.3), moderate (DI=1.3-1.8), and severe (DI&gt;1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> index (HI), representing groups of cells with different DNA content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3) Percentage of cells with DI exceeding 5N rate (5N-ER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In full crypts, compared with gastric controls, the prevalence of DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> increased significantly (P&lt;0.01) from nondysplastic BE to basal crypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (BCD), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nondysplastic BE, BCD, and LGD had mostly mild <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, and the majority of HGD and AC had either moderate or severe <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, both HI and 5N-ER increased progressively from BCD and LGD to HGD and AC (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When analyzed separately, the superficial crypt cells were diploid in nondysplastic BE and BCD, but were aneuploid in 50% of LGD and 100% of HGD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, basal crypt cells were aneuploid in 37% of nondysplastic BE, 50% of BCD, 73% of LGD, and 100% of HGD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A similar progressive increase in the HI and 5N-ER values in basal crypt cells was observed with dysplastic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The changes in DNA ploidy profiles of basal crypt cells in BCD and LGD were remarkably similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>, dysplastic changes in BE begin in the basal crypt cells and then extend further up the crypts, and BCD represents a true early form of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> limited to the crypt bases </plain></SENT>
