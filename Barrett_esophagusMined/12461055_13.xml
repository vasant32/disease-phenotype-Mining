<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> surveillance biopsies is a major factor to determine follow up and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has been reported that the reproducibility of the grading system is not optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To compare routine and expert <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> grades in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> surveillance biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate prospectively morphometrical grading support and to assess the pitfalls in its daily application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive biopsies (n = 143) were graded routinely by experienced general surgical pathologists as no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND), indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), and high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two expert gastrointestinal pathologists blindly reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stratification index of nuclei, mean nuclear area, and Ki67area% were assessed routinely according to a strict protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With these features, the previously described morphometrical grade was calculated for each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The grades provided by the experts, surgical pathologists, and morphometry were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The general pathologists graded many more cases as dysplastic than did the experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete agreement between the experts' grades and the original grades was 50 of 143 (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixty four of the 71 original LGDs and 11 of the 23 original HGDs were downgraded by the experts, whereas one LGD was upgraded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 93 of the 143 biopsies, at review pitfalls or special characteristics of a technical nature (tangential cutting, severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> or the squamocylindrical junction very close by, among others) were seen in the part of the biopsy marked as diagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These probably contributed in part to the original overdiagnoses and could have been prevented or corrected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The morphometrical grading model has not been developed to compensate for this; application of the current morphometrical grading method is not allowed and may result in erroneous (usually too high) morphometrical grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In spite of this, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HGDs according to the experts were recognised as such by morphometry, also in these technically less adequate sections or areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, 46% of the experts' downgrades occurred in technically adequate sections and thus were caused by a difference in interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Here, morphometrical support proved to be useful because, in agreement with the experts, it downgraded 51% of the original LGDs, upgraded one of eight NDs to LGD and one of 39 LGDs to HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Experts downgraded a high proportion of biopsies graded as LGDs and HGDs by the surgical pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Morphometrical grading can be used for daily quality control; the results were close to those of the experts and corrected a large number of cases erroneously graded by surgical pathologists </plain></SENT>
