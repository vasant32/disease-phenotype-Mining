<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis is to examine the utility of this examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of clinically significant upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract findings at screening EGD in patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A secondary aim was to determine whether preprocedure symptoms could predict findings at EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated records of patients undergoing EGD prior to bariatric surgery between 2000 and 2005 at the Stanford University Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical, endoscopic, and pathological data were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of endoscopic findings of clinical significance was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred seventy two complete patient records were identified and included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 237 (87%) were female and 197 (72%) were Caucasian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 43 +/- 9.68 years and mean body mass index was 48 +/- 7.95 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 272 patients, 33 (12%) had EGD findings of clinical significance including erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (3.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (3.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcers</z:hpo> (2.9%), erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (1.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo> (0.7%), and gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid</z:hpo> (0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of these 33 patients, 22 (67%) had UGI symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant findings at screening EGD were found in 12% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>While EGD may be low-yield, the findings could be useful in guiding clinical decision making </plain></SENT>
