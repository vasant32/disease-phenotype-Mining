<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected with regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> (HH), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE), reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE) and gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV), prospectively from 1,150 patients who underwent diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of HH, CLE and RE was 14.3% (n=165), 9.5% (n=109) and 13.3% (n=153), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the CLE group, 48 were histologically proven to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> RE patients, 94.8% had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (LA-A and B) and this was associated with younger age, male gender, presence of HH, and grade 3 or 4 gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grades 3 and 4 GEFV were associated with HH, CLE, and RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Substantial proportion of patients with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> has abnormal endoscopic findings around the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
