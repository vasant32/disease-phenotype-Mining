<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Esophageal diseases</z:e> are common in infants and children, and may present with several clinical and pathological aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EE) is characterized by inflammatory, predominantly eosinophilic infiltrate (&gt; or =15 eosinophils per high-power field (HPF)) that is not responsive to acid suppression therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An immunoallergic pathogenesis has been hypothesized, likely related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016470" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">food allergy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathological consequence is the replacement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stratified squamous epithelium by columnar mucosa with goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present 2 children with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016470" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">food allergy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy revealed linear furrows and yellow plaques in the mid-distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both patients histology showed a high number of eosinophils (&gt;30 at HPF) in the mid-distal esophagus and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with goblet cells in distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of EE associated to BE was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Restriction diet was administered to treat EE whereas, in 1 case, laparoscopic fundoplication was performed to treat BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up showed a remission of endoscopic and histological aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The unusual, possibly fortuitous association of EE and BE, two conditions differing in etiopathogenesis, clinical and pathological features, calls for a correct diagnosis to offer suitable treatment and prognosis </plain></SENT>
