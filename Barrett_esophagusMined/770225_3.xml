<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three cases presented with significant esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and one case presented with high <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal panendoscopy was done in each case and multiple biopsies were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biopsies were utilized for histomorphology, pepsinogen agar gel electrophoresis, and tissue gastrin assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue gastrin levels in esophageal mucosa were elevated in 2 cases when compared to controls with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pepsin and acid secretory studies were done by isolating the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was shown to produce pepsin by both chemical studies (2 cases) and agar gel electrophoresis at pH 5.7 (3 cases), and was also shown to produce acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mucosa contained either cathepsin or cathepsin and pepsinogens in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nissen's fundoplication was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 3 patients who were <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, 2 who consented for this operation stopped <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is to be noted that the usual clinical treatment of antacids, bedrest, and raising the head end of the bed failed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The follow-up of 9 months to 3 years postoperatively has shown persistence of Barrett's mucosa with no evidence for any reversion to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal type </plain></SENT>
