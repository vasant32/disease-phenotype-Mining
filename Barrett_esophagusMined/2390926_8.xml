<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on one patient of nine studied with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who had <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 7 and showed increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the protooncogene c-erb-B, which encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, was not amplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, increased expression of the corresponding <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was evident on dot blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding studies were consistent with increased expression of the receptor with approximately 2.3 x 10(5) molecules of EGF bound per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that chromosome 7 abnormalities can occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
