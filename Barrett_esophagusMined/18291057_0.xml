<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine if the relative frequency of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has increased over that of squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, in keeping with the trends noted in other Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the endoscopic esophageal biopsies diagnosed with infiltrating <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) between 1992 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative frequency of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were compared for the periods 1992-1999 and 2000-2006 using the z-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A distribution analysis for age and sex was performed by the chi-square test using a confidence level (alpha) of 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 125 infiltrating squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>/squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> for the entire series was 0.33/0.67; for the period from 1992-1990, 0.28/0.72; and from 2000-2006, 0.38/0.62 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Males constituted 75.6% of the cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 57.1% of the cases of squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>; this difference was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 66.0 years of age for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 67.9 years for squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of infiltrating <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was greater among the men than among the women of the age group under 65 years (P &lt; 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BE was diagnosed at a rate of 6:1 relative to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were predominant among men, though <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was the major part of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The relative frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> rose 10% in the last 7 years of the series compared with the first 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This difference was not significant, but it may signal a general trend similar to that described in other countries </plain></SENT>
