<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there has been no direct evidence that inhibition of COX-2 prevents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of MF-Tricyclic, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, on the development of BE and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four weeks after esophagojejunostomy, 105 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to a chow containing MF-Tricyclic or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">Sulindac</z:chebi>, or a placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six (92%) rats completed the study and were sacrificed at 28 +/- 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were assessed for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume, BE, degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and COX-2 expression and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MF-Tricyclic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">Sulindac</z:chebi> reduced the relative risk of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> by 55% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 43%-66%, P &lt; 0.008) and by 79% (95% CI = 68%-87%, P &lt; 0.001), respectively, compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were noted in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> between the MF-Tricyclic and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">Sulindac</z:chebi> group (P = 0.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume was not significantly different among the 3 groups (P = 0.081) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moderate to severe degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was significantly more common (P = 0.005) in the control compared with the MF-Tricyclic and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">Sulindac</z:chebi> group; however, the prevalence of BE was not significantly different between groups (P = 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rats in the control group had higher tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> level compared with the MF-Tricyclic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">Sulindac</z:chebi> groups (P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Selective and nonselective COX-2 inhibitors can inhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, COX-2 activity, and development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> induced by reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This provides direct evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may have chemopreventive potential in BE </plain></SENT>
