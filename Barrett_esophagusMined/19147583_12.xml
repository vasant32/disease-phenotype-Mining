<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Barrett's epithelium has been reported to be more resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have explored the contribution of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway to apoptotic resistance in non-neoplastic, telomerase-immortalized esophageal squamous (NES) and Barrett's (BAR-T) epithelial cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We exposed these cells to UV-B irradiation in doses known to cause DNA damage and to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, and studied <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as well as the expression of phospho-H2AX, NF-kappaB, Bcl-2, XIAP, cIAP-1, and survivin proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also used Bay 11-7085 and siRNAs to NF-kappaB and Bcl-2 to assess the effects of NF-kappaB and Bcl2 inhibition on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UV-B irradiation at low doses (50 and 100 J/m(2)) caused DNA damage in both NES and BAR-T cells but significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> only in NES cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UV-B irradiation caused a decrease in the levels of NF-kappaB, Bcl-2, cIAP-1, XIAP, and survivin in NES cells but increased the levels of those proteins in BAR-T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resistance of BAR-T cells to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by low-dose UV-B irradiation was abolished by Bay 11-7085 and by siRNA for NF-kappaB and was decreased significantly by siRNA for Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the ability of Barrett's epithelial cells to activate the NF-kappaB pathway when they have sustained DNA damage allows them to resist <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This capacity to avoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> despite genotoxic damage may underlie the persistence and malignant predisposition of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
