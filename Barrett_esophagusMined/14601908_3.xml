<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, new tools have been developed for use in computer-based image processing which have made visualization and quantitation of esophageal bolus transport possible through depiction of the 'topography of transit times' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data extracted from the images obtained in multiple swallowing studies from a single healthy volunteer as well as in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) and from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are compressed, filtered and depicted in quantifiable concise plots or multidimensional images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Profile plots demonstrated a considerable increase in local transit times along the esophagus superimposed, however, by a distinctive pattern of local delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Above the level of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the bolus accumulates in a functional ampulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subprocesses of bolus transit through the LES, disclosed by spatiotemporal enhancement, allow for the differentiation between mass transit of the bolus and closure of the LES which was considerably retarded in the case of the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The image-processing tools developed for topographic visualization of transit times for esophageal bolus transport have greatly improved the extraction and quantifiable depiction of information obtained by scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This can be used for definition of pathognomonic indices </plain></SENT>
