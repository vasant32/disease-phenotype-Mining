<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several types of forceps are available for use in sampling <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few data exist with regard to biopsy quality for histologic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sampling quality of 3 different forceps in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Single-center, randomized clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with BE undergoing upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Patients randomized to have biopsy specimens taken with 1 of 3 types of forceps: standard, large capacity, or jumbo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Specimen adequacy was defined a priori as a well-oriented biopsy sample 2 mm or greater in diameter and with at least muscularis mucosa present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were enrolled and analyzed (standard forceps, n = 21; large-capacity forceps, n = 21; jumbo forceps, n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with jumbo forceps, a significantly higher proportion of biopsy samples with large-capacity forceps were adequate (37.8% vs 25.2%, P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the standard forceps biopsy samples, 31.9% were adequate, which was not significantly different from specimens taken with large-capacity (P = .20) or jumbo (P = .09) forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens taken with jumbo forceps had the largest diameter (median, 3.0 mm vs 2.5 mm [standard] vs 2.8 mm [large capacity]; P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, jumbo forceps had the lowest proportion of specimens that were well oriented (overall P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneous</z:hpo> patient population precluded <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results challenge the requirement of jumbo forceps and therapeutic endoscopes to properly perform the Seattle protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We found that standard and large-capacity forceps used with standard upper endoscopes produced biopsy samples at least as adequate as those obtained with jumbo forceps and therapeutic endoscopes in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
