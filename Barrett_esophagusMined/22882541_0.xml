<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A consecutive series of 275 samples of stomach and oesophagus tissue (representing the whole spectrum of the phenotypic changes involved in gastric and Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HER2 status was assessed by applying two immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocols, using the antibodies 4B5 and CB11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dual-colour silver chromogenic in-situ hybridization (SISH) was also performed on the same tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both oesophageal and gastric samples, the rate of HER2 overexpression rose significantly from low-grade to high-grade IEN to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001), with the two IHC protocols showing consistent staining (consistency 95%; k = 0.78; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intratumour <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was documented in both GC and BAc (using both IHC protocols) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of HER2 amplification (using SISH) increased significantly along with IEN <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither native nor metaplastic mucosa samples (obtained from either stomach or oesophagus) ever showed HER2 amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was excellent agreement between HER2 amplification and protein overexpression (both IHC protocols: SISH/4B5--consistency 97.8%, k = 0.89, P &lt; 0.001; SISH/CB11-consistency 97.8%, k = 0.91, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is early involvement of HER2 dysregulation (amplification and protein overexpression) in both gastric (intestinal-type) and Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
