<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total study population comprised 869 patients who underwent endoscopy during a health checkup at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence and extent of Barrett's epithelium were diagnosed based on the Prague C &amp; M Criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We originally classified cases of Barrett's epithelium into two types based on its shape, namely, flame-like and lotus-like Barrett's epithelium, and into two groups based on its length, its C extent &lt; 2 cm, and &gt; or = 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlation of shape and length of Barrett's epithelium with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed in 374 cases (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of these were diagnosed as short-segment Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was significantly higher in subjects with flame-like than lotus-like Barrett's epithelium, and in those with a C extent of &gt; or = 2 cm than &lt; 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Flame-like rather than lotus-like Barrett's epithelium, and Barrett's epithelium with a longer segment were more strongly associated with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
