<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Higher serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> levels have been associated with a reduced risk of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>; however, their association with the risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a cross-sectional study to investigate the relationship between serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> levels and markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> among persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical history, blood, and esophageal tissue specimens were collected from 399 members of a cohort study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients undergoing endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> levels were measured by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA content of tissue samples was measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 9p and 17p, chromosomal regions which include the p16 and p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors, respectively, was detected by automated fluorescent genotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Persons with serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> levels in the upper three quartiles (i.e., &gt;1.5 micro M) were less likely to have high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (OR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3 to 0.9) or <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2 to 0.8) than those with levels in the lowest quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> levels in the upper three quartiles were associated with similar reductions in risk of 17p (p53) LOH (OR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.2 to 0.9) and increased 4N fraction (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.3 to 1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By contrast, serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> levels were not associated with 9p (p16) LOH (OR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.5 to 1.7), a marker that appears early in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results, from a cross-sectional analysis with biologic markers, suggest that higher serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> levels may be associated with a reduced risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> among persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> was not associated with 9p (p16) LOH, we speculate that <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> may act primarily at later stages of progression toward <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
