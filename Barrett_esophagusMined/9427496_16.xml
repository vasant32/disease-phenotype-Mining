<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional medical or surgical treatments do not consistently lead to a regression of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, restoration of squamous mucosa can occur in an anacid environment after endoscopic ablation of metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here on two patients with long-standing history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who were treated with endoscopic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By six months of endoscopic treatment, Barrett's epithelium had regressed by more than 50%, being replaced by apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extensive histological sampling confirmed the presence of squamous epithelium indistinguishable from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients were asymptomatic under concomitant therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> with the exception of slight retrosternal discomfort the day after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that endoscopic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation may be considered for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
