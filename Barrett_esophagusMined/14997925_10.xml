<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The columnar epithelium may be protective, guarding people afflicted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> from experiencing symptoms related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> subjectively experience fewer symptoms or symptoms of decreased severity, despite sustaining greater acid exposure, than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> but without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a chart review of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Criteria for inclusion in the study were esophagogastroscopy, motility testing and a 24-hour pH study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients (29 men, 29 women) fulfilled these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> was based on an abnormal 24-hour pH study (DeMeester score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 58 patients, 21 (14 men, 7 women) were found to have histologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire to assess the key symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> was administered, with a severity score ranging from 0 to 3 (3 being the most severe) for each symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> experienced symptoms significantly less severe (p &lt; 0.01) than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> also had a greater degree of acid exposure as identified by higher DeMeester scores (p = 0.056), longer episodes of acid exposure, a greater number of long episodes (&gt; 5 min) of acid exposure (p = 0.033) and an increased percentage of time when their pH was less than 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had decreased resting lower esophageal sphincter tone, and number and amplitude of peristaltic contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, the columnar epithelium may serve a protective function in guarding against symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This has implications for the diagnosis and management of this condition </plain></SENT>
