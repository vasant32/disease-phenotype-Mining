<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of an animal model in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is induced by duodeno-(gastro-)<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e> could provide better understanding of the pathogenesis of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence and would create the possibility of investigating new treatment strategies for this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two rat models were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, 44 male Sprague Dawley rats underwent end-to-side esophagojejunostomy with gastric resection, to ensure duodenoesophageal reflux without gastric acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment a side-to-side esophago-gastrojejunostomy was performed in 30 rats, ensuring duodeno-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both experiments animals were not exposed to any exogenous carcinogens during the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequential morphological changes (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) were studied after 4, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To analyze histopathologic characteristics, evaluation of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin specimens was combined with immunohistochemical stainings for high-iron <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15571,23666">diamine</z:chebi>-alcian blue, alcian blue/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff, the proliferation marker PCNA, and mutations in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first experiment, only 11 animals survived the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These animals had to be sacrificed at a median of 11 weeks due to persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001508'>failure to thrive</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severe ulcerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, with a 2-mm segment of metaplastic epithelium found at the anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In four animals a large, well-differentiated, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334811" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mucinous tumor</z:e> without malignant characteristics was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, eight animals died postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twelve animals were sacrificed according to protocol at 4 or 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In these animals, extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> with squamous cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, a short (2 mm) segment of metaplastic epithelium was observed, without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The remaining animals survived 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>After 1 year, 9 of the 10 animals had developed a glandular metaplastic segment (median length, 10 mm), which was histologically and immunohistologically characteristic for the specialized columnar epithelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without signs of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Finally, in seven animals a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334811" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mucinous tumor</z:e> with cytologic characteristics of a well-differentiated mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was found without infiltrative growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were always found at the site of the anastomosis, originated in the submucosa, and did not reach either the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface or the muscular layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The mucinous lesions were not positive for p53, and PCNA was only slightly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Although they showed cytological characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, histopathologic evaluation was more suggestive of a reactive mucous producing lesion fitting the diagnosis "<z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> cystica profunda." CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the development of a long Barrett's segment in an animal duodeno-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334811" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mucinous tumors</z:e> resembling <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> develop around the anastomosis, these are probably not reflux induced and are more likely to be reactive lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, the true nature of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
