<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of these conditions according to time and to the route of esophageal reconstruction after esophagectomy remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify any changes and differences of the incidence of RE and CLE in patients who underwent gastric tube reconstruction after esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A hundred patients who underwent cervical esophagogastrostomy after resection of the thoracic esophagus were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed their endoscopic findings at 1 month, at 1 year and at 2 years after surgery, and compared the incidence rates of RE and CLE with the passage of time and among the three reconstruction routes; a subcutaneous route, a retrosternal route, and a posterior mediastinal route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of RE was 42%, 37% and 38%, at 1 month, 1 year and at 2 years after surgery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the incidence of RE according to the time after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of severe RE (Grade C and D in the Los Angeles Classification) was 9% percent at 1 month after surgery, 18% at 1 year after surgery and 22% at 2 years after surgery, significantly increasing with passage of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of CLE was 0% at 1 month after surgery, 14% at 1 year after surgery and 40% at 2 years after surgery, significantly increasing with passage of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed in the incidence of RE and that of CLE among the three routes of esophageal reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severe RE and CLE increase with passage of time after cervical esophagogastrostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, careful endoscopic follow-up is necessary for such patients irrespective of the route of esophageal reconstruction </plain></SENT>
