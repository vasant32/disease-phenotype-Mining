<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) is rising in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important risk factor for EAC is the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BE is the replacement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal epithelium with a specialized columnar epithelium in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the emergence of BE from squamous keratinocytes has not yet been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our research has focused on this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wnt and cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2) are two pathways whose activation has been associated with BE and progression to EAC, but their role has not been tested experimentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To explore their contribution, we engineered a human esophageal keratinocyte cell line to express either a dominant-active Wnt effector CatCLef or a Cox2 complementary DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a two-dimensional culture environment, Cox2 expression increases cell proliferation and migration, but neither transgene induces known BE markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when these cells were placed into three-dimensional organotypic culture conditions, we observed more profound effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CatCLef-expressing cells were more proliferative, developed a thicker epithelium, and upregulated Notch signaling and several BE markers including NHE2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cox2 expression also <z:mp ids='MP_0000351'>increased cell proliferation</z:mp> and induced a thicker epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More importantly, we observed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> form within the epithelium, filled with intestinal mucins including Muc5B and Muc17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that Cox2 expression in a three-dimensional culture environment induces a lineage of mucin-secreting cells and supports an important causal role for Cox2 in BE pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in vitro modeling of BE pathogenesis can be improved by enhancing Wnt signaling and Cox2 activity and using three-dimensional organotypic culture conditions </plain></SENT>
