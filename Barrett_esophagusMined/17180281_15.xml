<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the optimal treatment parameters for the ablation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) containing high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) using a balloon-based ablation system for patients undergoing esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immediately before esophagectomy, patients underwent ablation of circumferential segments of the esophagus containing IM-HGD using the HALO360 system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment settings were randomized to 10, 12, or 14 J/cm2 for two, three, or four applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After esophagectomy, multiple sections from ablation zones were microscopically evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologic end points included maximum ablation depth (histologic layer) and complete ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IM-HGD (yes/no) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight men with a mean age of 57 years (range, 45-71 years) were treated, and 10 treatment zones were created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no device-related adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At resection, there was no evidence of a transmural thermal effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grossly, ablation zones were clearly demarcated sections of ablated epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The maximum ablation depth was the lamina propria or muscularis mucosae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest energy (14 J/cm2, 4 applications) incurred <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the superficial submucosa, but no submucosa ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete ablation of IM and HGD occurred in 9 of 10 ablation zones (90%), defined as complete removal of the epithelium with only small foci of "ghost cells" representing nonviable, ablated IM-HGD and demonstrating loss of nuclei and cytoarchitectural derangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One focal area of viable IM-HGD remained at the margin of one ablation zone (12 J/cm2, 2 applications) because of incomplete overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Complete ablation of IM-HGD without ablation of submucosa is possible using the HALO360 system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ablation depth is dose related and limited to the muscularis mucosae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In one patient, small residual foci of IM-HGD at the edge of the ablation zone were attributable to incomplete overlap, which can be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This study, together with nonesophagectomy IM-HGD trials currently underway, will identify the optimal treatment parameters for IM-HGD patients who would otherwise undergo esophagectomy or photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
