<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is present in the whole world population, especially frequent in the developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It evolves from pathological reflux which exposes the esophagus to the gastric contents which must overcome esophageal defense system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many factors have been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>; the most important one is the relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intensity of the disease is proportional to the amount of gastric contents refluxing from the stomach and the duration of esophageal exposure to this contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is currently in the spotlight because of its special significance in the development of very specific disease in the lower part of the esophagus--<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, as well as esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> which has lately been increasing in prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Today, unrecognized and inadequately cured <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is known to be a high risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In recent years the relation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> has been the topic of investigation by many prominent researchers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is based on inhibition of acid secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are many different therapeutic agents available, however, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) are considered to be the most effective in the treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
