<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is widely believed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms are caused by acid refluxate within the esophagus, so ambulatory 24 hour pH-monitoring became the gold standard in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Traditional ambulatory pH monitoring is unable to detect a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> with pH &gt;4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The introduction of multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH (MII-pH) brought new possibilities in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this technique impedance identifies reflux episode whereas pH sensor further characterizes it as either acid (pH &lt;4) or non-acid (pH &gt; or =4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is a great progress in diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> but MII has also some imperfections related to pathological changes in the esophageal mucosa such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or Barrett oesophagus, which are connecting with a very low baseline impedance values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in the esophageal mucosa may also impair the esophageal motility and esophageal transit leading to some fluid retention in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It should be stressed that very low impedance baseline creates a difficulty in interpreting the MII-pH study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In such a case it might be almost impossible to interpret the study as the interpreter does not see characteristic drop in impedance progressing either orally (reflux episode) or swallow but only almost flat impedance lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, future studies are needed to further evaluate this problem </plain></SENT>
