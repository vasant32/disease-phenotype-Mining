<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were studied prospectively as part of a surveillance programme; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> initially received standard conservative treatment including high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37961">H2-receptor antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A satisfactory initial response was seen in 21 patients, but in 24 the symptoms were unchanged or progressed; 19 patients in the latter group were considered suitable for antireflux surgery and underwent fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of heartburn or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> persisted or recurred in 88 per cent of patients receiving medical treatment alone and complications developed in 38 per cent, including nine strictures and one <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients undergoing antireflux surgery, symptoms persisted or recurred in 21 per cent and complications developed in 16 per cent (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete regression of Barrett's CLO occurred in two patients (11 per cent) after antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest the superiority of antireflux surgery over pharmacological acid suppression in the control of symptoms and prevention of complications in patients with Barrett's CLO </plain></SENT>
