<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to derive health state utilities for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> heartburn symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a custom-designed computer program in order to elicit utilities with the time-tradeoff and standard-gamble techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (more than 6 months) symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two interviews were performed in random sequence either initially on medications for heartburn that adequately controlled symptoms, or off of medications for 1 wk while the patient was symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also collected data using visual-analog scales, quality of life in reflux and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> (QOLRAD), and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We invited 222 patients to participate; 158 (71%) patients (129 men, 29 women) completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was present in 40 (25%), erosive disease in 17 (11%), and 118 (74%) had comorbid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/-SD) utility ratings were 0.94 +/- 0.09 on medical therapy and 0.90 +/- 0.12 off medications for patients with reflux alone using time tradeoff (p= 0.004), and 0.94 +/- 8.0 both on and off of antireflux medications with standard-gamble assessment (p= 0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean time-tradeoff scores were also significantly lower off of medications for patients with other comorbid conditions (p= 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between mean utility scores for patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or erosive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> adversely affects health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Time-tradeoff utility for patients with reflux disease is substantially higher when patients are on medication than off medications </plain></SENT>
