<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since acid is a major component of refluxate, we investigated its effects ex vivo on cell differentiation as determined by villin expression; and on cell proliferation, as determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53526">tritiated thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To mimic known physiological conditions, endoscopic biopsies of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, BE, and duodenum were exposed, in organ culture, to acidified media (pH 3-5) either continuously, or as a 1-h pulse and compared with exposure to pH 7.4 for up to 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before culture, villin expression was noted in 25% of BE samples, and increased after 6 or 24 h of continuous acid to 50% or 83% of BE samples, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased villin expression correlated with ultrastructural maturation of the brush border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an acid-pulse followed by culture at pH 7.4, did not alter villin expression in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, continuous acid exposure blocked cell proliferation in BE, whereas, an acid-pulse enhanced cell proliferation, as compared to pH 7.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on our ex vivo findings, we propose a model in which the diverse patterns of acid exposure in vivo may contribute to the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and unpredictable progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of BE </plain></SENT>
