<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its role in the transition from preinvasive to invasive disease is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017185" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal tumors</z:e> have clearly defined premalignant stages, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is an ideal research model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Supervised clustering of gene expression profiles from microdissected stroma identified a gene signature that could distinguish between BE <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EAC patients overexpressing any of the five genes (TMEPAI, JMY, TSP1, FAPalpha, and BCL6) identified from this stromal signature had a significantly poorer outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene ontology analysis identified a strong inflammatory component in BE disease progression, and key pathways included cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and TGF-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased protein levels of inflammatory-related genes significantly up-regulated in EAC compared with preinvasive stages were confirmed in the stroma of independent samples, and in vitro assays confirmed functional relevance of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene set enrichment analysis of external datasets demonstrated that the stromal signature was also relevant in the preinvasive to invasive transition of the stomach, colon, and pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data implicate inflammatory pathways in the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal tract cancers</z:e>, which can affect prognosis </plain></SENT>
