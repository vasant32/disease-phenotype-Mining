<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 185 patients with pT1 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> treated by esophagectomy without induction therapy were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Depth of invasion was subdivided into invasion into the lamina propria (LP), into the inner muscularis mucosae, between the inner and outer muscularis mucosae, and into the outer muscularis mucosae (OMM), with comparison with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> invading the inner one third of the submucosa (SM-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics were compared among the 5 groups using the Ï‡ test or the Kruskal-Wallis test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognostic effect of depth of invasion on survival was assessed with Cox proportional hazards analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Depth of invasion was LP (n=68), inner muscularis mucosae (n=38), BMM (n=11), OMM (n=33), and SM-1 (n=35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in sex or age among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of 150 patients with intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (0.7%; LP, pN2) and 3 of 35 patients with SM-1 (8.6%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pN1) had nodal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in survival among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Depth of invasion relative to the duplicated muscularis mucosae for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> restricted to the mucosal compartment does not affect survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>-related superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with SM-1 tumor had survival similar to those patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion into the OMM </plain></SENT>
