<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Unsedated esophagoscopy with small-diameter endoscopes is generally well tolerated but of limited sensitivity for the diagnosis of esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucosal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the sensitivity of esophagoscopy performed with new 4-mm diameter prototype battery-powered and video endoscopes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient tolerance for an unsedated examination with the 4-mm endoscopes was assessed and the performance characteristics of the battery-powered and video 4-mm endoscopes were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients referred for EGD were recruited to undergo an additional examination with a 4-mm endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A prototype 60-cm long, 4-mm diameter battery-powered fiberoptic esophagoscope was used in the first 24 patients and a prototype 60-cm long, 4-mm diameter video esophagoscope in the next 27 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examiners who were unaware of patient history and procedure indications recorded esophageal findings, ease of intubation, optical quality (5-point visual scale), and time for examination of the esophagus and then recorded esophageal findings after the standard EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was 100%; overall sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity for detecting esophageal lesions were, respectively, 91%, 98%, and 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient tolerance (assessed by symptom scores for <z:mp ids='MP_0003298'>choking</z:mp>, pain, and discomfort) and acceptability of unsedated esophagoscopy with the 4-mm diameter instruments were significantly better than in a historical group of patients examined with a 3-mm diameter endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The optical quality of video endoscope was rated as superior to that of battery-powered endoscope, and esophageal examination was performed significantly quicker with the video versus the battery-powered endoscope (68 vs. 137 seconds; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unsedated esophagoscopy with 4-mm diameter endoscopes may be an alternative to EGD for screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the current state of endoscopic technology, a minimum diameter of 4 mm is required for satisfactory esophageal imaging </plain></SENT>
