<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The optimal management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, a precursor to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current therapy includes surveillance and ablative or resection techniques of varying safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the feasibility of a new catheter-based, endoscopic water jet ablation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A high-pressure flexible catheter that can be passed through the working port of a standard gastroscope was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The catheter had micro-drilled holes on one side near the tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 1-cm water jet was delivered under foot pedal control and endoscopic view at pressures adjusted from 150 to 400 psi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After approval from the authors' Institutional Review Board, tissue segments from fresh esophagectomy specimens were ablated by the catheter without use of an endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using gross appearance and histologic analysis, variable ablation pressures and times were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using variable pressures and times, 11 ablation sessions were performed: 5 for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, 4 for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stomach, and 2 across the gastroesophageal junction in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ablation pressures of 150 to 300 psi for 30 to 60 s resulted in selective ablation of mucosa with preservation of the submucosa and muscularis propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The depth of the ablation was determined by gross inspection at the time of ablation and confirmed by histologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no embedding of epithelial cells in the muscularis propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In a single <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus specimen, a jet applied at 400 psi for 120 s in a confined area resulted in gross <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Selective ablation of esophageal and gastric epithelium using a catheter-based water jet ablation technique is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The preliminary data from this study investigating a nonendoscopic technique show that the mucosa can be removed with preservation of the underlying submucosa and muscular layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted that focus on defining more precisely the pressure and duration required for optimal results and the practical application of this technique endoscopically </plain></SENT>
