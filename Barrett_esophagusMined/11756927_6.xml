<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it may be difficult and time consuming to obtain acoustic coupling with these devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test a novel catheter US technique for staging superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients underwent examination with a 2-channel endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>US images were obtained with a catheter US probe (20 MHz) fitted with a balloon sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adequate endoscopic and catheter US images were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion as determined with the catheter US probe was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients who underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No procedure-related complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: US with a catheter US probe and sheath allows complete endoscopic examination and preoperative determination of depth of invasion of superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> in a single endoscopic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results suggest this technique is accurate and safe </plain></SENT>
