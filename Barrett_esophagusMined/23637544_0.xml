<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) achieve symptom control on once-daily <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy, but approximately 20%-30% require twice-daily dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were ≥18 years of age with at least one medical claim for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and at least two <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> claims from HealthCore's Integrated Research Database (HIRD(SM)) during 2004-2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were continuously eligible for 12 months before and after the index date (date of first <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> claim) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> dosing throughout the post-index period (quantity of medication dispensed/number of days supply), patients were classified as once-daily (dose ≤ 1.5 pills per day) or twice-daily (≥1.5) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study cohort included 248,386 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (mean age 52.8 ± 13.93 years, 56% females) of whom 90% were once-daily and 10% were twice-daily <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index for once-daily and twice-daily <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> users was 0.70 ± 1.37 and 0.89 ± 1.54, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More once-daily patients had claims for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (5% versus 2%, P &lt; 0.0001) than twice-daily patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-index, higher proportions of twice-daily patients had at least one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-related inpatient visit (7% versus 5%), outpatient visit (60% versus 49%), and office visit (48% versus 38%) versus once-daily patients (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean total <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-related health care costs were $2065 ± $6636 versus $3749 ± $11,081 for once-daily and twice-daily <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> users, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients receiving twice-daily <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy were likely to have more comorbid conditions and greater health care utilization and overall costs compared with patients using once-daily <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
