<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We wanted to determine factors affecting survival rates of benefits to, and complications in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> treated with photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1982 to January 1994, we used photodynamic therapy to treat 77 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> and evaluated survival to July 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had failed, refused, or were ineligible for surgical intervention, ionizing radiation therapy, or chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The only significant variable affecting survival was clinical stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival after photodynamic therapy was as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 6.3 months (mean survival, 9.2 months); stage I, not reached; stage II, 12 months; stage III, 6.2 months; and stage IV, 3.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For stages III and IV, a Karnofsky performance status of 70 or higher had a significant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For stage III, the median survival was 6.3 months when the Karnofsky performance status was equal to or greater than 70 and 3.5 months when it was less than 70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For stage IV, the median survival was 5.5 months when the Karnofsky performance status was equal to or greater than 70 and 2.5 months when it was lower than 70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven stage I patients with no treatment prior to photodynamic therapy had an estimated 5-year survival rate of 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients with stage I invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and Barrett's mucosa diagnosed when they underwent endoscopy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> were alive with no evidence of disease 17, 44, and 59 months after photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> caused minimal complications and no procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy can be considered an alternative treatment for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or patients with stage I <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> who are under consideration for operation but are high surgical risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The length of palliation for patients having "noncurative" treatment was equal to or better than that reported historically for most other treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
