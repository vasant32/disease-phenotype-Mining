<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data from a UK registry that follows outcomes of patients with BE who have undergone RFA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected data on 335 patients with BE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (72% with HGD, 24% with intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, 4% with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (mean age, 69 y; 81% male), treated at 19 centers in the UK from July 2008 through August 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean length of BE segments was 5.8 cm (range, 1-20 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' nodules were removed by EMR, and the patients then underwent RFA every 3 months until <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas of BE were ablated or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were collected 12 months after the first RFA; clearance of HGD (CR-HGD), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (CR-D), and BE (CR-BE) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HGD was cleared from 86% of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from 81%, and BE from 62% at the 12-month time point, following a mean 2.5 RFA procedures (range 2-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CR-D was 15% less likely for every 1 cm increment in BE length (odds ratio, 1.156; standard error, 0.048; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.26; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EMR before RFA did not provide any benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (3%) had developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> by the 12-month time point, and disease had progressed in 17 patients (5.1%) after a median follow-up time of 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic strictures developed in 9% of patients, which were treated by endoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nineteen months after therapy began, 94% of patients remain clear of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We analyzed data from a large series of patients in the UK who underwent RFA for BE-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, and found that by 12 months after treatment, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was cleared from 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Shorter segments BE respond better to RFA </plain></SENT>
