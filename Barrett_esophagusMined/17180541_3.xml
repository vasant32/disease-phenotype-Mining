<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to establish a correlation between these factors and their involvement in the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcers</z:hpo> for which a canonical correlation analysis was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included 7,014 patient records (48.6% women, 18.4% <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>], 4.6% <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcer</z:hpo> [GU]) of those underwent upper gastroendoscopy for the last 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The variables measured are endoscopic findings (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>, GU, antral <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1277259" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pangastritis</z:e>, pyloric deformity, bulbar deformity, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, Barret esophagus and gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>) and risk factors (age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo>, smoking, alcohol, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>] and aspirin intake) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> had significant positive correlation with bulbar deformity (P=2.6 x 10(-23)), pyloric deformity (P=2.6 x 10(-23)), gender (P=2.6 x 10(-23)), H. pylori (P=1.4 x 10(-15)), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (P=6.9 x 10(-15)), smoking (P=1.4 x 10(-7)), aspirin use (P=1.1 x 10(-4)), alcohol intake (P=7.7 x 10(-4)), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> (P=.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GU had a significantly positive correlation with pyloric deformity (P=1,6 x 10(-15)), age (P=2.6 x 10(-14)), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (P=3.7 x 10(-8)), gender (P=1.3 x 10(-7)), aspirin use (P=1.1 x 10(-6)), bulbar deformity (P=7.4 x 10(-4)), alcohol intake (P=.03), smoking (P=.04), and Barret esophagus (P=.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of significance was much higher in some variables with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> than with GU and the correlations with GU in spite of being highly significant the majority, were small in magnitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Turkish patients with the following endoscopic findings bulbar deformity and pyloric deformity are high-risk patients for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcers</z:hpo> with the risk of the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> being higher than that of GU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors such as H. pylori, smoking, alcohol use, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> use (listed in a decreasing manner) are risk factors that have significant impact on the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>; aspirin has a significant impact on both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> and GU </plain></SENT>
