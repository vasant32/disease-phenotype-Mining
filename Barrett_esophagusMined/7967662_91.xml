<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The value of endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and the appropriate management of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients who were referred from endoscopic surveillance programs for management of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> developing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were compared with 35 patients who had a newly recognized Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, who had not been in a surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The referral diagnosis in the surveyed group was <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in six and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After repeat endoscopy with aggressive biopsy, two additional patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the nine patients who underwent esophagectomy for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, five had invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the esophagectomy specimen, which had been missed before the operation, despite the fact that the median number of biopsy specimens obtained per 2 cm of Barrett's mucosa was 7.8 (range 1.5 to 15.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 13 patients in the surveyed group had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 12 staged early and one staged intermediate by the WNM classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surveyed patients were operated on at an earlier stage than the nonsurveyed patients (10 early, 14 intermediate, and 11 late stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; chi 2 = 15.6, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 13 of the 17 surveyed patients, their survival was significantly better than that of the nonsurveyed group (chi 2 = 5.8, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients referred from surveillance programs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have a better outcome and earlier stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> than nonsurveyed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inasmuch as multiple biopsy procedures do not exclude the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, continued surveillance of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is dangerous and potentially destructive to surveillance efforts </plain></SENT>
