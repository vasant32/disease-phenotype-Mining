<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oesophageal mucosa was studied from 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophageal disease</z:e> who had been treated by oesophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis showed a range of oesophageal pathology - 18 patients had gastric type Barrett's mucosa, 18 had intestinal type Barrett's mucosa, and 14 had oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sections were stained immunohistochemically for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (an index of cellular proliferation) and TGF alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCNA immunostaining was seen mainly in the basal cells of the neck/foveolar epithelial compartment of the glands in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in mucosa with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the proliferative compartment extended upwards into the superficial layers of the glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At least 2000 cells were counted in each patient to determine the proportion with PCNA immunoreactivity (PCNA labelling index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The labelling index was highest in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (25%) and in Barrett's intestinal type mucosa with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (26%) compared with intestinal type mucosa with no significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (20%) and Barrett's gastric type mucosa (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive correlation between PCNA labelling indices and TGF alpha expression in Barrett's mucosa (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In glands showing high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, TGF alpha immunoreactivity was seen in the same regions of the glands as PCNA immunoreactivity, indicating the possibility of involvement of TGF alpha in (pre) neoplastic proliferation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
