<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these techniques have been abandoned because they lack long-term efficacy or have serious side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a recently published prospective randomized, sham-controlled trial, the Plicator was shown to be effective at controlling reflux symptoms and esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previous studies, only a single implant was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present pilot study was to determine the safety and efficacy of two serially placed Plicator implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients requiring maintenance therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) were enrolled in this single-center pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received two Plicator implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> larger than 3 cm, grade IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal motility disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary study end point was at least 50 % improvement in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> medication use, esophageal acid exposure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> grade, and heartburn/regurgitation scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients underwent endoscopic full-thickness plication using two serially placed Plicator implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 6 months after treatment, the proportion of patients achieving at least 50 % improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-HRQL score was 68 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complete cessation of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment was achieved in 59 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In pH studies conducted at 6 months (n = 29), median percentage of time for which pH was below 4 decreased by 36 %, with 28 % of patients experiencing pH normalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no serious adverse events requiring intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic full-thickness plication using two serially placed Plicator implants was both safe and effective in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, medication use, and esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
