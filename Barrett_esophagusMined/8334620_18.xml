<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improvement in therapy awaits better understanding of the biologic behavior of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Establishment of cell lines permits detailed analysis of the biology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors report on the establishment and characterization of five cell lines arising from primary proximal gastric and distal esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cultures of epithelial cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the proximal stomach or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the lower esophagus were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>Gastric cancer</z:hpo> cell lines were analyzed for doubling times, anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenic and metastatic potential in nu/nu mice, expression of keratin proteins by indirect immunofluorescence, invasive potential in a Boyden Chamber, and growth factor production by reverse transcription of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in cDNA and subsequent amplification by the polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five cell lines were derived from primary <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the proximal stomach and from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five cell lines were tumorigenic but not metastatic in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None were capable of anchorage independent growth in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two lines were highly invasive in the Boyden chamber assay, whereas two lines were minimally or noninvasive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five cell lines expressed <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcripts specific for the growth factors TGF beta 1, TGF beta 2, TGF beta 3, TGF alpha, and platelet-derived growth factor A, whereas subsets of cell lines expressed transcripts for aFGF, bFGF, FGF-5, Hst, and platelet-derived growth factor B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Five cell lines derived from primary gastric-esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were established in tissue culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These cell lines show differences in morphologic features, growth potential, and invasiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These newly established <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> cell lines should prove useful for a wide range of studies attempting to decipher the biology of proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
