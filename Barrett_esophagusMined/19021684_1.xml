<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether the overall survival (OS) of patients with localized esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (LEA) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) (Barrett's-positive) and those with LEA without BE (Barrett's-negative) following preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> is different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the published differences in the molecular biology of the two entities, we hypothesized that the two groups will have a different clinical biology (and OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with LEA had surgery following preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from age, gender, baseline clinical stage, location, class of cytotoxics, post-therapy stage, and OS, LEAs were divided up into Barrett's-positive and Barrett's-negative groups based on histologic documentation of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analytic methods were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 362 patients with LEA (137 Barrett's-positive and 225 Barrett's-negative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A higher proportion of Barrett's-positive patients had (EUS)T2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (27%) than those with Barrett's-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More Barrett's-negative LEAs involved gastroesophageal junction than Barrett's-positive ones (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The OS was significantly shorter for Barrett's-positive patients than that for Barrett's-negative patients (32 months vs. 51 months; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis for OS, Barrett's-positive LEA (P = 0.006), old age (P = 0.016), baseline positive nodes (P = 0.005), more than 2 positive (yp)N (P = 0.0001), higher (yp)T (P = 0.003), and the use of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxane</z:chebi> (0.04) were the independent prognosticators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that the clinical biology (reflected in OS) is less favorable for patients with Barrett's-positive LEA than for patients with Barrett's-negative LEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our intriguing findings need confirmation followed by in-depth molecular study to explain these differences </plain></SENT>
