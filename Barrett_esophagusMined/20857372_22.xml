<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The AIM-II Trial included patients with nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (NDBE) treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete eradication of NDBE (complete response-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> [CR-IM]) was achieved in 98.4 % of patients at 2.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the proportion of patients demonstrating CR-IM at 5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, multicenter US trial (NCT00489268) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After endoscopic RFA of NDBE up to 6 cm, patients with CR-IM at 2.5 years were eligible for longer-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 5 years, we obtained four-quadrant biopsies from every 1 cm of the original extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> specimens were reviewed by one expert gastrointestinal pathologist, followed by focal RFA and repeat biopsy if NDBE was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were (i) proportion of patients demonstrating CR-IM at 5-year biopsy, and (ii) proportion of patients demonstrating CR-IM at 5-year biopsy or after the single-session focal RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 60 eligible patients, 50 consented to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 1473 esophageal specimens obtained at 5 years 85 % contained lamina propria or deeper tissue (per patient, mean 30 , standard deviation [SD] 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CR-IM was demonstrated in 92 % (46 / 50) of patients, while 8 % (4 / 50) had focal NDBE; focal RFA converted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these to CR-IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no buried glands, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, strictures, or serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier CR-IM survival analysis showed probability of maintaining CR-IM for at least 4 years after first durable CR-IM was 0.91 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.77 - 0.97) and mean duration of CR-IM was 4.22 years (standard error [SE] 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NDBE treated with RFA, CR-IM was demonstrated in the majority of patients (92 %) at 5-year follow-up, biopsy depth was adequate to detect recurrence, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> failures (4 / 4, 100 %) were converted to CR-IM with single-session focal RFA </plain></SENT>
