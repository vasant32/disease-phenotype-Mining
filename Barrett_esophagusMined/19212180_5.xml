<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Esophagectomy with gastric interposition creates an in vivo human model of pathologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e> with the potential for long-term reflux disease complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-four esophagectomy patients were assessed over time by symptoms, endoscopy and biopsies of their esophageal remnant after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anastomosis was in the right upper chest (n = 36) or in a left cervical position (n = 48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual quantification of damage, details of histopathology, and time period since surgery were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (81%) with a right chest reconstruction had reflux symptoms when compared with 25 patients (53%) with a neck reconstruction (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visualized reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was observed in 31 patients (81%) with chest anastomoses and in 22 patients (46%) with cervical anastomoses (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Documented mucosal damage and columnar lined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> were significantly more frequent in the chest anastomosis group than the cervical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mucosal damage and columnar lined metaplastic-free evolution were 13 +/- 3 and 20.5 +/- 6 months for the intrathoracic anastomosis, and 22 +/- 6 months and 40 +/- 8 months for the cervical anastomosis (P = 0.087) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two factors affecting the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> were included in the multivariate analysis: an intrathoracic anastomosis (P = 0.018) and the presence of a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (P = 0.064) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When a gastric transplant is used after esophagectomy, a high prevalence of mucosal damage is observed in the esophageal remnant independently of the level of reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A left cervical anastomosis favors less reflux symptoms, less visualized damage, and delays the development of mucosal damage over time </plain></SENT>
