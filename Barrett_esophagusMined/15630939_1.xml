<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the esophageal mucosa has been shown to be a precursor to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to esophagectomy, multiple ablative endoscopic techniques have evolved for the management of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a surgical alternative to esophagectomy, we describe for the first time a new option in the treatment of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which demonstrated high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first patient had a short segment (0.5-1.0 cm), and the second patient had a longer (2 cm) segment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient is placed in the modified lithotomy position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five trocars are placed as if to perform a fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A complete circumferential mobilization of the esophagus is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The short gastric vessels are divided with the harmonic scalpel, to free up the fundus of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An anterior horizontal gastrotomy is performed three to four centimeters below the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A solution of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (1:100,000) is injected into the mucosa at the Z-line and, utilizing specially designed hook electrocautery, the mucosa is incised circumferentially around a lighted bougie </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using blunt dissection the mucosa is undermined, elevated, and excised in four quadrants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three centimeters of the distal esophageal mucosa are resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The gastrotomy is then closed using a linear stapler, and a 360 degrees fundoplication is performed around a 50 Fr bougie </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was identified in the specimens from both patients; however, neither patient was found to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ or invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our first patient has been followed for twenty months, the second for ten months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Both patients underwent routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for surveillance of the healing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>At eight months, the mucosa of the first patient showed complete regeneration of squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our most recent patient appears to be progressing without complications and has also demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium at ten months postoperatively, without changes of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The technique of laparoscopic transgastric esophageal mucosal resection is feasible and may be proven to be an alternative to esophagectomy for the management of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
