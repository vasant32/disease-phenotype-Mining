<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Still, there is controversy on the role of weakly acidic and weakly alkaline reflux in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To compare characteristics of reflux episodes patients with BE, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EE), and healthy volunteers (HV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with BE (75 short-segment BE, 25 long-segment BE), 50 with EE and 48 HV underwent multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH off-therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We quantified esophageal acid exposure, characteristics, and proximal extension of reflux episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Total and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> episodes gradually increased from HV [28 (17.5-43) and 18 (8-31)] to EE [73.5 (54-96) and 52 (39-68)], short-segment BE (SSBE) [83 (73.2-131) and 65 (43.3-95)] and long-segment BE (LSBE) [105 (102-187) and 77 (75-107)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Weakly acidic reflux episodes were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in LSBE [36 (27.5-50.5)] and SSBE [34 (18.5-41)] compared to EE [21.5 (15-37)] and HV [19 (14-25)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in terms of proportion of acid, weakly acidic and weakly alkaline reflux were found [HV (49%-49%-2%) vs EE (68%-32%-1%) vs SSBE (65%-34%-1%) vs LSBE (69%-30%-1%); P = ns] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In LSBE, a higher percentage of reflux episodes (P &lt; 0.05) reached the proximal esophagus (59%) compared with SSBE (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS &amp; INFERENCES:  <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> patients have more severe reflux as shown by the number of acid and weakly acidic reflux episodes, re-reflux episodes and proximal migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> change only the pH of the refluxate, the role of weakly acidic reflux in Barrett's patients on acid suppressive therapy warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
