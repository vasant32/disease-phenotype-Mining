<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To audit whether our patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) enter into our endoscopic surveillance programme and whether they continue with it after entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have determined the incidence of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> among our surveyed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We retrospectively audited prospectively collected data from our BO surveillance programme over the years 1987-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: An inner city teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During these years, 466 patients with BO were diagnosed (392 long segment, &gt;or=3 cm), 29 had oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at diagnosis, 232 [195 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) on biopsy] had at least one follow-up endoscopy, and 205 have not been re-endoscoped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 27 out of 205 no IM was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 178 out of 205 with IM, 30 were within 2 years of diagnosis and 148 have not been re-endoscoped for the following reasons: age (51), non-attendance (35), not referred back by general practitioner (30), non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> (14), severe concurrent illness (12), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (three), refused follow-up (two), left the area (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 195 patients with IM who entered endoscopic surveillance consisted of 108 men and 87 women (aged 62.9 years, range 31-96), were followed for a total of 1068 patient-years (average 5.5 years), and had 556 endoscopies (average 2.9 per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven out of 195 patients remain under active endoscopic surveillance but 98 discontinued for the following reasons: age (31), non attendance (21), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (21 including one from oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>), refused follow up (seven), concurrent illness (six), left the area (four), no IM on repeat biopsies (three) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 195 patients with IM, four developed low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, two high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and four <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (incidence 0.37%); 178 out of 195 have been maintained on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with BO either do not enter or do not continue in an endoscopic surveillance programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This needs to be acknowledged when the workload and cost of BO surveillance programmes are considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was low compared with many published series, and we speculate whether this is the result of maintenance <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
