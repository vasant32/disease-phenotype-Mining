<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Of 262 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus or cardia seen at the Lahey Clinic between January 1970 and January 1983, 209 (79.8%) underwent surgical exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report is confined to the 167 operations performed in the division of the senior author </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Half of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> involved the esophagogastric junction with nearly equal numbers being located in the lower and upper halves of the thoracic esophagus and a relatively small number involving the cervical esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority were <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of which 20 developed in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137,C0751688" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous cell cancers</z:e> developed in an achalasic esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 94 were classified as Stage III, 18 as Stage II, and 37 as Stage I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy is the procedure of choice regardless of the level of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 167 patients, 149 (89.2%) underwent resection with two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> within 30 days of operation for a hospital mortality rate of 1.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 22 major complications (14.9%), which prolonged the hospital stay, and 14 minor complications (9.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory palliation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was achieved in 82.7% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall adjusted survival rate at 5 years was 21.7% +/- 7.5% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) with a median survival time of 17.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 5-year adjusted survival rate according to stage was 43.4% for patients with Stage I lesions, 23.6% for Stage II lesions, and 12.8% for Stage III lesions (p = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis of risk factors involved in survival disclosed that neither age, sex, site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, duration of symptoms, or cell type influenced survival, but stage of the disease had a profound effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that long-term survival of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus or cardia will probably not improve until early diagnosis is possible and that esophagogastrectomy by conventional techniques should be the treatment of choice until other forms of therapy prove superior to it both in terms of palliation and long-term survival </plain></SENT>
