<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had an excellent symptomatic response to antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiologic studies, esophageal manometry, and intraesophageal pH studies were performed before surgery and at intervals thereafter, and documented the success of antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 2 yr of surgery, there was endoscopic and histologic evidence of squamous regression of columnar mucosa, and this process of regression to squamous epithelium continued over a further 3 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that partial squamous regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may occur in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies dealing with regression are reviewed and proposals are made for a standardized approach to its documentation </plain></SENT>
