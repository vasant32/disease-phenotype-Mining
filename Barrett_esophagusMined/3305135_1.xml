<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 13 of 19 patients (68.4%) with detectable pepsinogen A, different isozymogen patterns were found between the Barrett's epithelium and the gastric corpus mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Discrepancies consisted mainly of a stronger pepsinogen 5 band in the Barrett's epithelium, with a higher incidence in biopsy specimens with features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> than with no or indefinite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; the difference was, however, not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Zymograms of 69 biopsy specimens from Barrett's epithelium were correlated with the histologic type: pepsinogen A and C were most frequently found in the fundic type, least often in the specialized intestinal type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In control gastric corpus biopsy specimens, pepsinogen A and C as well as slow-moving protease were always detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observed variability of gastric protease patterns, in particular of pepsinogen A isozymograms, may be due to differences in expression within the pepsinogen A cluster, suggesting a deregulation of gene expression or partial deletion of the pepsinogen A gene cluster </plain></SENT>
