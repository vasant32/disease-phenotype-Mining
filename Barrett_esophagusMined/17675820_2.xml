<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A series of rats underwent a duodenoesophageal reflux procedure and were divided into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One group was given commercial chow (control group), and the other group was given experimental chow containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi>, a selective COX-2 inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed sequentially after surgery and esophageal examinations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the control group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) were observed, and the frequency of these conditions increased with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>COX-2 expression, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) level and proliferative activity were up-regulated, predominantly in the inflamed esophageal epithelia, from the 10(th) week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> group, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was mild and the frequency of BE was significantly lower than the control group, while EAC was not observed throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) level and proliferative activity were lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>COX-2 may play an important role in esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> through the activation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">Nimesulide</z:chebi> is effective in preventing BE and EAC by suppressing COX-2 activity </plain></SENT>
