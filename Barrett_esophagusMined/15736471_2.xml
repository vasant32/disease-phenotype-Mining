<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had years previously been subjected to a total proctocolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following surgery, endoscopical biopsies were obtained from the duodenum (10 biopsies) in four instances and from the ileal pouch (6 biopsies) in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsies were taken between 1988 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) sections from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those 16 biopsies were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one biopsy from the ileal pouch, a tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> carrying 92% dysplastic Paneth cells was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Paneth cells were more easily singled out when H&amp;E sections were observed in a fluorescent microscope than when using conventional transmitted light, or lysozyme immunostain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite a wide distribution of Paneth cells in mucosas with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>), in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> small intestine and in the large intestine with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> only a few Paneth cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> have been reported in the GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cause of the apparent natural resistance of these specialized cells provided with anti-microbial and growth factors to undergo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> deserve further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A review of the literature indicates that this is the first reported case of Paneth cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> of the small intestine </plain></SENT>
