<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: To define the factors, which significantly increase the risk for development <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 36 patients hospitalized in the years 2005-2007 in the Department of Digestive Tract Diseases, Medical University in Lódź, with diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (based on gastroscopy with biopsy and histopathologic findings) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the analysis, two control groups of healthy subjects were chosen: I--35 patients (mean age 54.3 years) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastroscopy, II--40 patients (mean age 54.2 years) who had not undergone gastroscopy Risk factors were evaluated according to the self-elaborated, filled-in questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following risk factors were taken into consideration: age, sex, BMI, stimulants (cigarettes, alcohol and coffee), diet, eating habits (preferred food, fruit and vegetables consumption, regularity and quantity of meals), physical activity, heartburn sensation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">swallowing disorders</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, other diseases and family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age of patients with diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was 55.9 +/- 11.2 years; in men: 55.7 +/- 12.2 and in women: 56.3 +/- 9.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the analyzed group there were 25 men (69.4%) and 11 women (30.6%), the man/woman ratio was 2.3:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the group with diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> the heartburn sensation was observed in 30 (83.3%) patients, overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI &gt;25 kg/m2) in 22 (61.1%) patients, 16 (44.4%) patients smoked cigarettes, 11 (30.6%) had swallowing problems, 12 (33.3%) suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors and symptoms, mentioned above have been significantly more often observed, as compared to I and/or II control group (p &lt; or = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance for other analyzed factors was not reached (significance value p &lt; or = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is associated with: male sex, overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2), cigarette smoking, heartburn sensation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">swallowing disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
