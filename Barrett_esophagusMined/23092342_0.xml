<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence that miR-375 regulates gene expression associated with resistance to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, microRNA expression assays have the potential to provide clinically relevant information about prognosis and potential response to chemotherapy in patients with esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results are inconsistent, however, for microRNAs across different studies for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) vs. its precursor lesion <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These inconsistencies may partly result from pathological and/or molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and EAC, but may also result from differences in study designs or different choices of comparator tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite these inconsistencies, however, several <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>/protein targets have been identified, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> related biology of some of these targets is well understood, and there are clinico-pathological associations for some of these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs also have potential for use in therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of new delivery methods, such as minicells and autologous microvesicles, and molecular modifications such as the addition of aromatic <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16227">pyridine</z:chebi> analogs, have facilitated the exploration of the effects of therapeutic microRNAs in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These approaches are producing encouraging results, with one technology in a phase I/IIa clinical trial </plain></SENT>
