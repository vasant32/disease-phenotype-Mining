<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To investigate the factors leading to histologic regression of metaplastic and dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: The study sample consisted of 91 consecutive patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pre- and posttreatment endoscopic biopsies from 77 Barrett's patients treated surgically and 14 treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An expert pathologist confirmed the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Posttreatment histology was classified as having regressed if two consecutive biopsies taken more than 6 months apart plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequent biopsies showed loss of IM or loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical factors associated with regression were studied by multivariate analysis, as was the time course of its occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histopathologic regression occurred in 28 of 77 patients (36.4%) after antireflux surgery and in 1 of 14 patients (7.1%) treated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> alone (p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After surgery, regression from low-grade dysplastic to nondysplastic BE occurred in 17 of 25 patients (68%) and from IM to no IM in 11 of 52 (21.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both types of regression were significantly more common in short (&lt; 3 cm) than long (&gt; 3 cm) segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; 19 of 33 (58%) and 9 of 44 (20%) patients, respectively (p = 0.0016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients progressed, five from IM alone to low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and three from low- to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> those who progressed had long segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, presence of short segment Barrett's and type of treatment were significantly associated with regression; age, gender, surgical procedure, and preoperative lower esophageal sphincter and pH characteristics were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median time of biopsy-proved regression was 18.5 months after surgery, with 95% occurring within 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study refutes the widely held assumption that once established, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> does not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>More than one-third of patients with visible segments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> undergo histologic regression after antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Regression is dependent on the length of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> and time of followup after antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
