<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) is often a component of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and is characterized by a distinctive type of epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because IM has the potential to progress to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, an accurate identification of its presence is important clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cytopathologic diagnosis of IM on esophageal brushings by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alone can be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the role of hepatocyte paraffin 1 (Heppar-1) immunostaining as a possible marker of IM in cytologic samples of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven samples each of BE with and without IM diagnosed on esophageal brushings were retrieved from the cytopathology files of The Johns Hopkins Hospital over an 8-year period (1993-2001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 22 specimens were confirmed histologically on subsequent tissue biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Slides initially were prepared by cytospin and stained with Papanicolaou stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After destaining, the slides were immunostained with hepatocyte paraffin 1 (Heppar-1) antibody at 1:100 dilution employing conventional methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the samples of BE with IM, 9 of 11 samples (82%) were immunoreactive for Heppar-1, compared with 0 of 11 specimens of BE with only cardiac-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The immunoexpression was cytoplasmic and granular and was seen only focally in the glandular fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Heppar-1 was a moderately sensitive (82%) and highly specific (100%) immunomarker for IM in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was easy to use in limited cytologic samples that originally were stained with Papanicolaou stain and is recommended for inclusion in morphologically difficult samples of BE with questionable IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The immunostaining pattern predominantly was focal, necessitating a careful evaluation of positive reactions on cytologic samples </plain></SENT>
