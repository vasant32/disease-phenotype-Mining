<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The presence of low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) within <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has a multitude of ramifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of markers that could risk stratify LGD would be of great clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to prospectively evaluate the prognosis of the immunohistochemical overexpression of p53 protein in BE colocalized to LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive BE patients in whom LGD was found had a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy within 8-12 wk per an ongoing prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At each esophagogastroduodenoscopy, a therapeutic scope was used in conjunction with the Seattle Biopsy Protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were observed until development of multifocal high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (mHGD), presence of an HGD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-associated lesion or mass (DALM) lesion, or frank <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p53 protein overexpression was determined by computerized immunoquantitation using image analysis software on step serial-sectioned specimens of BE segment(s) harboring LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival curves were made on the ability of p53 staining colocalized to areas of LGD to predict progression to mHGD, HGD DALM, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> during prospective follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-eight BE patients with LGD were observed for a mean of 41.2+/-22.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During this period, five of 48 patients progressed to mHGD with a focus in which intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> could not be excluded (one), mHGD/DALM with one or more foci in which intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> could not be excluded (two), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (one), or mHGD (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve had persistent LGD and 31 had regressed to no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>p53 staining was positive and colocalized to areas of LGD in 4/31 of patients that regressed, 3/12 that persisted, and 3/5 that progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier curves differed significantly between p53 positive and negative patients for outcome defined as progression of LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: p53 colocalization with LGD at index LGD diagnosis is a risk factor for progression of LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This can potentially be used to risk stratify BE LGD patients in terms of surveillance intervals or enrollment into secondary prevention studies </plain></SENT>
