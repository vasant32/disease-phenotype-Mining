<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a modification of a rat model of duodenoesophageal reflux that incorporates Nissen fundoplication and uses it to study the role of fundoplication in ameliorating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A previously described rat model of duodenoesophageal reflux was modified to include Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reflux threshold (RT), defined as the gastric pressure required to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> during transgastric instillation of saline, was measured in 12 Sprague-Dawley rats at baseline, after cardiomyotomy with esophagogastroduodenal anastomosis (EGDA), after subsequent Nissen fundoplication, and, finally, after takedown of Nissen fundoplication (NF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiomyotomy with EGDA induced no significant change in RT compared with baseline (mean RT +/- SD: 4.0 +/- 1.9 mmHg and 6.0 +/- 2.5 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.741) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nissen fundoplication led to a 14-fold increase in RT (56.4 +/- 18.2 mmHg) compared with cardiomyotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RT pressure reverted to baseline levels after NF takedown (4.7 +/- 2.9 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antegrade esophageal flow was demonstrated without an increase in distal esophageal pressure after NF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nissen fundoplication creates a one-way antireflux mechanism that eliminates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in this rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This modification of an in vivo model of duodenoesophageal reflux represents a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of NF on cardiomyotomy-induced reflux and distal esophageal exposure to duodenogastric refluxate, and could be useful in the study of the role of NF in preventing progression to BE and ECA </plain></SENT>
