<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of an EGD before the diagnosis of EAC on survival after the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective, controlled cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: The national administrative databases of the Veterans Affairs were accessed, and patients diagnosed with EAC, from 1995 through 2003, who had a prior diagnosis consistent with GER were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electronic medical records were then abstracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases were subjects who had an EGD performed between 1 and 5 years before the diagnosis of EAC; controls were those subjects without a prior EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 155 subjects with EAC and GER were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases with a history of an EGD at least 1 year before a diagnosis of EAC (n = 25) were diagnosed at earlier stages than those without a prior EGD (P = .02) but did not experience a significant improvement in survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.93 [95% CI, 0.58-1.50]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cases who had been enrolled in surveillance programs that adhered to published guidelines trended toward improved survival, but long-term survival reverted toward the rate found without any surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A prior EGD was associated with an improved stage at the diagnosis of EAC but did not alter long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the absence of prospective, randomized, controlled trials, the benefit of screening and surveillance to decrease mortality from EAC cannot be confirmed </plain></SENT>
