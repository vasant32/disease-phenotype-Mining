<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After widespread endoscopic resection, related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> may hamper balloon-based circumferential RFA (c-RFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However c-RFA immediately followed by endoscopic resection in the same session might avoid the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> and reduce laceration and stenosis risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the feasibility of such an approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> ≥ 3 cm and ≥ 1 visible lesion (HGD/early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visible lesions were marked with cautery, and c-RFA (12 J/cm2) was delivered using two applications and a cleaning step, followed by resection of the delineated area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were surface regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at 3 months, need for subsequent c-RFA, complications, and quality of resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 24 patients (20 men, 4 women; mean age 68 years, standard deviation [SD] 12; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> median length C6M8) underwent single-session c-RFA + endoscopic resection, providing a median of 4 (interquartile range [IQR] 2 - 6) resection specimens (early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> 18 patients; HGD 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications included 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, 4 <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp>, and 5 stenoses; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were managed endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specimens allowed assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> depth, differentiation, and lymphatic/vascular invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> surface regression at 3 months was 95 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient required a second c-RFA procedure and 40 % required repeat endoscopic resection for visible lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complete response for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was achieved in 100 % and complete response for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CR-IM) in 95 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: c-RFA followed by endoscopic resection in the same session is feasible, but technically demanding and associated with a substantial rate of complications and repeat endoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This approach should be reserved for selected cases in expert centers, with endoscopic resection and RFA 6 - 8 weeks later remaining the standard combined approach </plain></SENT>
