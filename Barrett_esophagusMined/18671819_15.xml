<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Grading Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at the lower end of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> spectrum (negative, indefinite, and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) suffers from poor interobserver agreement, even among gastrointestinal pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data evaluating interobserver agreement in Barrett's mucosal biopsies with changes at the upper end of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> spectrum (high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, intramucosal, and submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) have not been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The accurate categorization of pretreatment biopsies drives therapeutic decision making, but if the diagnostic distinction between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's biopsies is inconsistent, then the use of these diagnoses to make management decisions is suspect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this end, our aim was to assess interobserver reproducibility among a group of gastrointestinal pathologists in the interpretation of preresection biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> study pathologists agreed upon the histologic criteria distinguishing four diagnostic categories, including high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with marked distortion of glandular architecture, cannot exclude intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; and submucosally invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histologic criteria were used to independently review preresection biopsies from 163 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients with at least high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> who ultimately underwent esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reviewers recorded the specific histologic criteria used to categorize each case and Kappa statistics were calculated to assess interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using kappa statistics, the overall agreement was only fair (kappa= 0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Agreement for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was moderate (kappa= 0.47), while agreement for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with marked architectural distortion, cannot exclude intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were only fair (kappa= 0.21 and 0.30, respectively) and agreement for submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was poor (kappa= 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall poor interobserver reproducibility among gastrointestinal pathologists who see a high volume of Barrett's cases calls into question treatment regimens based on the assumption that high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> can reliably be distinguished in biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
