<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several classifications of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> have been proposed in Barrett oesophagus using narrow-band imaging (NBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a simplified classification in which only the regularity of mucosal and vascular patterns were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the inter and intraobserver agreement and the correlation with histology of a simplified NBI classification of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in Barrett oesophagus combining the experience of two referral centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred NBI images [57 high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN)/early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (EC)] were evaluated twice by four NBI-experienced and four nonexperienced endoscopists in the field of NBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopists assessed each image for: quality, suspicion for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and regularity of mucosal and vascular patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Observer agreement was assessed using kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall interobserver agreement for the items evaluated was 'moderate' and varied between 0.42 and 0.44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall intraobserver agreement was 'moderate' to 'substantial' (kappa 0.60-0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in agreement between expert and nonexpert endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endoscopist correctly identified 71% of the images containing HGIN/EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the areas without HGIN/EC, 68% were correctly identified as not suspicious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Again, there were no significant differences between experts and nonexperts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our proposed, simplified classification for Barrett mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> has a moderate interobserver and a moderate to substantial intraobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The lack of differences in agreements between expert and nonexpert endoscopists suggests a short learning curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The disappointing rate for correctly indentifying HGIN/EC, questions, however, whether detailed inspection of Barrett oesophagus with NBI can replace histological sampling </plain></SENT>
