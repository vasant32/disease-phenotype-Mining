<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms of the progression from BE to EA are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> reflux may also play an important role in the progression from BE to EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the role of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and a novel <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase NOX5-S in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>-induced increase in cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9410">taurodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (TDCA) significantly increased NOX5-S expression, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>) production, and cell proliferation in EA cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TDCA-induced increase in cell proliferation was significantly reduced by U73122, an inhibitor of PI-PLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PI-PLCbeta1, PI-PLCbeta3, PI-PLCbeta4, PI-PLCgamma1, and PI-PLCgamma2, but not PI-PLCbeta2 and PI-PLCdelta1, were detectable in FLO cells by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of PI-PLCgamma2 or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase with small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (siRNA) significantly decreased TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production, and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, knockdown of PI-PLCbeta1, PI-PLCbeta3, PI-PLCbeta4, PI-PLCgamma1, or ERK1 MAP kinase had no significant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TDCA significantly increased ERK2 phosphorylation, an increase that was reduced by U73122 or PI-PLCgamma2 siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TDCA-induced increase in NOX5-S expression and cell proliferation may depend on sequential activation of PI-PLCgamma2 and ERK2 MAP kinase in EA cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is possible that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> reflux present in patients with BE may increase reactive oxygen species production and cell proliferation via activation of PI-PLCgamma2, ERK2 MAP kinase, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase NOX5-S, thereby contributing to the development of EA </plain></SENT>
