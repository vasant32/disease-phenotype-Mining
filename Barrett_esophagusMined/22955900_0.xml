<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: During the past decades, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) has been developed to treat early intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> and dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary drawback of this method is severe postsurgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this preclinical study was to assess strategies for prevention of this major complication by injecting autologous keratinocytes in the EMR mucosal defect in the sheep model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Circumferential, 6-cm-long EMRs were performed in the esophagus of nine sheep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autologous keratinocytes were harvested 2 weeks before EMR and cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circumferential resection consisted of two opposite hemicircumferential mucosectomies allowing a widespread resection of 24 cm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediately after EMR, autologous keratinocytes were endoscopically injected in the mucosal defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Circumferential EMRs were successfully performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no intra- or postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the animals developed strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were sacrificed at 6 months as planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histological examinations showed fibrotic changes in 10 % (range 0-25 %) of the circumferential muscularis propria interna layer and 7.2 % (range 0-25 %) in the muscularis propria externa layer at the midportion of the EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No circumferential transmural <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of stricture formation after extensive (6-cm long) circumferential EMR of the sheep esophagus can be achieved by injecting autologous keratinocytes into the wound of the resected mucosal segment </plain></SENT>
