<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A nonendoscopic device that allows for screening of these patients would offer significant cost savings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This pilot study evaluates the utility of cytologically diagnosing BE using a prototype flexible mesh catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with known BE undergoing indicated surveillance endoscopy were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytology specimens were obtained using a prototype flexible catheter and were evaluated for the presence of glandular cells, goblet cells, squamous cells, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with BE were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the patients experienced complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specimens from eight patients (73%) were adequate for evaluation and seven of these patients (87.5%) had goblet cells diagnostic for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, flexible mesh catheters potentially offer a sensitive, inexpensive, and minimally invasive approach to evaluating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and BE </plain></SENT>
