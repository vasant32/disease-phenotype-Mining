<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication and the Rossetti modification represent two different surgical approaches to resolving <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concerns have arisen that the Rossetti modification results in increased postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared a group of patients who underwent a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with a group who had undergone the Rossetti modification to determine if there was a significant difference in postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we wanted to confirm that the Nissen procedure performed laparoscopically could resolve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> as successfully as the Rossetti modification, with no difference in operative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively collected data on 101 patients who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication and compared outcomes with those of 138 patients who had undergone the laparoscopic Rossetti modification in a previous series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients experienced resolution of reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of intraoperative or postoperative complications, conversions to open procedure, or length of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, there was a significant difference in operating time between the Rossetti and the Nissen groups (70.6 min vs 45.6 min, p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> requiring dilation was significantly higher in the Rossetti group (21.7% vs 8.9%, p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significantly higher percentage of patients in the Rossetti group who had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> preoperatively (95.7% vs 86.1%, p = 0.009), although the proportion of patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was higher in the Nissen group (9.4% vs 24.8%, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both approaches resolved reflux symptoms without significant differences in complications, conversions, or length of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preoperative differences between groups, as well as the method of sequentially comparing the two different procedures, prevent us from attributing greater postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in the Rossetti group solely to the choice of surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prospective randomized studies are needed to control for variables, such as surgical team experience and patient differences </plain></SENT>
