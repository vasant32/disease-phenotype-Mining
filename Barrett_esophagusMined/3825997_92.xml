<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors assessed the relationship between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in a study of both endoscopic biopsy specimens and esophagectomy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They reviewed the pathologic findings and clinical follow-up of 14 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's mucosa in endoscopic biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They also studied systematically the histopathologic features of the Barrett's mucosa in 43 esophagectomy specimens resected for Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the biopsy specimens, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> occurred in distinctive-type Barrett's mucosa of 13 patients (93%) but in cardiac-type mucosa of only 3 (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; five underwent esophagectomy and three of these were found to have superficially invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other patient with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> as well as eight patients with intermediate- or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> are not known to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> on available follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the study of resection specimens, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was strongly associated with adjoining invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, because 84% of areas with invasion had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 92% of areas with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors' findings suggest that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence most commonly occurs in Barrett's mucosa of the distinctive type; high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's mucosa is a marker indicating high probability of invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; the presence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in biopsy specimens of Barrett's mucosa is an indication for esophagectomy in suitable surgical candidates </plain></SENT>
