<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, however, there is little compelling evidence to support the reversal of Barrett's through pharmacological or surgical therapy, and endoscopic reversal of Barrett's has not yet been validated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data suggest that a combination of acid suppression with COX-2 inhibition might be the most effective chemopreventive strategy </plain></SENT>
