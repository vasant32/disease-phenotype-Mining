<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biopsies from two oesophagoscopies revealed similar changes, suggesting that the predominance of Mott cells is not a fortuitous event but a more long-lasting microscopic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">Periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>) stain ruled out Candida albicans and immunostains, plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mott cells were not present in biopsies from the gastric mucosa or the urinary bladder, suggesting that this phenomenon was not widespread but localized to the Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The retention of immunoglobulins (Russell bodies) suggests that the mechanism of protein transport in those plasma cells is incompetent, and that the proteins are neither degraded nor secreted, but remain stored in dilated cisternae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased awareness of the existence of this subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagitis</z:e> may result in similar cases being reported in the future </plain></SENT>
