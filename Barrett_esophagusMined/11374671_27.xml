<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: It has been suggested that Barrett's epithelium and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the gastric cardia have different cyotokeratin (CK) staining patterns and that Barrett's epithelium can be distinguished by CK staining pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the utility of CK staining for distinguishing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> from gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Topographically mapped gastric biopsy specimens were obtained from patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and esophageal biopsies were obtained from patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (&gt;3 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial sections were stained with Genta or El-Zimaity triple stain, and biopsies with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were stained with antibodies against CK 4, 13, 7, and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sections from 33 biopsies with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 23 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastric cardia, 27 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastric body, and 33 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the antrum were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CK 4 and CK 13 stained squamous epithelium only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proposed "diagnostic" CK Barrett's 7/20 pattern was found in only 39% of long-segment Barrett's compared to 35%, 4%, and 24% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> from the gastric cardia, body, and antrum, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The criteria proposed had a sensitivity of 45% and a specificity of 65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support keratin phenotyping as a tool for differentiating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> originating in the cardia from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of Barrett's </plain></SENT>
