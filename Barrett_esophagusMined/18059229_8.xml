<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Depth of invasion is one of the most important prognostic indicators in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike other regions of the gastrointestinal tract, the esophagus in Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> frequently develops duplication of the muscularis mucosae (MM), but this feature is underrecognized, and its effect on appropriate staging of superficially invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We first randomly selected 50 esophageal resections for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or T1 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of MM duplication for BE and its histologic characteristics, including percentage of the Barrett segment involved by MM duplication, origin of the duplicated muscle layer, and appearance of the tissue between duplicated MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty esophageal resections for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, to study the clinical significance of MM duplication, we evaluated 30 resections for BE that had superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> confined to regions of duplicated MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each case was classified as: depth of invasion (inner MM, space between duplicated MM, or outer MM), angiolymphatic invasion, and rate of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed MM duplication in 46 of 50 (92%) BE resections, involving 5% to &gt;90% of the Barrett segment, in contrast to none in 20 (0%) resected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, P&lt;0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 5 (10%) cases, the MM was focally triplicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The outer MM was continuous with the single MM beneath squamous epithelium, suggesting that outer MM represents the "original" muscle layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The space between duplicated MM predominantly consisted of loose fibrovascular tissue similar to submucosa; in 15 (30%) cases, there were also areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> or thin muscle strands joining the 2 MM layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 30 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> invading duplicated MM, 10 (33%) invaded only inner MM, 12 (40%) invaded the space between MM, and 8 (27%) invaded the outer MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Angiolymphatic invasion was present in 5 (17%) cases, and nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in 3 (10%, 1 case each of invasion into inner MM, between MM, and outer MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data show that MM duplication is a characteristic finding in BE, but it can pose difficulty in proper staging of superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 17% rate of angiolymphatic invasion and 10% rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> in our patients with invasion into duplicated MM suggest that these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> can behave aggressively despite their technically intramucosal location </plain></SENT>
