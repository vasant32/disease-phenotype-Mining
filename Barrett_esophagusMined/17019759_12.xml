<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are recommended to undergo regular surveillance with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, an invasive procedure that may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, pain, and discomfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed to what extent patients perceived this procedure as burdensome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 192 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were asked to fill out questionnaires at 1 week and immediately before endoscopy, and at 1 week and 1 month afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four variables were assessed: (i) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112117" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pain and discomfort</z:e> experienced during endoscopy; (ii) symptoms; (iii) psychological burden, i. e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and distress levels (Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale, Impact of Event Scale); and (iv) perceived risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At least one questionnaire was returned by 180 patients (94 %), 151 completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four (79 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, only 14 % experienced the endoscopy as painful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 59 % reported it to be burdensome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apart from an increase in throat ache (47 % after endoscopy versus 12 % before), the procedure did not cause physical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients' <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and distress levels were significantly increased in the week before endoscopy compared with the week after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients perceiving their risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> as high reported higher levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> and that the procedure was a greater burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is burdensome for many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and causes moderate distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Perception of a high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> may increase distress and the burden experienced from the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The benefits of endoscopic surveillance for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> should be weighed against its drawbacks, including the short-term burden for patients </plain></SENT>
