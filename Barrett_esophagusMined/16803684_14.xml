<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the prevalence of and risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with the intestinal predominant mucin phenotype in patients undergoing endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1699 consecutive patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A targeted biopsy was performed when endoscopically observed columnar-appearing esophagus was stained with crystal violet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sample, histologically evidenced as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, was immunohistochemically evaluated and categorized as of either gastric or intestinal predominant mucin phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were requested to complete the structured questionnaire indicating their symptoms and food consumption patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of and risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with and without the intestinal predominant mucin phenotype were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 1668 patients, 629 (37.7%) were found to have endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 333 out of 1668 patients (19.9%), histological studies were diagnostic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred and six of these 333 patients (31.8%) had the intestinal predominant mucin phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age, male gender and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> were confirmed by multivariate analysis as the independent predictors for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with the intestinal predominant mucin phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with the intestinal predominant mucin phenotype was immunohistochemically found in 6.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Older age, male gender and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> were the risk factors for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with the intestinal predominant mucin phenotype </plain></SENT>
