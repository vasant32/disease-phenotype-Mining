<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report herein a case of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising from short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) in a 36-year-old man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was found at the esophagogastric junction, and a histological evaluation of the biopsy specimen led to a diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was found to be confined to the mucosa surrounding the SSBE, and endoscopic submucosal dissection was done without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the resected specimen showed that the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had also invaded the muscularis mucosae and provided evidence of lymphovascular invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional surgical resection and regional lymph node dissection were therefore carried out; however, no lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising from Barrett's mucosa is rare in young patients, especially in Japan, and this case is therefore particularly noteworthy </plain></SENT>
