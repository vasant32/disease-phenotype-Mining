<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-term data on treatment success and safety are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of spray cryotherapy in patients with BE-HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Single-center, retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary-care referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 32 patients with BE-HGD of any length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Patients were treated with liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy every 8 weeks until complete eradication of HGD (CE-HGD) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CE-IM) was found by endoscopic biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surveillance endoscopy with biopsies was performed for at least 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: CE-HGD, CE-IM, durability of response, disease progression, and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CE-HGD was 100% (32/32), and CE-IM was 84% (27/32) at 2-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up (range 24-57 months), CE-HGD was 31/32 (97%), and CE-IM was 26/32 (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recurrent HGD was found in 6 (18%), with CE-HGD in 5 after repeat treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, downgraded to HGD after repeat cryotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BE segment length ≥3 cm was associated with a higher recurrence of IM (P = .004; odds ratio 22.6) but not HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse events occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Stricture was seen in 3 patients (9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> successfully dilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study design, small sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with BE-HGD, liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy has an acceptable safety profile and success rate for eliminating HGD and IM and is associated with a low rate of recurrence or progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
