<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Basal and stimulated gastric secretions were studied for 1 hr in the unstimulated state and 1 hr after pentagastrin 6 microg/kg subcutaneous injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because Barrett's patients are predominantly male, the 30 patients were matched with patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, but not Barrett's, for sex (26 men, 4 women) and age as well as for background <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo> in 10, no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> disease in 17 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043515" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZES">Zollinger-Ellison</z:e> hypersecretors in 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with Barrett's weighed more than controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acid and pepsin output in the basal and stimulated state were no different in Barrett's and their appropriately matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overnight fasting residue--volume, pH, acid and pepsin concentrations, and bile content--were also alike </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcer</z:mp> or stricture was not different between those with and without Barrett's and in neither was the grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> related to acid or pepsin output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients do not have gastric secretions different from appropriately matched controls with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When present, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> due to reflux in Barrett's epithelium should be treated on its merits by appropriate reduction of acid exposure </plain></SENT>
