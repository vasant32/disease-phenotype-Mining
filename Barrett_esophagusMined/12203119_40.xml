<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous work indicates that BM and BA are associated with reduced E-cadherin expression and increased cytoplasmic/nuclear pools of its associated protein beta-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>beta-catenin participates in Wnt signalling and activates oncogene transcription by complexing with T-cells factors (TCF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One such oncogene is c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that TNF-alpha can down-regulate E-cadherin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we assess TNF-alpha expression in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and examine if TNF-alpha can promote beta-catenin mediated transcription of oncogenes in a gastrointestinal model system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Employing immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis of oesophageal tissue, epithelial expression of TNF-alpha increases with progression along the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>beta-catenin mediated transcription was then assessed in TNF-alpha stimulated cell lines using the TOPFLASH reporter system whilst c-myc expression was assessed by real time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a columnar intestinal cell model, TNF-alpha induces c-myc expression which is induced via beta-catenin mediated transcription (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This beta-catenin mediated transcription is independent of NF-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, TNF-alpha is up-regulated in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and beta-catenin mediated transcription of c-myc is a novel pathway whereby elevated levels of TNF-alpha may lead to oncogene transcription and altered biology in gastrointestinal epithelia and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
