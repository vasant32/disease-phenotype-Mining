<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (GORD), is a condition that is premalignant for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, once an uncommon entity, has been growing rapidly in incidence over the last two decades in several parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a change in the esophageal epithelium of any length that can be recognized at endoscopy and is confirmed to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> by biopsy (American College of Gastroenterology guidelines) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of its premalignant nature, it is recommended that patients with BE undergo regular endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recommendation for endoscopic surveillance is based on unproved and controversial assumptions including: 1) the assumption that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> adversely influences survival; 2) the assumption that endoscopic surveillance can reliably detect early, curable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the low incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence rates in prospective studies on BE range between 0.5% and 1.9%) is used to support an approach of not surveying patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite these not convincing data, endoscopic surveillance is considered ''reasonable'' and ''desirable'' by the gastroenterological associations and consensus meetings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is performed primarily to seek <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, to prevent the progression to invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>; however, one of the limitations of using <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is a lack of understanding of its natural history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of endoscopic surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is likely to remain unclear for a long time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The American College of Gastroenterology has recommended the following practice guidelines: a) for patients with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, surveillance endoscopy is recommended at an interval of every 2 to 3 years; b) for patients with low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, surveillance endoscopy every 6 months for the first year is recommended, followed by yearly endoscopy if the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> has not progressed in severity; c) for patients with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, two alternatives are proposed after the diagnosis has been confirmed by an expert gastrointestinal pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One alternative is intensive endoscopic surveillance until intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is detected at an interval of every 3-6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The other alternative is esophageal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the situation of indeterminate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, whereas the pathologist can not come to definite diagnosis, control biopsies are proposed after 2 months of adequate acid suppression by means of proton pump inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the technique of random, four quadrant biopsies taken every 2 cm in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> for standard histologic evaluation is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Any grossly abnormal areas may be biopsied too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One can expect however that during the next future these protocol will change considering new data on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection (biochemical markers, flow cytometry), new techniques to identify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (chromoendoscopy, endosonography, coherence optical tomography, fluorescence techniques) and development of better ablative techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At present a marker other than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> identifying a high risk group for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> on which to focus endoscopic surveillance has not yet been established </plain></SENT>
