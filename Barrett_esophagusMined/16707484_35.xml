<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms whereby <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> may accelerate the progression from BE to EA are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that NOX1 and NOX5-S were the major isoforms of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase in SEG1-EA cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of NOX5-S <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly higher in these cells than in esophageal squamous epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NOX5 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was also significantly higher in Barrett tissues with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> than without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulsed acid treatment significantly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production in both SEG1-EA cells and BE mucosa, which was blocked by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50423">NADPH oxidase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In SEG1 cells, acid treatment increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of NOX5-S, but not NOX1, and knockdown of NOX5 by NOX5 small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> abolished acid-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, acid treatment increased intracellular Ca(2+) and phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Acid-induced NOX5-S expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production were significantly inhibited by removal of extracellular Ca(2+) and by knockdown of CREB using CREB small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two novel CREB-binding elements TGACGAGA and TGACGCTG were identified in the NOX5-S gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of CREB significantly increased NOX5-S promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of NOX5 significantly decreased [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation, which was restored by 10(-13) M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of NOX5 also significantly decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein phosphorylation and increased cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and caspase-9 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in SEG1 EA cells NOX5-S is overexpressed and mediates acid-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Acid-induced NOX5-S expression depends on an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) and activation of CREB </plain></SENT>
