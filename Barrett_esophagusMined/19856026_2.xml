<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A correlation of -0.70 was previously identified between PCR and pharyngeal clearing pressures (PP) on separate fluoroscopic and manometric studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As PP increases, PCR decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to evaluate the correlation between PCR and PP in 25 patients undergoing simultaneous fluoroscopy and pharyngeal manometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of the manometric catheter on PCR was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the PCR and averaged pharyngeal clearing pressures was -0.72 (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a PCR&gt;0.25 had a P &lt;60 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCR did not differ significantly as a consequence of the manometric catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results suggest the utility of an objective fluoroscopic measure in assessing pharyngeal strength when manometry may not be available or possible </plain></SENT>
