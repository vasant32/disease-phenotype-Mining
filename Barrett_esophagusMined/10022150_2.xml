<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to review the need for regular endoscopic biopsy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective case-notes review of 38 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> treated between January 1982 and August 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis was 6.3 years (range, 1 to 15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients were treated medically, and 36 underwent antireflux surgery (32 Nissen fundoplication, four Thal procedures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, for a mean of 43 months (range, 0 to 13 years), 25 underwent repeated endoscopy and biopsies, two underwent further surgery and biopsies, and four underwent endoscopy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven have had follow-up at their referring hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 27 patients who underwent rebiopsy, there was continued evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was reversion to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue in 10 patients, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was present in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of any dysplastic or malignant change in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases that reverted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus or mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> had previously undergone a Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dysplastic degeneration and malignant change did not occur in any of the authors' patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> reverted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The authors therefore question whether regular endoscopic surveillance is necessary in children under 16 years of age </plain></SENT>
