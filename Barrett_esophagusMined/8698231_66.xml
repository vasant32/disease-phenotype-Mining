<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Typically, four-quadrant pinch biopsy specimens are taken at 2-cm intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine whether laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy could be used to detect high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred ten-naonometer laser light was used to induce autofluorescence of Barrett's mucosa in 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spectra were analyzed using the differential normalized fluorescence (DNF) index technique to differentiate high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from either low-grade or nondysplastic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each spectrum was classified as either premalignant or benign using two different DNF indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of the fluorescence spectra from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients collectively using the DNF intensity at 480 nm (DNF480) index showed that 96% of nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> samples were classified as benign, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> samples as benign, 90% of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> samples as premalignant, and 28% of low-grade with focal high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> samples as premalignant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the two DNF indices concurrently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with any high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were classified correctly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy has great potential to detect high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> when using the DNF technique </plain></SENT>
