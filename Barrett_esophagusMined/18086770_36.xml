<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Leukocyte telomere length has gained attention as a marker of oxidative damage and age-related diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that leukocyte telomere length might be able to predict future risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and examined this in a cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, who are at increased risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and thus were enrolled in a long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients and METHODS: In this prospective study, telomere length was measured by quantitative PCR in baseline blood samples in a cohort of 300 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> followed for a mean of 5.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte telomere length hazard ratios (HR) for risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were calculated using multivariate Cox models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Shorter telomeres were associated with increased esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> risk (age-adjusted HR between top and bottom quartiles of telomere length, 3.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-8.78; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association was still significant when individually or simultaneously adjusted for age, gender, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>) use, cigarette smoking, and waist-to-hip ratio (HR, 4.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.60-10.94; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between telomere length and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk was particularly strong among <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> nonusers, ever smokers, and patients with low waist-to-hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Leukocyte telomere length predicts risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> independently of smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results show the ability of leukocyte telomere length to predict the risk of future <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and suggest that it might also have predictive value in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> arising in a setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
