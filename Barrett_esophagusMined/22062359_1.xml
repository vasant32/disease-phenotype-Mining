<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of modifiable lifestyle factors that affect the risk of progression from BE to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> might prevent its development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated associations among body size, smoking, and alcohol use with progression of BE to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from patients with BE identified from the population-based Northern Ireland BE register, diagnosed between 1993 and 2005 with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (n = 3167) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on clinical, demographic, and lifestyle factors related to diagnosis of BE were collected from hospital case notes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used the Northern Ireland <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry to identify which of these patients later developed esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the gastric cardia, or esophageal high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to associate lifestyle factors with risk of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By December 31, 2008, 117 of the patients with BE developed esophageal high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus or gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current tobacco smoking was significantly associated with an increased risk of progression (hazard ratio = 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-3.17) compared with never smoking, and across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strata of smoking intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alcohol consumption was not related to risk of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Measures of body size were infrequently reported in endoscopy reports, and body size was not associated with risk of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Smoking tobacco increases the risk of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> 2-fold among patients with BE, compared with patients with BE that have never smoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Smoking cessation strategies should be considered for patients with BE </plain></SENT>
