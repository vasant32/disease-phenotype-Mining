<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is over-expressed in BE and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, and supposedly contributes to esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate what effect a COX-2 inhibitor has on esophageal adenocarcinogenesis in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A series of 90 rats underwent a duodenoesophageal reflux procedure and were divided into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One group was given commercial chow (control group), and the other was given experimental chow containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed sequentially, at the 10th, 20th, 30th and, finally, 40th week after surgery, and their esophagi were examined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their incidences sequentially increased and at the 40th week reached 100, 89 and 47%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> group, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was mild and the incidence of CLE was significantly lower at each week (P &lt; 0.001), compared with the control group, and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was not observed throughout the experiment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>COX-2 expression was observed predominantly in the stroma of inflamed esophageal epithelia, and up-regulated at the 10th and 20th week (P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> level and proliferative activity were also up-regulated in both groups, but they were lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
