<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective investigation of endoscopic mucosal resection was conducted in 64 patients (mean age, 65 +/- 10 years) who had early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (61 patients) or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (3 patients) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients met the criteria for low risk: macroscopic types I, IIa, IIb, and IIc; lesion diameter up to 20 mm; mucosal lesion; and histological grades G1 and G2 and/or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 29 patients were included in group B (high risk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 120 resections were performed, with no technical problems encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean number of treatment sessions per patient was 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 +/- 0.6 in group A and 2.8 +/- 2.0 in group B (P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one major complication occurred, a case of spurting <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, which was managed endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete local remission was achieved significantly earlier (P = 0.008) in group A than in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In May 1999, complete remission had been achieved in 97% of the patients in group A and in 59% of those in group B; however, 1 patient in group A and 9 in group B are still undergoing treatment or awaiting the first check-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 12 +/- 8 months, recurrent or metachronous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were found in 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic mucosal resection of early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is associated with promisingly low morbidity and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The procedure may offer a new minimally invasive therapeutic alternative to esophagectomy, especially in low-risk situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Comparisons with surgical results will need to be done when the long-term results of this procedure become available </plain></SENT>
