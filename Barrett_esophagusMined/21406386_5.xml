<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol intake is a strong and well established risk factor for oesophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (OSCC), but the association with oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) or adjacent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> of the oesophagogastric junction (OGJA), remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the association of alcohol intake with OSCC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, and OGJA was determined in nine case-control studies and two cohort studies of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> and Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> Consortium (BEACON) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information was collected on alcohol intake, age, sex, education, body mass index, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e>, and tobacco smoking from each study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Along with 10,854 controls, 1821 OA, and 1837 OGJA, seven studies also collected OSCC cases (n=1016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study specific ORs and 95% CIs were calculated from multivariate adjusted logistic regression models for alcohol intake in categories compared to non-drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Summary risk estimates were obtained by random effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results No increase was observed in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> or OGJA for increasing levels of any of the alcohol intake measures examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ORs for the highest frequency category (≥ 7 drinks per day) were 0.97 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.36) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> and 0.77 (95% CI = 0.54 to 1.10) for OGJA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Suggestive findings linked moderate intake (eg, 0.5 to &lt;1 drink per day) to decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.99) and OGJA (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, alcohol intake was strongly associated with increased risk of OSCC (OR for ≥ 7 drinks per day 9.62, 95% CI 4.26 to 21.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to OSCC, higher alcohol consumption was not associated with increased risk of either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> or OGJA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The apparent inverse association observed with moderate alcohol intake should be evaluated in future prospective studies </plain></SENT>
