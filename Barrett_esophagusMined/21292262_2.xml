<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is safe and effective for eradicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and BE-associated early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most RFA studies have limited the baseline length of BE (&lt;10 cm), and therefore little is known about RFA for longer BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of RFA with or without prior endoscopic resection (ER) for BE ≥ 10 cm containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Two tertiary-care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved consecutive patients with BE ≥ 10 cm with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Focal ER for visible abnormalities, followed by a maximum of 2 circumferential and 3 focal RFA procedures every 2 to 3 months until complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Complete remission, defined as endoscopic resolution of BE and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CR-IM) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (CR-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>) in biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 26 patients included, 18 underwent ER for visible abnormalities before RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ER specimens showed early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in 11, high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) in 6, and low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (LGIN) in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The worst residual histology, before RFA and after any ER, was HGIN in 16 patients and LGIN in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CR-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and CR-IM were achieved in 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63%-95%) and 79% (95% CI, 58%-93%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had fatal or severe complications and 15% (95% CI, 4%-35%) had moderate complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During a mean (± standard deviation) follow-up of 29 (± 9.1) months, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Tertiary-care center, short follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ER for visible abnormalities, followed by RFA of residual BE is a safe and effective treatment for BE ≥ 10 cm containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, with a low chance of recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or BE during follow-up </plain></SENT>
