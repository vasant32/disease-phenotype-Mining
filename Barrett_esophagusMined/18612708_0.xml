<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by H. pylori after partial gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y anastomosis for benign disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 79 patients with long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were submitted to vagotomy, anti-reflux surgery, two thirds distal gastrectomy, and Roux-en-Y anastomosis 70 cm long </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> preoperative biopsy samples were taken from the antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After surgery, four endoscopic studies were performed in different periods of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 98 months after operation (60-240) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three groups of patients were identified: (a) group 1, 43 patients (54%) who had no preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by H. pylori and remained so late after surgery; (b) group 2, 21 patients (27%) who had no preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by H. pylori but presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the gastric remnant that increased parallel to the length of follow-up; (c) group 3, 15 patients (19%) who presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by H. pylori before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From them, 11 showed reinfection of the gastric remnant, while four patients had no reinfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After partial gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y anastomosis for benign disease, there are three different patterns of behavior regarding reinfection or not by H. pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 41% of patients presented H. pylori reinfection at the gastric remnant after Roux-en-Y anastomosis, which increased parallel to the length of follow-up </plain></SENT>
