<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the pre-malignant condition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> by measuring the DNA adducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA adducts were measured in the proximal and distal esophagus of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 9), patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the distal esophagus/esophagogastric junction (n = 28), and in control group of patients (n = 8) using the 32-P-postlabeling method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average levels of DNA adducts are expressed as mean adducts/10(9) <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> + standard error of the mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average DNA adduct levels in the distal esophagus were significantly higher in both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (24.5 +/- 7.9) and the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (12.0 + 3.0) than in the control patients (0.1 +/- 0.08), P &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the proximal esophagus, the DNA adduct levels were approximately equal in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (7.0 +/- 1.0) and in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> group (6.4 +/- 0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the levels in the proximal esophagus in both groups were significantly higher than in the control group (2.1 +/- 0.67), P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and patients with esophageal/esophagogastric junction <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had significantly more DNA adducts than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results support the current concept of the carcinogenic potential of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, and the pre-malignant condition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
