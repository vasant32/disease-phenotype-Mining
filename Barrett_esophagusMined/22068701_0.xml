<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Complete Barrett's excision (CBE) of short-segment Barrett's high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and early esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> by stepwise endoscopic resection is a precise staging tool, detects covert synchronous disease, and may produce a sustained treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>Esophageal stricture</z:hpo> is the most commonly reported complication of CBE although risk factors have not yet been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were recorded prospectively on patients with limited co-morbidity and age ≤ 80 years undergoing CBE for histologically proven HGD or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> within ≤ C3M5 segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic resection was performed by standardized protocol every 6 - 8 weeks until CBE was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>Esophageal dilation</z:mp> was performed when patients reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> scores were recorded at scheduled endoscopic surveillance or by telephone interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By intention-to-treat analysis, complete eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was achieved in 95 % and 82 %, respectively, in 77 patients undergoing a median of 2 resection sessions (interquartile range [IQR] 1 - 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>Esophageal dilation</z:mp> was required in 33 % (median 3 dilations, IQR 1 - 3.5) at median follow-up of 20 months (IQR 6 - 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for dilation requirement were the number of mucosal resections at the index procedure (odds ratio [OR] 1.3 per resection, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.0 - 1.9; P = 0.043) and maximal extent of the Barrett's segment (OR 2.2 per cm, 95 %CI 1.2 - 3.9; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although CBE is highly effective in the treatment of Barrett's HGD and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the risk of post-CBE <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> increases with the maximal extent of the Barrett's segment and the number of mucosal resections at the index procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data could be used to inform treatment decisions and identify those patients who may benefit from prophylactic therapies such as dilation </plain></SENT>
