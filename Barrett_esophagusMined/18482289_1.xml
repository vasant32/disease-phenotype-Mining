<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed at comparing adherence to guidelines and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> detection rates in medical centres (MC) and community practices (CP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> histologically confirmed Barrett cases seen over a 3-year period in six MC and 19 CP covering a third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> upper gastrointestinal endoscopies (n = 126,000) performed annually in Berlin, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Rate of relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or more) in both settings in relation to adherence to standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1317 Barrett cases, 66% were seen in CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CP patients had a shorter mean Barrett length (2.6 cm vs. 3.8 cm; P &lt; 0.001) with fewer biopsies taken during an examination (2.5 vs. 4.1 for Barrett length &lt;or=2 cm; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CPs also provided fewer complete esophagogastroduodenoscopy documentation (25.1% vs. 57.8%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasias</z:hpo> were found more commonly in MCs compared to CPs (9.2% vs. 0.8%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, on exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> referred patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (65%) or those examined for other reasons (27.5%), the detection rate at MCs decreased to 1.3%, not different from the one seen at CPs (0.8%, P = 0.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 13% were found during surveillance, but 57% were diagnosed at an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Referral bias and not better adherence to guidelines could explain the higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> prevalence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> at hospital centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite a generally poor adherence to guidelines, most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> found were at an early and potentially curable stage </plain></SENT>
