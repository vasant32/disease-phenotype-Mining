<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have been reported almost exclusively in the radiologic and clinical literature as occurring predominantly in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive histologic and clinicopathologic evaluation of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, their association with background mucosal pathology, and their association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has not been previously performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> from 27 patients and characterized the histologic, endoscopic, and clinical features of both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and the background esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>Hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> were most common in the region of the EGJ (67%), followed by the distal esophagus (30%) and mid-esophagus (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most (80%) were composed of predominantly cardiac-type mucosa, predominantly squamous mucosa (17%), or an admixture (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> was present in only 7% and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in only 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the majority of cases (67%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> were associated with concurrent or recent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> or erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In most cases (48%) esophageal injury was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, but other potential etiologies included medications, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, anastomotic or polypectomy sites, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients (15%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, three of whom had or developed dysplastic Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results underscore the pathogenesis of esophageal/EGJ region <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> as a mucosal regenerative response to surrounding mucosal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Careful clinical history and biopsy of the nonpolypoid mucosa are essential for determining the clinicopathologic context in which the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> have developed </plain></SENT>
