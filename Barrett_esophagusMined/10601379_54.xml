<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Abnormalities involving the p16 (also known as cyclin-dependent kinase N2 [CDKN2], p16 [INK4a], or MTS1) and p53 (also known as TP53) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes are highly prevalent in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 9p21 and 17p13 chromosomes (locations for p16 and p53 genes, respectively) is frequently observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied extensively the distribution and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of LOH at 9p and 17p chromosomes throughout the Barrett's segment in patients who have not yet developed esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 404 samples from 61 consecutive patients enrolled in the Seattle <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> Study from February 1995 through September 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> but no diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The samples were assayed for LOH at 9p and 17p chromosomes after amplification of genomic DNA by use of polymerase chain reaction and DNA genotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cell fractions were purified by flow cytometry on the basis of DNA content and proliferation-associated antigen labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Association between LOH at 9p and LOH at 17p with flow cytometric abnormalities was determined by chi-squared test, and logistic regression models were used to model and test for the extent to which a particular genotype was found in 2-cm intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS: LOH at 9p and 17p chromosomes are highly prevalent somatic genetic lesions in premalignant Barrett's tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LOH at 9p is more common than LOH at 17p in diploid samples and can be detected over greater regions of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In most patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the Barrett's mucosa contains a mosaic of clones and subclones with different patterns of LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some clones had expanded to involve extensive regions of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LOH at 9p and 17p chromosomes may be useful biomarkers to stratify patients' risk of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
