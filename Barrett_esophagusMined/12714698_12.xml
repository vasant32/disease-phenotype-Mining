<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated TP53 mutation patterns in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0152018" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers of the esophagus</z:e> and cardia of patients coming from Lower Normandy, a region situated in the highest incidence area in Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To screen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples, we first used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), a well-characterized technique which constituted our reference method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then the results were compared with those obtained by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), a recent and automatic screening technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the TP53 mutations profile showed that the detected alterations were mainly point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven percent (33/34) of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> samples presented at least one mutation or polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of somatic, non-silent and sequence-confirmed mutations was 76% (26/34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common substitutions were G--&gt;A transitions, which could be related to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35803">nitrosamines</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15343,43923">acetaldehyde</z:chebi> or factors prone to producing mucosal irritation, like hot beverages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>G--&gt;T transversions, which were also frequently detected, could originate from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29865">benzo[a]pyrene</z:chebi> in tobacco smoke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A--&gt;T transversions were not revealed in our series, which constitutes a discordance with mutational spectra already performed in north-western France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concerning <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and cardia, the alteration frequency was 69% (11/16), with a majority of G--&gt;A transitions at CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They are probably related to endogenous process mediated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The main advantage provided by DHPLC was its ease of application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the optimization steps turned out to be quite critical, especially for sequences with high melting temperatures embedded in lower melting temperature fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Considering only the common sequences analyzed by the two techniques, four of the 46 positive samples detected by DGGE were not revealed by DHPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This result stresses the limited sensitivity of DHPLC compared with DGGE under the conditions described in this study </plain></SENT>
