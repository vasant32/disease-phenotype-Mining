<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> was studied in the distal and proximal esophagus of control patients (without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, but with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810319" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other gastrointestinal disorders</z:e>), of patients with various grades of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>), and in patients who had a Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> was assessed by chemiluminescence, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (LP), and by measuring <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Chemiluminescence and LP increased with the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and was highest in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; SOD decreased with damage, except in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> associated with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chemiluminescence and LP in reflux patients were higher in the distal than in the proximal esophagus, and SOD was lower, whereas no such difference was found in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings after Nissen fundoplication were similar to those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> is mediated by free radicals depleting SOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a severe form of oxidative damage; in some patients, high SOD levels may prevent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
