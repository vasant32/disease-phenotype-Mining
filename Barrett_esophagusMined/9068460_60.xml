<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>S. is declining, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> localized to the gastric cardia has risen dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not yet clear whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333763" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the gastric cardia</z:e> arises from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of IM involving the cardia in patients presenting for elective EGD, and evaluate potential associated factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 7 month period patients referred for elective EGD at the Tucson VA Medical Center were invited to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to EGD each patient was surveyed with regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms and smoking and alcohol history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During EGD note was made of the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>, and Barrett's-appearing mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The esophagogastric junction (EGJ) was defined as the end of the tubular esophagus coinciding with the proximal heads of the gastric folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven biopsies were taken from specific sites in the antrum, angularis, cardia, and EGJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were stained with a combination of H &amp; E and Alcian blue at a pH of 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologic evidence of IM was defined as columnar-type epithelium including goblet cells staining with Alcian blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients were also evaluated for H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by histologic and serologic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 104 patients (99 male, 5 female) with a mean age of 61.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four (23%) were found to have IM involving the gastric cardia, although none of these had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (11%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; however, only 2 of these had concomitant IM of the cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 9 of the 24 with IM of the cardia had concomitant IM elsewhere in the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients (47%) were found to be positive for H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and there was a significant association between H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and IM of the gastric cardia (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show that IM of the gastric cardia is a relatively common finding and is associated with H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was not identified, long-term follow-up studies will be necessary to determine the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> developing from IM of the cardia </plain></SENT>
