<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Effective esophageal peristalsis is a major determinant of esophageal clearance function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relation of esophageal body function with a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter and the development of esophageal mucosal injury in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the relations among the manometrically determined esophageal clearance function, lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction, esophageal acid exposure, and the presence and severity of esophageal mucosal injury in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> values for the manometric assessment of esophageal clearance function were established in 50 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and subsequently applied to 160 symptomatic patients with increased esophageal exposure to gastric juice and various grades of esophageal mucosal injury (no minimal surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, stricture, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Defective clearance function was present in 47.5% of the patients; a defective lower esophageal sphincter was documented in 63.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compromised esophageal clearance function was significantly more common in patients with a defective lower esophageal sphincter than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sphincter function (55% versus 33.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Esophageal acid exposure time and the prevalence and severity of esophageal mucosal injury were highest in patients with a defective sphincter and compromised clearance function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show that esophageal motor function deteriorates with increasing severity of mucosal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This appears to be due to persistent reflux of gastric juice across a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may influence the choice and outcome of antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical correction of a mechanically defective sphincter before the loss of esophageal body function is advocated </plain></SENT>
