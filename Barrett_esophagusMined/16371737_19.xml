<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: BE is a complication of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is considered a major risk factor for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, which may develop through stages from nondysplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presently, there are no recommended therapeutic guidelines for patients with LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1998 through 2003, 6592 patients underwent upper endoscopy; 327 of 6592 (5%) patients had BE, and 35 of 327 (10.7%) had LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients with LGD were treated with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi>, and 16 patients underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic and histologic follow-up was available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We used multiple logistic regression to examine the effect of the 2 treatments on regression of LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LGD was predominant in men (male-to-female ratio: 1.7:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 58 +/- 13.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of patients had no endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A regression from LGD to BE was observed in 12 of 19 (63.2%) patients in the medical group and in 15 of 16 (93.8%) patients in the surgical group (statistically significant difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that surgical treatment may be more effective than medical therapy to modify the natural history of LGD in patients with BE, perhaps because it not only controls acid but also biliopancreatic reflux into the esophagus </plain></SENT>
