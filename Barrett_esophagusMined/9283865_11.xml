<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The "gold standard" and only accurate method for diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is by esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the ability of high-resolution endoluminal sonography (HRES) to detect the mucosal changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients with documented Barrett's and 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls underwent endoscopy with HRES examination using a 20 MHz ultrasound transducer to evaluate for mucosal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HRES examinations were videotaped then reviewed by an unblinded investigator to identify criteria possibly diagnostic of Barrett's and then by a blinded investigator to test the validity of these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Barrett's was diagnosed by HRES if the second hypoechoic layer appeared thicker than the first hyperechoic layer of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> mucosa was defined as having a pencil-thin second hypoechoic layer on HRES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the second hypoechoic layer were made using a computer and compared in patients with Barrett's and patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 17 patients with Barrett's were correctly identified by HRES (sensitivity 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten of 12 controls were correctly identified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (specificity 86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was good correlation between HRES and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathologic diagnoses</z:e> (r 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The second hypoechoic layer was significantly thicker in Barrett's patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HRES is a sensitive new method for identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> could not be identified by HRES in this study </plain></SENT>
