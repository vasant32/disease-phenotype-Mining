<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We followed patients who received RFA for BE containing HGIN and/or early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> for 5 y, to determine the durability of treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We followed 54 patients with BE (2 to 12 cm), previously enrolled in 4 consecutive cohort studies in which they underwent focal endoscopic resection in case of visible lesions (n=40, 72%), followed by serial RFA every 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent high-resolution endoscopy with narrow-band imaging at 6 and 12 months after treatment and then annually for 5 y (median 61 months; interquartile range, 53-65 months); random biopsy samples were collected from neosquamous epithelium and gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 5 y, endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic resection of neosquamous epithelium were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included sustained complete remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (CR-neo) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CR-IM), IM in gastric cardia, or buried glands in neosquamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 5 y, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed sustained CR-neo and CR-IM in 90% of patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> recurred in 3 patients and was managed endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Focal IM in the cardia was found in 19/54 patients (35%), in 53/1143 gastric cardia biopsies (4.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of IM of the cardia did not increase over time; and IM was diagnosed based in only a single biopsy in 89% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Buried glands were detected in 3/3543 neosquamous epithelium biopsies (0.08%, from 3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No endoscopic resection samples had buried glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who have undergone RFA, with or without endoscopic resection, for neoplastic BE, 90% of patients remain in remission after 5 y FU with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recurrences managed endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This treatment approach is therefore an effective and durable alternative to esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
