<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report presents long-term follow-up data after photodynamic therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, or early stage <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Porfimer-photodynamic therapy was performed in 103 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Nd:YAG laser was used to photoablate small areas of residual or untreated Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acid suppression was maintained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi>, 20 mg twice a day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 50.65 (SD 20.57) months (range 2-122 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the 82 patients not lost to follow-up, mean follow-up was 58.5 (12.89) months (range 41-132 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After photodynamic therapy, the length of Barrett's mucosa decreased by a mean of 6.92 cm (range 1-22 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 65 patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 60 (94%) had elimination of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three (4.6%) patients developed subsquamous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsquamous, nondysplastic, metaplastic epithelium was found in 4 patients (4.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strictures occurred in 18% with one session of photodynamic therapy, and 50% with two treatments, 30% overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the 103 patients, intention-to-treat success rates were 92.9%, 77.5%, and 44.4% for, respectively, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and early stage <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Porfimer-photodynamic therapy with supplemental Nd:YAG photoablation and continuous treatment with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> reduces the length of Barrett's mucosa, eliminates high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and, by comparison with historical data, may reduce the expected frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
