<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) were enrolled into a prospective, randomized crossover trial of MB-directed biopsy versus conventional biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (19 long-segment CLE; 28 short-segment CLE) were enrolled and underwent MB-directed biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of MB for specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were 53% and 51%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of MB for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were 51% and 48%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients (15 long-segment CLE; 20 short-segment CLE) completed the crossover trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative frequencies for specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were 73% and 71% from MB-directed and conventional biopsy specimens, respectively (p = 0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative frequencies for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were 20% and 18% from MB-directed and conventional biopsy specimens, respectively (p = 0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with long-segment CLE, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was diagnosed in 10 patients with MB and 7 patients with conventional biopsy methods (p = 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of biopsy specimens per EGD was greater with MB, which may have influenced the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was indefinite/low in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the dysplastic specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results of MB-directed biopsy were similar to conventional biopsy in detecting specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and indefinite/low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MB was not useful in short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
