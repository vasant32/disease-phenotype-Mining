<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Usually, this entity is an asymmetrical columnar-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of varying extent, with an unsharp epithelial junction line cranial, and showing various large residual islands of squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, usually well-developed peptic lesions are also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More rarely seen are cases with a longer, symmetrical, cranially sharply delimited columnar-epithelial-lined segment, in which peptic lesions and strictures are usually either restricted to the proximal section, or are lacking altogether </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among more than 100 patients presenting with endobrachy-oesophagus, 14 cases had the latter form of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven had a solitary, high peptic stricture, and only 50% unequivocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four patients there were no inflammatory changes at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients, fundic glands were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest was the segment-like arrangement of cardiac and fundic glands in 2 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In only a single case were scar formations seen in the columnar-lined segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considered from the point of view of our embryological knowledge, certain forms of endobrachy-oesophagus would appear to represent a congenital anomaly </plain></SENT>
