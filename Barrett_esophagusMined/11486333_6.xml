<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of fractionating the 633 nm illumination of 5-aminolaevulinic (ALA)-based photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat oesophagus was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fractionation of the illumination could enhance the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> effect in two ways: (a) delay of the vascular shutdown or relaxation of the vasoconstriction induced by ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and (b) use of newly formed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi>), produced during the dark interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty rats were randomly allocated to two groups of 20 animals each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study vascular effects, in group 1 illumination with 633 nm (100 mW/cm) was performed at 3 h after oral ALA administration (200 mg/kg) either continuously with 20 J/cm diffuser length (n = 5) or fractionated 2 x 10 J/cm with a 150 s interval (n = 5), five animals served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood flow was measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To study the effect of renewed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> forming, animals in group 2 were illuminated continuously at 3 h after ALA with 20 J/cm (n = 5) or 40 J/cm (n = 5) or fractionated 2 x 20 J/cm with a 3 h interval (n = 5), five animals served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals the in vivo fluence rate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> fluorescence were measured during illuminations and animals were killed at 48 h after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> did not cause any significant vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence measurements and dosimetric results in group 1 did not differ between animals illuminated continuously or fractionated with a 150 s interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group 2, during a 3 h dark interval, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> fluorescence increased and was bleached during the second illumination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The tissue optical properties changed during the 3 h dark interval, resulting in a lower in vivo fluence rate (p &lt; or = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fractionation did not result in more oesophageal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that a 150 s interval during illumination in ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> does not increase oesophageal blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During an interval of 3 h new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> is formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the present study, fractionated illumination using short or long time intervals did not result in more damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study shows no evidence for improved <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> effect with fractionated light delivery </plain></SENT>
