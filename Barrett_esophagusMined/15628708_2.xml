<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic practice consumes a large proportion of gastroenterology-related health expenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An economic comparison of several currently accepted endoscopic practices was performed, ranking them according their cost-effectiveness, as viewed from the payer perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness of four currently accepted standard endoscopic practices was examined: small bowel biopsy to assess for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac sprue</z:e>, colonoscopic biopsy to assess for microscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (CUC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parameter estimates were obtained from the published literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Charges were based on Medicare professional plus facility/technical fees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Performing colonoscopic biopsies for microscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nonbloody <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> was the most cost-effective practice ($2447/case detected), while small bowel biopsy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205707" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sprue</z:e> in the setting of a patient with a first-degree relative with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205707" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sprue</z:e> ($3042/case detected) or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> ($2982/case detected) was also a cost-effective approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small bowel biopsy in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> ($3900/case detected) was less cost-effective, while CUC surveillance ($14,119/detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) and performance of small bowel biopsy in an asymptomatic patient ($15,209/case detected) were clearly the least economical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As efforts are made to reduce the costs of health care, more attention will be focused on the cost-effectiveness of routine endoscopic practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although, our findings put endoscopic practices into economic perspective, future perspective, future prospective trials are required to confirm the validity of these findings </plain></SENT>
