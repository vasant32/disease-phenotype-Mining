<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To establish the prevalence of CD44 protein expression in a large surgical series of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_481'>preneoplastic lesions</z:mpath> and to correlate this expression with clinicopathological data and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: CD44H and variants (V4/V5, V6) expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed, paraffin wax tissue samples of Barrett's mucosa (50) and Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (73) obtained from surgical resections from 73 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This expression was correlated with pathological features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD44H and V6 expression was found in 62% and 55% of Barrett's specialized mucosa negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and in 70% and 63% of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD44H and V6 expression was restricted to the lower part of the crypts in Barrett's specialized mucosa negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and reached the upper part of the crypts in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant relation was found between CD44V6 expression and depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> invasion in the oesophageal wall (P = 0.05), neoplastic vascular invasion (P = 0.0001), neoplastic perineural invasion (P = 0.0004) and stage in Rosenberg's classification (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers</z:e> with CD44V6 expression had a significantly poorer prognosis (5-year survival: 17%) than those without (5-year survival: 44%) (P = 0.02) in univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, multivariate analysis showed that CD44V6 expression had no independent prognostic value when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> invasion and lymph node involvement were taken as explanatory variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CD44H and V6 are frequently expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pattern of expression that we observed from mucosa negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> suggests that CD44H and V6 may be involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD44V6 expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is correlated to aggressive pathological features </plain></SENT>
