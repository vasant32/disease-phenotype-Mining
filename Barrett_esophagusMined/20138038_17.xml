<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The molecular mechanism underlying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_162'>epithelial metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recognizing that Hedgehog signaling is required for early esophageal development, we sought to determine if the Hedgehog pathway is reactivated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and if genes downstream of the pathway could promote columnar differentiation of esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze clinical specimens, human esophageal cell lines, and mouse esophagi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human esophageal squamous epithelial (HET-1A) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OE33) cells were subjected to acid treatment and used in transfection experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Swiss Webster mice were used in a surgical model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An in vivo transplant culture system was created using esophageal epithelium from Sonic hedgehog transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Marked up-regulation of Hedgehog ligand expression, which can be induced by acid or bile exposure, occurs frequently in Barrett's epithelium and is associated with stromal expression of the Hedgehog target genes PTCH1 and BMP4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BMP4 signaling induces expression of SOX9, an intestinal crypt transcription factor, which is highly expressed in Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further show that expression of Deleted in Malignant <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>Brain Tumors</z:mp> 1, the human homologue of the columnar cell factor Hensin, occurs in Barrett's epithelium and is induced by SOX9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, transgenic expression of Sonic hedgehog in mouse esophageal epithelium induces expression of stromal Bmp4, epithelial Sox9, and columnar cytokeratins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Epithelial Hedgehog ligand expression may contribute to the initiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> through induction of stromal BMP4, which triggers reprogramming of esophageal epithelium in favor of a columnar phenotype </plain></SENT>
