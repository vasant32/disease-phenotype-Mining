<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic catheter bipolar RF ablation is a new technique for ablation of neoplastic tissue in the bile duct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of RF power on bile duct and solid organ histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Nonsurvival animal study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved 4 Yorkshire farm swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: After we made a midline laparotomy incision, a bipolar RF catheter was placed with 3 power (5, 7, 10 W) and voltage settings (66, 132, 190 V) in the bile duct and solid organs (liver, spleen, kidney, and pancreas) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gross and histologic examinations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Depth of ablation in the bile duct wall, characteristics of the ablation in the solid organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An endoscopic bipolar RF catheter produced incomplete (bile duct), patchy ablation (pancreas) with 5 watts, intramural (bile duct) or confluent ablation with 7 watts, and transmural (bile duct) ablation at 10 W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The depth of ablation in the bile duct was 0.9 ± 0.3, 1.5 ± 0.2, 2.3 ± 0.6 mm at 5, 7, and 10 W, respectively (analysis of variance; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histologic ablation was not achieved in the liver, although gross changes were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Animal study, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bile duct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RF energy applied to the bile duct or solid organs resulted in controlled ablation with a linear relationship between the depth of ablation in the bile duct and RF power </plain></SENT>
