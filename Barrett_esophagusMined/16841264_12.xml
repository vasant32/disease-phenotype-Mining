<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of hypotheses have been advanced to explain the rapid increase of the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major problem in identifying and understanding the nature of this increase is the difficulty in untangling age effects from temporal trends due to cohort and period effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this problem, we have developed multi-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> models that describe the age-specific incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and of the gastric cardia with separate adjustments for temporal trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These models explicitly incorporate important features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, such as the metaplastic conversion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We fit these models separately to the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and of the gastric cardia reported in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry over the period 1973-2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the incidence of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> is consistent with a sequence that posits a tissue conversion step in the target organ followed by a multi-stage process with three rate-limiting events, the first two leading to an initiated cell that can expand clonally into a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e>, and the third converting an initiated cell into a malignant cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Temporal trends in the incidence of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> are dominated by dramatically increasing period effects </plain></SENT>
