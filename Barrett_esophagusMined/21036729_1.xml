<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In humans and in baboons, protracted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux</z:e> (GER) transforms the squamous-lined esophagus into columnar-lined (that is Barrett's mucosa, BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alcian blue stain (AB) is used to evidence sialomucin-producing goblet cells in human BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the frequency and distribution of sialomucin-producing cells in BM in baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sections from 137 consecutive baboon esophagi were alternatively stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin (H&amp;E) and with AB (pH 2.5), without counterstain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 137 baboons, 131 (95.6%) had BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Columnar and intramucosal glandular cells produced sialomucin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 131 of these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many BM cells were ballooned and filled with sialomucins, despite goblet cells not being found in H&amp;E sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In humans, protracted GER is a disease requiring medication that may lead to BM; AB stains mainly goblet cells and occasional columnar cells in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In baboons, in contrast, BM is a natural postnatal process of adaptation to GER, triggered by regurgitation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0232604" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">rumination</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AB stains <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> columnar and intra-mucosal glandular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sialomucin-overstuffed cells were more frequent and larger in baboons than in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The extra load of sialomucin in BM might be an integrated part of the postnatal life-long process of adaptation to regurgitation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0232604" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">rumination</z:e> in baboons </plain></SENT>
