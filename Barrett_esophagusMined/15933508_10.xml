<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TNE technique, indications, outcomes, advantages, limitations, and impact on patient care are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Charts of the first 30 patients to undergo TNE in an academic otolaryngology practice were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Technique details, patient demographics, and procedure indications and findings as well as the disposition of patients in this series are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNE limitations are discussed with areas for future development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients who underwent unsedated outpatient TNE by their otolaryngologist are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TNE was directed toward select indications: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, screening esophagoscopy given long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1168250" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngopharyngeal reflux</z:e> (LPR), and esophageal surveillance with a new diagnosis of head and neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positive findings included mucosal cobblestoning, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, candidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100628'>esophageal diverticulum</z:hpo>, postcricoid mass, patulous esophagus, and absence of secondary esophageal peristalsis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included referral to a gastroenterologist for evaluation, with or without biopsy; direct laryngoscopy or esophagoscopy with biopsy by the otolaryngologist; planned <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> resection by the otolaryngologist; and medical management of GER/LPR by the otolaryngologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate selection criteria, TNE yields a high percentage of positive findings and wide range of esophageal abnormalities, directly impacting patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Available to otolaryngologists in the outpatient setting, TNE expedites interventions by providing a safe, effective alternative to rigid esophagoscopy under general anesthesia and flexible upper endoscopy with sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients will benefit from the integration of TNE into otolaryngologists' outpatient diagnostic armamentarium </plain></SENT>
