<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, an inducible form of COX, has been implicated in both <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e> on COX-2 expression in cultured esophageal cells and tissue, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunoblotting and Northern blotting were used to assess the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> on COX-2 expression in esophageal cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e> on COX-2 expression and cell proliferation in esophageal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unconjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> were about fivefold more potent inducers of COX-2 messenger <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, COX-2 protein, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis than conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Acidifying the culture medium sensitized esophageal cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>-mediated induction of COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The induction of COX-2 by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> was mediated by phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In experimental animals, duodenoesophageal reflux led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, marked thickening of the esophageal mucosa, and enhanced expression of COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased immunoreactivity for Ki-67 and cyclin D1 indicated that enhanced cell proliferation contributed to mucosal thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reflux of duodenal contents into the esophagus led to increased COX-2 expression and mucosal thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">Bile acids</z:chebi> are likely to contribute to these effects </plain></SENT>
