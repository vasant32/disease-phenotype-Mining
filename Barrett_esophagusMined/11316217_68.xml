<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated COX-2 mRNA but variable protein expression has been demonstrated in Barrett's epithelium, and we have, therefore, sought to evaluate the expression of COX-2 protein throughout the Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paraffin-embedded esophageal biopsies from 56 different patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were analyzed for COX-2 expression by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty contained nondysplastic intestinal and <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp>, 12 demonstrated low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), 12 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and 12 contained invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Epithelial expression of COX-2 protein was detected in 75% (15/20) of benign cases, 83% (10/12) of cases with LGD, and 100% of cases with HGD or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a semiquantitative analysis, median staining scores for the groups were 2, 3, 14, and 13, respectively (scale 0-16), with the expression being significantly higher in the HGD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> groups compared to benign and LGD groups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates clear COX-2 expression in the epithelial cells in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, confirms elevated expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and shows that the elevation in expression occurs in the progression from LGD to HGD </plain></SENT>
