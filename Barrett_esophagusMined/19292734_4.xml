<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the role of HER2 overexpression/amplification in predicting the conversion from precursor lesions to <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated by univariate analysis of single variables clinical records and histological specimens of 21 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of BO and/or oesophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical variables included age, gender, alcohol and smoking intake, presence of symptoms (pyrosis, disphagia) and endoscopic features (length) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HER2 status was studied by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on paraffin-embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The end-points were the occurrence of progression and the time-to-progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) from the initial histologic lesion to the worst pathological pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median age at diagnosis was 63 years (range 37-84) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Progression occurred in 11 of 21 patients and median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HER2 was overexpressed/amplified in 8 of 21 (38%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HER2 overexpression/ amplification and the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were statistically associated with progression (P= 0.038) </plain></SENT>
