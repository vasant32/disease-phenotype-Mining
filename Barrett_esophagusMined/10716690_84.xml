<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Eradication of Barrett's mucosa by thermal or photoablation combined with high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> is a potentially attractive strategy in the management of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282313" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preneoplastic condition</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, major concerns of this method are the persistence of residual metaplastic glands beneath the new squamous epithelium and the absence of any knowledge of its impact on long term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: The case of an intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> diagnosed 18 months after apparently complete squamous re-epithelialisation achieved using <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation and high dose <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (40 mg/daily) is reported in a 68 year old patient presenting initially with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was located under the new squamous layer and presented as a bulging area covered by the squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It probably originates from residual metaplastic glands after therapy although a pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cannot be definitely excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This observation might question future application of this experimental endotherapy in non-dysplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It suggests that the residual glands might still be premalignant and that the early diagnosis of neoplastic changes might be compromised by the squamous re-epithelialisation </plain></SENT>
