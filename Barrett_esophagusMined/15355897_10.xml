<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>-associated antigens (MAGEs) are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific antigens recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, expression of MAGE family A members was evaluated during the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) as potential targets for immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MAGE-A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was evaluated in 46 samples including Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and EA using oligonucleotide microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of MAGE-A proteins was confirmed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays containing 59 EA, 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 9 BM samples and by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate MAGE-A10 expression, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products were sequenced, and protein expression was determined using a specific antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overexpression of MAGE-A1, MAGE-A2b, MAGE-A3, MAGE-A4, MAGE-A6, MAGE-A9, MAGE-A10, and MAGE-A12 was found in EAs relative to BM on oligonucleotide microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAGE-A3 overexpression was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in 21.4% (6 of 28) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray revealed MAGE-A proteins in 20.3% (12 of 59) of EAs and MAGE-A10 staining in 16.9% (10 of 59) of EAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAGE-A expression was confirmed by Western blot in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumors</z:e> and in two EA cell lines, Flo-1 and Seg-1, whereas Flo-1 also expressed MAGE-A10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> produced from these cell lines in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice retained MAGE-A expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, RT-PCR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> expressing MAGE-A10 protein revealed additional PCR products that were identified as novel MAGE-A10 alternative splice variants using DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of these MAGE-A10 alternative splice sequences, and characterization of MAGE-A expression may provide potential targets for immunotherapy in patients with EA </plain></SENT>
