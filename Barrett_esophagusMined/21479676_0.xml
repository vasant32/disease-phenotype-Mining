<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the esophageal biopsies from patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and their relationships with endoscopic grading and histologic grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety individuals were recruited (30 RE, 30 BE, and 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control) and underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with esophageal biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to semi-quantitatively detect the expression of IFN-γ and IL-4 in the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IFN-γ was overexpressed in BE and RE compared with the control (P &lt; 0.01), whereas IL-4 was up-regulated in BE compared with RE and control (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between the level of IFN-γ and the endoscopic grading (r = 0.509, P &lt; 0.01) and histologic grading of RE (r = 0.493, P &lt; 0.01) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Th1 and Th2 immune responses play different roles in the development of RE and BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Th1 immune response is the major pathway for RE development, whereas both Th1 and Th2 immune responses are implicated in BE pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of IFN-γ is associated with the endoscopic and histologic grading of RE </plain></SENT>
