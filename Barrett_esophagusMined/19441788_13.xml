<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glycomic profiling of blood serum, in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell proteins or their fragments with altered glycosylation patterns are shed, could reveal the altered glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed glycomic profiling of serum from patients with no known disease (N = 18), patients with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD, N = 11) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (N = 5), and patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC, N = 50) in an attempt to delineate distinct differences in glycosylation between these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative intensities of 98 features were significantly different among the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onsets</z:hpo>; 26 of these correspond to known glycan structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The changes in the relative intensities of three of the known glycan structures predicted esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with 94% sensitivity and better than 60% specificity as determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that comparative glycomic profiling of EAC reveals a subset of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> that can be selected as candidate biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These markers can differentiate disease-free from HGD, disease-free from EAC, and HGD from EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical utility of these glycan biomarkers requires further validation </plain></SENT>
