<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy is considered the gold standard for the treatment of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and for noninvasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (ACA) of the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the metaplastic epithelium is removed, the patient is considered "cured" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite this, BE has been reported in patients who have previously undergone esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is often debated whether this is "new" BE or the result of an esophagectomy that did not include a sufficiently proximal margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine if BE recurred in esophagectomy patients where the entire segment of BE had been removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records were searched for patients who had undergone esophagectomy for cure at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Records were reviewed for surgical, endoscopic, and histopathologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients in whom we have endoscopic follow-up are the subjects of this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Since 1995, 45 patients have undergone esophagectomy for cure for Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or localized ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six of these 45 patients underwent endoscopy after surgery including 8/45 patients (18%) with recurrent Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> after curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> after esophagectomy was common in our patients who underwent at least one endoscopy after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This appears to represent the development of metachronous disease after complete resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Half of these patients have required subsequent treatment thus far, either repeat surgery or photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results support the use of endoscopic surveillance in patients who have undergone "curative" esophagectomy for Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796563,C1334407" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">localized cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
