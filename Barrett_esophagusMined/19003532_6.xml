<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population comprised 869 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed based on the Prague C &amp; M Criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlations of clinical factors with the prevalence and progression of endoscopic Barrett's epithelium were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopic Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed in 374 cases (43%), in the majority of which the diagnosis was short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The progression of Barrett's epithelium was identified in 47 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses, aging, smoking habit, and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were significantly associated with the prevalence of Barrett's epithelium, whereas aging and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, especially severe erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, were significant contributing factors to the progression of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Forty-three percent of the total study population was diagnosed as having endoscopic Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, 12.6% of the cases with Barrett's epithelium exhibited progression which was associated with aging and severe erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
