<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is characterized by the presence of specialized columnar epithelium (SCE) in the distal esophagus and is a precursor for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">Methylene blue</z:chebi> is used to selectively stain this type of epithelium within the columnar lined distal esophagus (CLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of our prospective study was to investigate the staining pattern with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> in patients with visible CLE and a control group with macroscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chromoendoscopy of the distal esophagus with 1% <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> was performed on a total of 73 patients (51 with visible CLE, 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were targeted toward stained or macroscopically abnormal mucosal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unstained CLE was sampled by obtaining 4-quadrant biopsy specimens at 2 cm intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The targeted biopsy of stained areas provided histologic proof of SCE with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detection of SCE increased with this method in patients with visible CLE (75%), but SCE was also prevalent in the control group (73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Areas that by their appearance raised a suspicion for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were already endoscopically apparent in 3 of 4 cases before <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> staining and showed different staining patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">Methylene blue</z:chebi> staining increases the rate of detection of SCE, both in patients with visible CLE and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For detection of dysplastic or malignant areas it is important to look for visible mucosal changes </plain></SENT>
