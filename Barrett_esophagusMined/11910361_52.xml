<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CDKN2A promoter hypermethylation was studied by methylation sensitive single-strand conformation analysis and sequencing using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> modified DNA in Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the lesions of interest were sampled by microdissection from paraffin-embedded fixed tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No methylation of the CDKN2A promoter was found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous cell epithelia, whereas methylation was detected in 18 of 22 (82%) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and 10 of 33 (30%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e>, including 4 of 12 (33%) samples with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LOH at the CDKN2A gene locus was found in 68% of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and in 55% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 28 samples without p16 immunoreactivity, 25 (89%) showed CDKN2A promoter hypermethylation with or without LOH of CDKN2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 2 (8%) samples expressing p16 protein were found to be methylated; these showed a mixture of completely methylated and unmethylated CDKN2A promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 7 of 19 (37%) informative samples without LOH of CDKN2A, the CDKN2A promoter was found to be methylated at both alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Loss of p16 protein expression was strongly associated with CDKN2A promoter hypermethylation (P &lt; 0.00001), but not with LOH (P = 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that methylation of the CDKN2A promoter is the predominant mechanism for p16 inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This hypermethylation is a very common event in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and occurs as early as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
