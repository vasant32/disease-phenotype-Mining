<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the difference of gene expression profiles between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> induced by gastroduodenoesophageal reflux in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were treated esophagoduodenostomy to produce gastroduodenoesophageal reflux, and another group received sham operation as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Esophageal epithelial tissues were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately for pathology 40 wk after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression profiles of 4 096 genes in reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> tissues were compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium by cDNA microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-eight genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were more than three times different from those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium, including 312 up-regulated and 136 down-regulated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and thirty-two genes in RE were more than three times different from those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium, 90 up-regulated and 142 down-regulated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, there were 214 up-regulated and 142 down-regulated genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Esophageal epithelium exposed excessively to harmful ingredients of duodenal and gastric reflux can develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The gene expression level is different between reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and the differentially expressed genes might be related to the occurrence and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and the promotion or progression in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
