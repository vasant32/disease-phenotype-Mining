<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were to determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in patients with LPR using transnasal esophagoscopy (TNE) and to determine if there is agreement between TNE clinical findings and pathology results when using TNE for Barrett's screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: This study involved a retrospective review of the records of 200 consecutive patients with LPR undergoing esophageal screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prevalence of patients with findings clinically suspicious for Barrett's and the biopsy results for those patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 200 patients with LPR who were screened with TNE, 10% (20 of 200) had findings suspicious for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and, of those, only 30% (six of 20) had biopsy-proven Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although TNE may be a useful screening tool for Barrett's, there is incongruence between TNE findings and biopsy results, which likely reflects suboptimal biopsy methods with TNE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>New biopsy techniques such as the CDx brush biopsy may enhance the sensitivity of TNE biopsies, and future studies are needed in this area </plain></SENT>
