<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ablation using the HALO system has shown promise for the treatment of BE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a stepwise regimen of circumferential and focal ablation using the HALO system for the treatment of BE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BE patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary circumferential ablation was followed every 3 months by further circumferential ablation or focal ablation until complete endoscopic eradication of BE was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 3- or 6-month intervals, depending on baseline grade, targeted and four quadrant random biopsies were obtained to assess the histological response to ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A complete response (CR) is defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsies negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) (CR-IM) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (CR-D) at last available follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were treated (57 men; median age 71 years; median BE length 5 cm), with worst grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> being LGD (n=39) and HGD (n=24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up is available for 62 patients (median 24 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, CR-IM is 79% and CR-D is 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the LGD cohort, CR-IM is 87% and CR-D is 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the HGD cohort, CR-IM is 67% and CR-D is 79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stepwise circumferential and focal ablation of BE containing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> appears to be a safe and effective intervention, achieving a CR for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 95% and 79% of LGD and HGD patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
