<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 18 cases that were heterozygous (informative) for APC, LOH was found in none of 14 SE samples, 2 of 8 LGD samples, 3 of 11 HGD samples, and 5 of 17 CA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, markedly reduced expression of APC protein (&lt; 50% positive cells) was found in 3 of 19 HGD samples and 4 of 35 CA samples but not in SE or LGD samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 17 cases informative for the MCC gene, LOH was detectable in 1 of 14 SE samples, none of 7 LGD samples, none of 9 HGD samples, and 4 of 16 CA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allelic loss of APC and/or loss of APC protein expression occurs earlier in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> than LOH in the MCC gene </plain></SENT>
