<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously presented an experimental model of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus by demonstrating that esophagojejunostomy combined with subcutaneous injection of 2,6-dimethylnitrosomorpholine in Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was devised to investigate the influence of pancreatic and biliary duodenal-content reflux on the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three groups of 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were controls: the first was exposed to pancreatic reflux, the second to biliary reflux, and the third to both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other three experimental groups were similar except that a 1/100 LD50 dose of 2,6-dimethylnitrosomorpholine was injected subcutaneously weekly, starting on day 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus was induced only in animals receiving the carcinogen after exposure to either pancreatic reflux (3/22, 13%) or pancreatic and biliary reflux (9/27, 33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Half of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and half were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that under these experimental conditions, in which the carcinogen is used in a low dose, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> is induced only when pancreatic secretions are present in the duodenal-content reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biliary reflux, however, appears to exert a cocarcinogenic effect when combined with pancreatic secretions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical relevance of these findings needs further evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conceivably, the elimination of pancreatic and biliary duodenal-content reflux in patients with documented Barrett's mucosa may inhibit the progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
