<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the inter-observer agreement and validity of the LA Classification in scoring the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in Asian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Video endoscopy clips were selected from 45 consecutive patients participating in reflux studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The videos were viewed by endoscopists who then independently scored the presence, severity and distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, including endoscopically suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (ESBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each video was discussed and a consensus on findings reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kappa (k) correlation was calculated to describe inter-observer agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five clips were scored (no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> 20%, grade-A 54%, grade-B 23%, grade-C 3%, respectively and 10 clips were excluded for poor imaging) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excellent agreement was noted on the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (mean k = 0.79, range 0.77-0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (42%) had ESBE with a mean k of 0.48 (range 0.39-0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inter-observer agreement on the LA grade was good (mean k = 0.58, range 0.55-0.63), whilst in agreement between endoscopists and consensus grading, the mean kappa rose to 0.77 (range 0.73-0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a trend of increasing agreement as viewings progressed, with superior kappa correlation after 16 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> showed good k values using the alternative approach of grouping by circumferential extent (mean k = 0.64, range 0.60-0.67) at the lower categories of severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Scoring using the LA classification for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and the concurrence on the presence of ESBE showed moderate to strong agreement amongst Asian endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results also suggested that an alternative method of scoring <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> based on proportion of circumferential involvement was reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A learning effect was observed and reliable scoring was achieved after 16 patients </plain></SENT>
