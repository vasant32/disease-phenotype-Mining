<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>)-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a significant number of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in the vicinity of the esophagogastric junction are seen in the background of gastric/cardiac-type mucosa without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (intestinal-type mucosa) in the classification and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological and molecular characteristics were examined in 157 consecutively resected <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction and were compared between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> arising in association with intestinal-type and cardiac-type mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intestinal-type mucosa-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were more likely to be associated with younger age (P=0.0057), reflux symptoms (P&lt;0.0001), proximal location (P=0.0009), lower T stage (P&lt;0.0001), fewer nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (P=0.0001), absence of lymphatic (P&lt;0.0001), venous (P=0.0060) or perineural (P&lt;0.0001) invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologically, intestinal-type mucosa-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were more likely to be low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_267'>glandular tumors</z:mpath> (P=0.0095) of intestinal or mixed immunophenotype (P=0.015) and express nuclear Î²-catenin (P=0.0080), whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> arising in a background of cardiac-type mucosa were more frequently associated with EGFR amplification (P=0.0051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five-year overall survival rate was significantly higher in patients with intestinal-type mucosa-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (28 vs 9%, P=0.0015), although no survival benefit was seen after adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the theory that multiple distinct pathways of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> exist in the vicinity of the esophagogastric junction, including one in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> arise from dysplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (intestinal pathway), and one potentially involving <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the cardiac-type mucosa (non-intestinal pathway) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are warranted to further clarify their pathogenesis and the molecular mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
