<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the function of the vagal nerves and the gastric reservoir after vagal-sparing esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Esophagectomy as currently performed includes division of the vagal nerves and surgical alteration of the stomach, with attendant postoperative dumping, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, reduced meal capacity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vagal-sparing esophagectomy has been introduced as a technique for removal of the esophagus while preserving the vagal nerves and gastric reservoir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedure is touted as having a low morbidity and is applicable to patients with end-stage benign or early malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A random sample of 15 patients at a median of 20 months after a vagal-sparing esophagectomy was compared to 23 asymptomatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects; 10 randomly selected patients, 29 months after esophagogastrectomy with colon interposition; and 10 randomly selected patients, 47 months after standard esophagectomy with gastric pull-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gastric mucosal acidification was tested with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vagal secretory function was measured by gastric acid output and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> response to sham feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vagal motor function was assessed by a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi> gastric emptying scan and a questionnaire to evaluate dumping and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gastric reservoir function was evaluated by measuring meal capacity and postoperative changes in body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vagal-sparing esophagectomy preserved the function of the vagi, as evident by an increase in gastric acid output, a rise in serum pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> following sham feeding, and preservation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> postoperative gastric emptying in 70% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After vagal-sparing esophagectomy, patients were free of dumping and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and were analogous to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects in meal capacity but had a slight reduction in the speed of eating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vagal-sparing esophagectomy preserves gastric secretory, motor, and reservoir function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, patients have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alimentation, bowel regulation, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is an ideal procedure for patients with end-stage benign disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> limited to the lamina propria </plain></SENT>
