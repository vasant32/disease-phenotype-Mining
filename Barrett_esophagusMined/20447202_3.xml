<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) is at high risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnified endoscopy with narrow band imaging (ME-NBI) can be useful for detecting this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to pit patterns, light blue crests (LBC), blue-whitish patchy areas on the metaplastic epithelia of the stomach, can predict SIM in BE under ME-NBI observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 54 patients with BE underwent ME-NBI to identify IM pits (tubular and villous pits) and LBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples were taken for histological evaluation of IM, immunohistochemical staining for CD10, MUC2 and MUC5AC antigen, transmission electron microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of CD10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IM pit pattern with ME-NBI for the diagnosis of IM yielded acceptable sensitivity, specificity and accuracy at 92%, 77% and 83%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of LBC with ME-NBI for IM were comparably high at 79%, 97% and 89%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upon immunohistochemistry, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 19 metaplastic epithelia of LBC-positive BE showed immunoreactivity against anti-MUC2 antibody, whereas CD10 antigen was identified in 11 of the 19 LBC-positive BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brush borders were seen on IM epithelia using electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On real-time PCR analysis, CD10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the LBC-positive BE were higher compared to those in the LBC-negative BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The appearance of LBC can be an accurate sign to predict SIM in BE and may be associated with high CD10 expression, possibly along with brush borders </plain></SENT>
