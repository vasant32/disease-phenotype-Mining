<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Periodic endoscopic surveillance is generally recommended for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The optimal follow-up strategy for uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is controversial, in part because of limited data on the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> (through the sequence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) during endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to quantify the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and to explore clinical risk factors associated with the development of dysplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 102 patients with endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and the presence of specialized columnar epithelium who had received endoscopic surveillance for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at our medical center between 1970 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We abstracted endoscopic and histologic data from the medical record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> specimens that showed any degree of atypia (per report) were reexamined in blinded fashion by a team of study pathologists who indicated the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time to first diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was plotted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and risk factors for development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were assessed using Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 563 patient-yr of endoscopic follow-up, three patients developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at least 4 yr after initial diagnosis (one developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the cardia, which was incidentally detected during surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At some point during follow-up, 19 patients developed new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and four developed high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients who had received antireflux surgery developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: If confirmed by larger follow-up studies, our results suggest that surveillance endoscopy can be safely deferred for at least 2 yr following an initial biopsy that is negative or indeterminate for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adoption of this approach would substantially reduce the cost of surveillance for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future trials should explore the role of antireflux surgery in protecting against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
