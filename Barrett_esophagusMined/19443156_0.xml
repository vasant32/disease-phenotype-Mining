<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In both 2002 and 2005, anonymous postal surveys were sent out, involving eight criteria pertaining to three main areas to assess compliance, to 245 hepatogastroenterologists based in private and public hospitals, and in the community, in a specific region of France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The multifaceted intervention was based on reminders, conferences, postal campaigns and esophageal mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were based on biopsies for diagnosis, surveillance intervals and management of patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 2002 and 2005, survey response rates were 81.6 and 73.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In terms of diagnosis, compliance with the systematic performance of biopsies increased from 26.5 to 59.9% (p&lt;0.01) and, with follow-up, from 41.0 to 52.0%, respectively (p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Management of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> increased from 16.0 to 24.3% (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total compliance (with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> criteria) was achieved by 5.0% of hepatogastroenterologists in 2002 and by 10.7% in 2005 (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that a multifaceted interventional program can dramatically improve physician compliance with the guidelines for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we recommend that national scientific societies disseminate their guidelines through targeted activity to ensure that they are followed by hepatogastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
