<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Samples from a total of 136 individuals were examined, including 7 characterized as BE, 12 as HGD, 56 as EAC, and 61 as NC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In typical data sets, it was possible to assign âˆ¼20 to 30 glycan ions based on MS measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ion mobility distributions for these ions show multiple features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some cases, such as the [S1H5N4+3Na]3+ and [S1F1H5N4+3Na]3+ glycan ions, the ratio of intensities of high-mobility features to low-mobility features vary significantly for different groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree to which such variations in mobility profiles can be used to distinguish phenotypes is evaluated for 11 N-linked glycan ions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An outlier analysis on each sample class followed by an unsupervised <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> using a genetic algorithm for pattern recognition reveals that EAC samples are separated from NC samples based on 46 features originating from the 11-glycan composite IMS distribution </plain></SENT>
