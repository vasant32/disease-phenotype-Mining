<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>GOALS: To investigate the relationship between fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and its <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: FASN, a key enzyme of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, is overexpressed not only in various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, but also in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant conditions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, FASN overexpression is considered to be indicative of a possible premalignant stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY: Patients (N=354) with endoscopically and histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mucin phenotyping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, expression of FASN and COX-2, cellular proliferation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were evaluated immunohistochemically in biopsy samples, and factors influencing FASN expression were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To evaluate if gastric reflux induces FASN expression, esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> and low pH, and the effect of a FASN inhibitor on cell proliferation was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of FASN protein was observed in 52.2% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> by immunohistochemistry; this expression pattern was retained in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intestinal mucin phenotype, COX-2, increased stromal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and elevated proliferating cell nuclear antigen index were confirmed to be positive independent factors for FASN expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line SEG-1, FASN <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> with low pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was strongly suppressed by the FASN inhibitor C75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FASN is strongly expressed in the intestinal mucin phenotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, in which Barrett's glandular cells display elevated cellular proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, and COX-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Exposure of the lower esophagus to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> with low pH may induce FASN in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
