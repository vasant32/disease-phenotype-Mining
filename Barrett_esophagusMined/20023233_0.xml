<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It consists of a process of replacement of the squamous epithelium of the esophagus by intestinal columnar epithelium containing goblet cells, known as specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with goblet cells, and several factors have been related to its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate an experimental model of duodenogastroesophageal reflux and the effect of ingestion of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> solution on the genesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty were not submitted to surgery and served as controls (10 animals ingesting only water and 10 ingesting water plus a solution of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>), while the remaining 40 animals were submitted to side-to-side duodenogastroesophageal anastomosis (20 animals ingesting only water and 20 ingesting water plus the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> solution) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Vienna classification for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was used in the analysis of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 42 weeks of observation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was found in 26.3% (5/19) of the animals submitted to surgery that had not ingested <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrites</z:chebi> compared to 72.3% (13/18) of the animals in the group submitted to surgery and given <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrites</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (33.3%) were also found in this latter group </plain></SENT>
