<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare pH profiles at sites within the LES, the distal esophagus, and the proximal stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects underwent esophageal manometry followed by 24-hour esophagogastric pH monitoring using an 8-channel pH probe recording at 5 and 1.5 cm above and at 0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, and 9.5 cm below the proximal LES border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During pH recording, a 4-hour gastric emptying test with an egg sandwich meal was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The LES was 3.2 +/- 0.4 cm in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a progressive increase in acid exposure from the esophageal to the gastric pH sensors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>pH was less than 4 for 3.4% +/- 1.6%, 12.7% +/- 8.5%, 26.5% +/- 10.2%, 48.1% +/- 11.3%, 66.5% +/- 9.9%, 80.8% +/- 5.6%, 89.2% +/- 3.0%, and 96.7% +/- 1.1% of the total time for pH probes at 5 and 1.5 cm above and 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6.0, and 9.5 cm below the proximal LES border, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Percentage acid exposures correlated significantly with the position of the probe (r = -0.95; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intrasphincteric acidity increased postprandially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gastric emptying was correlated inversely with the intragastric hydrogen ion concentration (r = -0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of recording time that pH was less than 4 was significantly higher in the intrasphincteric area and 1.5 cm above the proximal LES compared with the traditional site 5 cm above the proximal manometric LES border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High acid exposure in the intrasphincteric region might explain the susceptibility of the distal esophagus to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>, strictures, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
