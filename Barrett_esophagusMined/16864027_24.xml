<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mucosal ablation and endoscopic mucosal resection have been proposed as alternatives to surgical resection as therapy for intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (IMC) of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acceptance of these alternative therapies requires an understanding of the clinical biology of IMC and the results of surgical resection modified for treatment of early disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of 78 patients (65 men, 13 women; median age 66 years) with IMC who were treated with progressively less-extensive surgical resections (ie, en bloc, transhiatal, and vagal-sparing esophagectomy) from 1987 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was located in a visible segment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 65 (83%) and in cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in 13 (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A visible lesion was present in 53 (68%) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 4 the lesion was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those patients with visible Barrett's, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was within 3 cm of the gastroesophageal junction in 66% and within 1 cm in 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy was en bloc in 23, transhiatal in 31, vagal-sparing in 20, and transthoracic in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was 2.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vagal-sparing esophagectomy had less morbidity, a shorter hospital stay, and no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who had en bloc resection, a median of 41 nodes were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had one lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining and two others, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining, had micrometastases on immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at 5 years was 88% and was similar for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients died from systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and seven from noncancer causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IMC occurred in cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of patients with IMC had a visible lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> occurred near the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were uncommon, questioning the need for lymphadenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A vagal-sparing technique had less morbidity than other forms of resection and no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Survival after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of resection was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Outcomes of endoscopic techniques should be compared with this benchmark </plain></SENT>
