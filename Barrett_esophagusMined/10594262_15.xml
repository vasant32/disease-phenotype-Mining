<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that endoscopic grading of the gastroesophageal flap valve is a good predictor of the reflux status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To test this hypothesis, 268 symptomatic patients underwent endoscopic grading of the gastroesophageal valve using Hill's classification, with grades I through IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Esophageal acid exposure, lower esophageal sphincter characteristics, and the degree of esophageal mucosal injury were compared among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of a mechanically defective sphincter, abnormal esophageal acid exposure, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> increased with increasing alteration of the gastroesophageal valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of a grade IV valve indicated increased esophageal acid exposure in 75% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a predictor, this is similar to lower esophageal sphincter pressure but not as good as the presence of esophageal mucosal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic grading of the gastroesophageal valve provides useful information about the reflux status but is less useful as an indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) than the presence of esophageal mucosal injury </plain></SENT>
