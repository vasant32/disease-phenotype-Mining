<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Using clinical practice guidelines, a registered nurse adjusted antireflux medications, evaluated esophageal biopsy reports, determined the interval between surveillance endoscopies, and provided education for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No previous reports have assessed the effectiveness or patient satisfaction associated with registered nurse-provided primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because estimates of the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> vary widely, we also prospectively followed a cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Charts were reviewed to determine the frequency of variation from guidelines, the annual incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and frequency of reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were mailed a questionnaire to assess satisfaction with their medical care and with the nurse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Variation by the nurse from the guidelines on surveillance endoscopy (1.9%) and the treatment of reflux (1.3%) was rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients were very satisfied (score of 6 on 0-6-point Likert scale) with overall medical care (88%), and patient education (76%), and most patients did not think that increased physician involvement would improve their care (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven percent of patients had control of reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients with long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 67) developed high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> over 323 patient-yr of follow-up (1 of 162 patient-yr for an annual incidence of 0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients with short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 56) developed high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> over 172 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The registered nurse in our clinical setting effectively administered clinical practice guidelines for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without clinically significant morbidity or patient dissatisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Before these results can be generalized to other settings, further studies will need to be performed </plain></SENT>
