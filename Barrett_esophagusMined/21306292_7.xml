<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current standard of care involves esophagectomy, a procedure associated with a high morbidity, a negative impact on long term quality of life, and a mortality rate of 1-6 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An entirely endoscopic technique for circumferential, long segment en bloc removal of the mucosa and submucosa with subsequent placement of a biologic scaffold material that promotes a constructive remodeling response and minimizes stricture is described herein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of this approach are reported for five patients with 4-24-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Restoration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mature, K4+/K14+, squamous epithelium, and return to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet without significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> is reported for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of five patients show a small focus of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at the gastroesophageal junction, but the entire length and circumference of the reconstituted esophageal mucosa remains free of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This experience provides evidence that a regenerative medicine approach may, for the first time, enable aggressive endoscopic resection of early stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> without the need for esophagectomy and its associated complications </plain></SENT>
