<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the usefulness of p53 immunostaining in identifying the subgroup of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> who may be at increased risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue samples of 41 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and available sequential histologic data were processed for p53 immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results from each patient were compared over time, and the results of a subset of patients were compared with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a significant correlation between the percentage of samples with p53 expression and the severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in a subset of patients with mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (cases classified as showing indefinite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>), we observed a statistically significant difference in the percentage of p53-positive samples between the group that progressed to more severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and the group that did not progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that this procedure, which is technically simple, economical, and quick, could play a role in the evaluation and follow-up of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
