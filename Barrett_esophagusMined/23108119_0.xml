<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that blockade of the Hh pathway with smoothened (Smo) inhibitor can prevent the development of BE/EAC in the Levrat model, in which induced gastroduodenoesophageal reflux (GDER) leads to esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : GDER was induced in 6- to 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Smo inhibitor (10 mg/kg/d) was given orally on postoperative weeks 10 to 16, 18 to 22, and 24 to 28, and rats were killed on week 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the incidence of BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To examine potential therapeutic effects of Smo inhibition on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue, semiquantitative immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 and caspase 3 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In treated animals that developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, gene expression was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : Thirty-eight of 48 controls and 32 of 46 treated animals survived to 28 weeks. messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) expression of Indian Hh, a ligand of transmembrane receptor patched 1, was 184× higher in BE and 99× higher in EAC compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal tissue (P = 0.0239 and P = 0.0004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, the incidence of BE and EAC was decreased in treated animals by 35.7% (relative risk reduction, 36%; P = 0.0015) and 36% (relative risk reduction, 62%; P = 0.0033), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with untreated EAC, Ki-67 was downregulated (P = 0.04) and cleaved caspase 3 was no different in treated EAC (P = 0.398) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 84 well-known genes involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> drug resistance, 50 were dysregulated in treated EAC (P &lt; 0.05 for each gene) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : Smo inhibitor prevents the development of BE and EAC in an in vivo model of GDER </plain></SENT>
