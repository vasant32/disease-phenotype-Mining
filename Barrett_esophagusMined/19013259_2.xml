<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Utilizing data obtained during a multicenter investigation, this paper illustrates how the use of covariates and careful modeling techniques can be useful in assessing whether a negative outcome from a small multicenter clinical trial could be due to imbalance in baseline characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Chemoprevention for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> Trial (CBET) was a phase IIb, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcomes for the original study were the proportion of biopsy samples exhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and placebo groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The secondary and tertiary outcomes included histologic change and measurements of biologically relevant markers, including COX-1 and -2 mRNA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoid</z:chebi> levels, and methylation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes p16, APC, and E-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The original study reported no significant differences in primary, secondary or tertiary outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we focus on the results of one of the secondary measures, quantitative endoscopy (QE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The study utilizes data from 56 patients in the CBET for whom baseline (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) QE and one-year follow-up QE (F04) studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 29 were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> (200 mg twice daily for a minimum of 48 weeks) and 27 received the placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These patients are segmented as to the presence or absence of circumferential, tongues or islands of Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The response of interest is total affected area at one year (Total F04); affected area at baseline (Total <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is used as a covariate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Controlling for complexity and clinic, there is a significant treatment effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is significant evidence that the area of Barrett's involvement decreased for patients in the treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: That there was a decrease for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> over the placebo group adds to the body of evidence that relates COX-2 specific inhibitors and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
