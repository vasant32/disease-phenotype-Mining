<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most current endoscopic guidelines do not recommend the use of routine esophagoscopy in the evaluation of patients with typical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), unless alarm features are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with known reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, esophagoscopy is considered to have no role either in the further management or follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Screening of reflux patients for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is not considered to be cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of a critical review of the available literature, and of some recent papers in particular, we disagree with these suggestions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We would argue, on the contrary, that a negative esophagoscopy can provide the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patient with reassurance, and that esophagoscopy allows targeted therapy to be offered if it is positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is diagnosed, it usually leads to a surveillance program being initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The potential benefits of endoscopy for the patient's quality of life are probably underestimated when financial issues alone are taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even if it is true that a large percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients do not have endoscopic abnormalities (those with nonerosive reflux disease), surrogate tests such as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitor</z:chebi> test or symptom questionnaires do not provide a more accurate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We would therefore suggest that, at least in the specialist setting, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> should undergo accurate symptom analysis as well as endoscopic evaluation before treatment is started </plain></SENT>
