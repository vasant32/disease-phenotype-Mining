<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of EGF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophageal disease</z:e>, its quantity and distribution in the oesophageal mucosa of control subjects and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophageal disease</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oesophageal biopsy specimens, taken 20-40 cm from the incisors in 72 patients, were graded histologically and adjacent specimens were taken for immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of EGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e>, specimens were also taken from the gastric cardia for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty two biopsy specimens showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, 20 Barrett's mucosa, and 30 were histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGF was found in the capillary endothelium of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal papillae and basal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly more EGF positive papillae were found in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (81%) than in the inflamed mucosa (42%) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 20 patients with Barrett's mucosa showed abnormal expression of EGF in 25% of the isthmus and superficial epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study has shown that EGF is found only in the endothelial cells of the capillaries of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal mucosa and that the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is detectable significantly less frequently than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the inflamed oesophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EGF is also abnormally present, in large quantities, in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells of Barrett's mucosa compared with gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
