<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular markers are urgently needed to identify Barrett's patients at the highest risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this end, we have used a rapid molecular technique, restriction site mutation (RSM), to detect low-frequency mutations in the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor gene in premalignant Barrett's tissues of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 38 endoscopically diagnosed Barrett's patients with a range of histological stages of Barrett's progression, plus four control patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, were analysed for early p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples taken from these patients (93 samples in total) were analysed for the presence of low-frequency p53 mutations at hotspot codons: 175, 213, 248, 249, 282 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total, 13 of the 38 Barrett's patients were shown to possess a p53 mutation in at least one sample (no mutations in the four control patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although no statistically significant associations were found, p53 mutations reflected histological progression in Barrett's patients with p53 mutations found in 30% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> patients (P=0.4) and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> patients (P=0.33) and 45% of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> patients (P=0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detected p53 mutations were mainly GC to AT transitions at CpG sites </plain></SENT>
