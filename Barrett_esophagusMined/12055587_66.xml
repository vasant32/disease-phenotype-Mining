<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the best-known target of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>, and expression of the COX-2 isoform is elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> but its clinical significance remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined COX-2 expression in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and its relation to clinicopathologic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> sections from 145 consecutive patients undergoing intentionally curative surgery for an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were immunohistochemically stained using a COX-2-specific anti-human monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specimens were scored based on the intensity and extent of COX-2 immunopositivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: COX-2 immunoreactivity was negative to weak in 21% (COX-2 low) and moderate to strong in 79% (COX-2 high) of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with high COX-2 expression were more likely to develop distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (P = 0.02) and local recurrences (P = 0.05), and survival was significantly reduced (P = 0.002, log-rank test) among patients with high COX-2 expression when compared with the COX-2 low group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival rates were 35% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23-47) and 72% (95% CI, 53-90) in COX-2 high and COX-2 low categories, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, expression of COX-2 was recognized as an independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis (relative risk, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.6-7.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated expression of COX-2 protein is associated with significantly reduced survival of patients undergoing surgery for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings support the effort to initiate clinical studies to investigate the effect of COX-2 inhibitors as a novel (adjuvant) chemotherapeutic modality for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
