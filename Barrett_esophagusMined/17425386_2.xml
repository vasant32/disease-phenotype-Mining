<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we have seen cases diagnosed as Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> based solely on cells that pose morphologic similarity to ITGCs on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining or stain positive with Alcian blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical significance of goblet cell mimickers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Initial biopsies from 78 patients with original diagnosis of Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and a mean follow-up of 72 months were reviewed and reclassified into 3 categories: (1) ITGCs, (2) goblet cell mimickers, or (3) neither </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sections from available paraffin blocks were stained with Alcian blue at pH 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of the different types of cells and positive Alcian blue staining were correlated with each other and evaluated for their significance as predictors of progression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Goblet cell mimickers were present in 35 cases and were associated with ITGCs in the same biopsy in 23 (66%) of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intestinal-type goblet cells were present in 56 cases, and the remaining 10 cases, although called Barrett on the original report, did not show either ITGCs or goblet cell mimickers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only the presence of ITGCs was associated with significant risk for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Positive Alcian blue staining was not associated with a significant risk for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the diagnosis of Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> should be rendered with confidence only when ITGCs are identified on routine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin-stained sections </plain></SENT>
