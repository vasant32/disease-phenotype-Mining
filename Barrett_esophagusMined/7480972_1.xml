<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate on the presence and significance of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) in Barrett's mucosa, esophageal biopsy specimens from 34 patients with columnar-lined epithelium were retrospectively examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of colonization was compared with that observed in a control group of 76 subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of the 34 Barrett's specimens were Hp-positive and only 1 of these showed evidence of inflamed mucosa (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We do not find in this study any evidence to support the existence of association between Hp and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of Hp in antral mucosa of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positive cases suggest the possibility that esophageal colonisation might merely be a consequence of reflux from the gastric antrum </plain></SENT>
