<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: To determine the attitudes of French hepatogastroenterologists to screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, a postal anonymous questionnaire survey was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was sent to 246 hepatogastroenterologists in the Rhone-Alpes area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We defined eight criteria allowed to assess the conformity of practices with the guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We created three topics composed of several criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The topics analysed were 'Biopsies', 'Surveillance' and the diagnosis of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We studied the factors which could be associated with the compliance with the guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate was 81.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For 58.0% of the gastroenterologists, endoscopic biopsy sampling were made according to French guidelines (four-quadrant biopsies at 2 cm intervals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Agreement was 78.0% regarding the interval of surveillance for no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (every 2 or 3 years) and 78.5% regarding the low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (every 6 or 12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the management of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 28.6% actually confirm the diagnosis by a second anatomopathologist and 42.0% treated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> during 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concerning the biopsies, the young gastroenterologists and gastroenterologists practising in university hospitals had a better adherence to the guidelines (Relative Risk: 2.22, 95% CI 1.25-3.95 and 3.74, 95% CI 1.04-13.47, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The other factors of risk were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic follow-up is mostly realized in accordance with the national guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, there is a wide variability in individual current practice </plain></SENT>
