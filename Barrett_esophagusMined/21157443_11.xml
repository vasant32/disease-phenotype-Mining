<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is currently fraught with difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current gold standard method of assessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk is histological assessment, with the appearance of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) as the key event monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sampling error during endoscopy limits the usefulness of this approach, and there has been much recent interest in supplementing histological assessment with molecular markers, which may aid in patient stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: No molecular marker has been yet validated to accurately correlate with esophageal histological progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we assessed the suitability of several membranous proteins as biomarkers by correlating their abundance with histological progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 107 patient samples, from 100 patients, were arranged on a tissue microarray (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>) and represented the various stages of histological progression in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> was probed with antibodies for eight receptor proteins (mostly membranous) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) staining was found to be the most promising biomarker identified with clear increases in staining accompanying histological progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, immunohistochemistry was performed using the full-tissue sections from BE, HGD, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissues, which confirmed the stepwise increase in EGFR abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using a robust H-score analysis, EGFR abundance was shown to increase 13-fold in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissues compared to the BE tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EGFR was "overexpressed" in 35% of HGD specimens and 80% of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> specimens when using the H-score of the BE patients (plus 3 s.d.) as the threshold to define overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EGFR staining was also noted to be higher in BE tissues adjacent to HGD/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Western blotting, although showing more EGFR protein in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> compared to the BE tissue, was highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>EGFR overexpression was accompanied by <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (gain) of chromosome 7, plus amplification of the EGFR locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (DCA) (at neutral and acidic pH) and acid alone was capable of upregulating EGFR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in vitro, and in the case of neutral pH DCA, this was NF-ÎºB dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EGFR is overexpressed during the histological progression in BE tissues and hence may be useful as a biomarker of histological progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as EGFR is a membranous protein expressed on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface of the esophageal mucosa, it may also be a useful target for biopsy guidance during endoscopy </plain></SENT>
