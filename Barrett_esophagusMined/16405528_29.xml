<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is the precursor of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (ACA), most patients with ACA present outside of a BE surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This could be due to undiagnosed symptomatic GER and BE or BE/ACA occurring in patients without reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have, therefore, studied the prevalence of BE and symptom status in older patients referred for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients referred for outpatient colonoscopy were eligible if they were at least 65 yr old and had not previously undergone esophagoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After informed consent, the patients completed detailed GER questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the research endoscopy, the endoscopist recorded the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) as either long-segment BE (LSBE), short-segment BE (SSBE), or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the SCJ was felt to be "irregular" the endoscopist was asked to predict, in their judgment, if BE was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had biopsies below the SCJ, which were examined by a gastrointestinal pathologist who was blinded to the endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE esophagus was present in 50 of the 300 patients studied (16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BE was more common in men (35 of 161, 21.7%) than in women (15 of 139, 10.8%) (p &lt; 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms were reported in 106 patients (35%) and BE was present in 19.8% of symptomatic and 14.9% of asymptomatic cases (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The majority of the BE in this study was less than 3 cm in length (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The questionnaires did not predict the presence of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BE is common in unscreened male and female patients at least 65 yr of age who are referred for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Men were more likely than women to have BE although it occurred in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Reflux symptoms were fairly common but a poor predictor of BE </plain></SENT>
