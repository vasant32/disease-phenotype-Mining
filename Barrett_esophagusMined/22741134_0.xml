<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical applications of cryotherpy such as in pulmonology have increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until now, its development in gastroenterology has been insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But, as clinical application such as mucosal ablation on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> became possible, various applications have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to make standards of tissue injury's extent in cryotherapy prior to clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the tissue injury according to the application of cryoprobe with a pig model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cryoprobe was applied to several different segments of the esophagus and stomach for various lengths of time using various number of probe's contact in a pig model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 48 hours, esophagus and stomach were harvested and histological tissue injury was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extent of tissue injury was decided by the injury of the deepest layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopic application of cryoprobe on esophagus and stomach resulted in a dose-dependent injury: esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was limited to the submucosa after 10 seconds of cryotherapy, and extended to involve the transmural <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> after over 15 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>Necrosis</z:mp> on stomach was extended to involve the transmural <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> after over 20 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Positive relationship was seen between the duration and frequency of cryoprobe application and the extent of tissue injury </plain></SENT>
