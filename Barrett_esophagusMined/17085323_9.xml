<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence suggests that COX-2-derived <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2)) plays an important role in esophageal adenocarcinogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) receptors (EP) have been shown to be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since it is not known which receptors regulate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) signals in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, we investigated the role of EP receptors using a human Barrett's-derived esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line (OE33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OE33 cells expressed COX-1, COX-2, EP(1), EP(2) and EP(4) but not EP(3) receptors as determined by real time RT-PCR and Western-blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 5-aza-dC restored expression, suggesting that hypermethylation is involved in EP(3) downregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) production was mainly due to COX-2, since this was significantly suppressed with COX-2 inhibitors (NS-398 and SC-58125), but not COX-1 inhibitors (SC-560) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation ((3)H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> uptake) was significantly inhibited by NS-398 and SC-58125, the EP(1) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SC-51322, AH6809 (EP(1)/EP(2) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>), and the EP(4) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> AH23848B, but was not affected by exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with the selective EP(2) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> Butaprost or 16,16-dimethylPGE(2) significantly inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and stimulated OE33 cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) on migration was attenuated when cells were first treated with EP(1) and EP(4) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a potential role for EP selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> in the treatment of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
