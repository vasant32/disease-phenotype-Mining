<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, we used high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to profile chromosomal aberrations at each of the four sequential progression stages, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and EAC, in 101 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant trend toward increasing loss of chromosomes with higher progression stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For BM, LGD, HGD, and EAC, respectively, the average numbers of chromosome arms with loss per sample were 0.30, 3.21, 7.70, and 11.90 (P for trend = 4.82 x 10(-7)), and the mean percentages of single nucleotide polymorphisms with allele loss were 0.1%, 1.8%, 6.6%, and 17.2% (P for trend = 2.64 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In LGD, loss of 3p14.2 (68.4%) and 16q23.1 (47.4%) was limited to narrow regions within the FHIT (3p14.2) and WWOX (16q23.1) genes, whereas loss of 9p21 (68.4%) occurred in larger regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the loss of other chromosomal regions was seen in HGD and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loss of 17p (47.6%) was one of the most frequent events in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many recurrent small regions of chromosomal loss disrupted single genes, including FHIT, WWOX, RUNX1, KIF26B, MGC48628, PDE4D, C20orf133, GMDS, DMD, and PARK2, most of which are common fragile site regions in the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, RUNX1 at 21q22 seemed to be a potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Amplifications were less frequent than losses and mostly occurred in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>8q24 (containing Myc) and 8p23.1 (containing CTSB) were the two most frequently amplified regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significant trend toward increasing amplification was associated with higher progression stage </plain></SENT>
