<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Some physicians believe that an aggressive surgical approach for the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0152018" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the esophagus</z:e> and cardia is unwise in elderly patients because of allegedly higher rates of mortality and morbidity and lower rates of survival than those associated with younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have long advocated an aggressive surgical approach regardless of the patient's age and have reviewed our experience to determine whether age was a factor influencing treatment and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: From January 1, 1970 to January 1, 1997, 505 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0152018" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the esophagus</z:e> or cardia underwent operations by one surgical team using standard surgical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-seven patients (29.1%) were 70 years of age or older and 358 patients (70.9%) were under 70 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their records and clinicopathologic features were reviewed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The two groups were similar regarding the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cell types were similar except for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, which were less common in the older group (15.6% versus 24%; p=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical procedures were similar, as were the rates of resectability and the percentages of R0 resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hospital mortality rate was higher in the elderly patients but not significantly so, and the rates of major and minor complications combined were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The differences in postresection pathologic staging were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory palliation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was comparable between the groups, as were actuarial 5-year survival rates (24.1% of the elderly patients versus 22.4% of the younger patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Age should not be a limiting factor in using an aggressive surgical approach for the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0152018" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the esophagus</z:e> or cardia in patients aged 70 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such an approach can be performed as safely as in younger patients, with comparable rates of palliation and survival </plain></SENT>
