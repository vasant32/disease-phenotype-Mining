<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic endoluminal radiofrequency ablation using the Barrx device is a new technique to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This procedure has been used in patients who have not had antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report is presents an early experience of the effects of endoluminal ablation on the reflux symptoms and completeness of ablation in post-fundoplication patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients who have had either a laparoscopic or open Nissen fundoplication and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent endoscopic endoluminal ablation of the Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> using the Barrx device (Barrx Medical, Sunnyvale, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preprocedure, none of the patients had significant symptoms related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One to two weeks after the ablation, patients were questioned as to the presence of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preprocedure and postprocedure, they completed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-HRQL symptom severity questionnaire (best possible score, 0; worst possible score, 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients had follow-up endoscopy to assess completeness of ablation 3 months after the original treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients completed the ablation without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients reported recurrence of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median preprocedure total <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-HRQL score was 2, compared to a median postprocedure score of 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient had residual Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> at 3 months follow-up, requiring re-ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report of a small number of patients demonstrates that endoscopic endoluminal ablation of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> using the Barrx device is safe and effective in patients who have already undergone antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There appears to be no disruption in the fundoplication or recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-related symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, longer-term follow-up with more patients is needed </plain></SENT>
