<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An imbalance between phase I drug metabolism [e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi>)] and phase II detoxification [e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase (GST)] may contribute to the development of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphic variants in the CYP1A1 gene were described leading to increased levels of bioactive compounds, whereas polymorphisms in GST genes often resulted in impaired detoxification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the frequencies of polymorphic variants in CYP1A1, GSTP1, GSTT1, and GSTM1 genes in 98 patients with Barrett's epithelium and 34 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those obtained from 247 healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted, and PCR-RFLP methods were used to detect genetic polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chi2 analysis, Spearman rank correlation, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for statistical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in CYP1A1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 occurred at an equal frequency in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of the polymorphic GSTP1b variant in the GSTP1 gene resulted in a significantly lower GST enzyme activity (P &lt; 0.05), and GSTP1b was found significantly more often in patients with Barrett's epithelium (70%; P &lt; 0.001) and patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (76%; P = 0.005), as compared to healthy blood donors (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, presence of the GSTP1b allele leads to lower GST enzyme activity levels and, consequently, impaired detoxification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This most important esophageal GST isoform may, therefore, contribute to the development of Barrett's epithelium and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
