<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We prospectively evaluated gastric acid output (mEq/h), gastric volume output (ml/h), ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring, and the endoscopic appearance of the esophagus in 23 patients undergoing treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> long-standing pyrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve of these 23 individuals (52%) remained symptomatic after 3 mo of standard antisecretory treatment with <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi>, 150 mg twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When compared with initial responders, those patients who did not experience complete symptomatic relief on therapy had significantly higher basal acid output (p less than 0.001), basal volume output (p less than 0.02), and basal upright (but not supine) reflux time (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 12 patients who did not respond to initial treatment had gastric acid hypersecretion (basal acid output greater than 10 mEq/h), and 10 of the 12 had Barrett's epithelium compared with only 1 patient in the initial-responder group (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 nonresponders were treated for an additional 3 mo with increased doses of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> (mean, 1280 mg/day; range, 600-1800 mg/day), and complete disappearance of pyrosis occurred in 10 of the 12, although no significant endoscopic regression was observed in the extent of the underlying columnar mucosa in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> over the 6-mo duration of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was shown between the daily <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> dose required to eliminate symptoms and the pretreatment basal acid output (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001); gastric acid output had to be almost totally suppressed (i.e., less than 1 mEq/h) for pyrosis to disappear completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No side effects occurred with any of these high doses of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a subgroup of patients with long-standing symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> who do not respond to standard <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>-healing doses of histamine2-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> are hypersecretors of basal gastric acid and require increased acid-suppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many of these individuals also have underlying Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
