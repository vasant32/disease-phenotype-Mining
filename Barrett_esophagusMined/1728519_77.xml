<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is established when the esophageal mucosa is lined by 2-3 cm of columnar epithelium or when specialized (intestinal type) columnar epithelium of any length is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emphasis is frequently placed on long segments of Barrett's because these patients reportedly are at higher risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> than patients with shorter segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present four cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> that arose in tongues or short segments (less than 2 cm) of specialized columnar epithelium near the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We emphasize the need for biopsy of minimal appearing abnormalities in this area, and we suggest that histologic subtype, rather than length of involvement, be the major criterion for establishment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
