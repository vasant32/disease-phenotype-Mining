<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Data from previous studies on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the gastroesophageal junction have been conflicting, which makes the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> less obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may partly be due to the lack of a reliable classification of the Z-line appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously proposed such a classification (the ZAP classification) that was shown to correlate with the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of different immunohistochemical techniques has increased in the study of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study our aim was to 1) evaluate the impact of different antibodies, namely cytokeratin (CK) 7, 13, and 20, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3311">CaCO3</z:chebi>/73, and FBB2/29, in order to differentiate between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and 2) explore the staining patterns in different ZAP grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-nine specimens with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were compared--9 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 6 from cardia, and 24 from the Z-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Z-line specimens were evaluated with respect to ZAP grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences were encountered regarding staining patterns for CK13 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3311">CaCO3</z:chebi>/73 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The staining pattern of CK7/20 was significantly different between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CK7/20 showed a rising frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> staining pattern with rising ZAP grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CK7/20 is a feasible marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in different ZAP grades differs regarding expression of immunohistochemical markers </plain></SENT>
