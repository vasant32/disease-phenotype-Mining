<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with small early Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> APC might offer an effective, minimally invasive alternative to mucosectomy or photodynamic therapy, as the treatment procedure is less cumbersome and the equipment less expensive </plain></SENT>
