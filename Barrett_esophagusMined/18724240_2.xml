<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a rare case of esophageal polypoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with gastric phenotype and focal intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 69-year-old man with a long history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> was initially seen at an outside institution for evaluation of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Screening upper gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluation revealed a large intraluminal polypoid lesion occluding the distal portion of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgery was performed with resection of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histopathologic examination of this lesion revealed an exuberant polypoid gastric epithelium with areas of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and focal intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A few residual foci of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were identified at the proximal and distal ends of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, this lesion revealed a pattern of expression of apomucins (MUC5AC diffusely positive, MUC1 and MUC6 focally positive, and MUC2 negative) consistent with a gastric foveolar phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, in the dysplastic areas, there was high Ki-67 labeling index and no overexpression of p53 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, this case represents a precursor lesion of an extremely well-differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of gastric foveolar phenotype that has been previously documented in the stomach and in the duodenum and that now for the first time we report in the esophagus in association with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
