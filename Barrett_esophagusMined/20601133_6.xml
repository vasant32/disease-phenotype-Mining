<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the role of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy in identifying Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> examined at a tertiary referral center, between July 2005 and November 2008 using Fujinon gastroscopes and EPX 4400 processor (n = 190) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were performed by a single experienced endoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined with white light gastroscopy and visible abnormalities were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">Acetic acid</z:chebi> (2.5%) dye spray was used to identify potentially neoplastic areas and biopsy samples were collected from these, followed by quadrantic biopsies at 2 cm intervals of the remaining Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chromoendoscopic diagnosis was compared with the ultimate histological diagnosis to evaluate the sensitivity of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">Acetic acid</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy had a sensitivity of 95.5% and specificity of 80% for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between lesions predicted to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> by <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> and those diagnosed by histological analysis (r = 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant improvement in the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> using <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> compared with white light endoscopy (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of this large series showed that <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>-assisted evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> detects <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> better than white light endoscopy, with sensitivity and specificity equal to that of histological analysis </plain></SENT>
