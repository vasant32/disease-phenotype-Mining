<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to identify chromosomal loci involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of Barrett's epithelium and the development of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, microsatellite analysis was carried out on 17 cases of Barrett's-associated oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples of premalignant Barrett's epithelium adjacent to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were obtained from seven of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allelic imbalance was detected in &gt; 45% of informative cases of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> on chromosome arms 3q (65%), 4q (71%), 5q (59%), 6q (59%), 9p (50%), 9q (47%), 12p (47%), 12q (65%), 17p (76%), and 18q (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allelic imbalance at 4q, 17p, and 18q was significantly higher than the upper 95% confidence interval for background allelic imbalance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allelic imbalance was detected at several loci in the premalignant epithelium from five of the seven cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These loci included several chromosomal arms that had demonstrated high levels of allelic imbalance in oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, namely, 4q (one case), 5q (two cases), 9 (three cases), 12q (five cases), 17p (four cases), and 18q (two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Novel microsatellite alleles were detected in both premalignant and malignant Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three cases, dysplastic Barrett's epithelium and adjacent <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> demonstrated the same pattern of novel microsatellite alleles at a number of loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these data indicate chromosomal loci which may be specifically involved in the histological progression of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The detection of shared novel microsatellite alleles in premalignant and malignant Barrett's epithelium is consistent with a process of clonal expansion underlying this progression </plain></SENT>
