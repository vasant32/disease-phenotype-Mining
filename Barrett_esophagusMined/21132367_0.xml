<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The sensitivity of screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and <z:mp ids='MP_0000467'>esophageal dysplasia</z:mp> (ED) is hampered by the limited amount of tissue that can be sampled by forceps biopsy (FB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate computer assisted analysis of an abrasive, transepithelial brush biopsy as an adjunct to FB to increase detection of BE and ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a multicenter prospective trial of patients being screened for BE and ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient had two brush biopsies (BB) and then random four-quadrant FB every 1-2 cm of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BB were examined with computer assistance by pathologists at CDx Laboratories (Suffern, NY), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FB were examined by the investigators' local pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,266 patients enrolled, 363 were diagnosed with BE by FB alone and 146 additional cases of BE were identified by adding BB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of BB to FB increased the overall detection of BE by 39.8% (95% CI 32-48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This added detection of BE in 11.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients tested with the BB (146/1266) resulted in a number of patients needed to test (NNT) to obtain each additional positive finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of 8.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among a subset of 848 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and no prior history of BE, the addition of BB to FB identified an additional 105 patients with BE increasing the overall detection of BE by 70.5% (95% CI 54-90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was diagnosed in 16 patients by FB alone, with an additional 14 cases detected by adding BB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The addition of BB to FB thus increased the detection of ED by 87.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that adjunctive computer-assisted analysis of an abrasive brush biopsy has the potential to substantially improve the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in screening populations </plain></SENT>
