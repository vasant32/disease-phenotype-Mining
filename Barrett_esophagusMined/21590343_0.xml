<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is characterized by a distinct Th-2-predominant cytokine profile, unlike the pro-inflammatory nature of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the role of Th-2 cytokines during the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, using a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was induced by Levrat's esophagojejunostomy technique in Brown-Norway (BN) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed at 8, 15, 30, and 50 weeks after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of cytokines and CDX2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we compared the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in BN rats with that in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>Esophagitis</z:hpo> was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> appeared 8 weeks after the operation, and its incidence and length increased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of Th-2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and IL-13 were significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> as compared to those in non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, while there were no differences in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The peak of elevated IL-4 mRNA was observed before that of CDX2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IL-4 was co-localized in CD4-positive cells and CDX2-positive goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was more common in BN rats (8/10, 80%) than in SD rats (2/7, 28%) at 30 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Th-2 cytokines, especially IL-4, may play a crucial role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in an early phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results provide understanding of the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> from the aspect of the Th-2 immune response </plain></SENT>
