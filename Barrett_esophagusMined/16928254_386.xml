<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A globally acceptable definition and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is desirable for research and clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this initiative was to develop a consensus definition and classification that would be useful for patients, physicians, and regulatory agencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A modified Delphi process was employed to reach consensus using repeated iterative voting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A series of statements was developed by a working group of five experts after a systematic review of the literature in three databases (Embase, Cochrane trials register, Medline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over a period of 2 yr, the statements were developed, modified, and approved through four rounds of voting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The voting group consisted of 44 experts from 18 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final vote was conducted on a 6-point scale and consensus was defined a priori as agreement by two-thirds of the participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The level of agreement strengthened throughout the process with two-thirds of the participants agreeing with 86%, 88%, 94%, and 100% of statements at each vote, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the final vote, 94% of the final 51 statements were approved by 90% of the Consensus Group, and 90% of statements were accepted with strong agreement or minor reservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> was defined as a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The disease was subclassified into esophageal and extraesophageal syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Novel aspects of the new definition include a patient-centered approach that is independent of endoscopic findings, subclassification of the disease into discrete syndromes, and the recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023067" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngitis</z:e>, cough, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, and dental <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> as possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It also proposes a new definition for suspected and proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based global consensus definitions are possible despite differences in terminology and language, prevalence, and manifestations of the disease in different countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A global consensus definition for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> may simplify disease management, allow collaborative research, and make studies more generalizable, assisting patients, physicians, and regulatory agencies </plain></SENT>
