<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barretts esophagus</z:hpo>, the major risk factor for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, is detected in approximately 10%-14% of individuals submitted to upper endoscopy for the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> related symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prevalence studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barretts esophagus</z:hpo> in individuals without typical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> have reported rates ranging from 0.6% to 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the prevalence of Barretts in a Brazilian population older than 50 years without typical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 104 patients (51 men), mean age of 65 years, with an indication for upper endoscopy but without symptoms of heartburn and/or acid regurgitation (determined with a validated questionnaire) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects submitted to upper endoscopic examination in the last 10 years or using antisecretory medication (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi>) during the last 6 months were not included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">Methylene blue</z:chebi> chromoscopy was performed during the endoscopic exam to facilitate identification of the metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barretts esophagus</z:hpo> was diagnosed endoscopically and confirmed by histology in four patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The metaplastic segment was short (less than 3 cm) and free of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barretts esophagus</z:hpo> was 7.75% in the male population and 3.8% in the general population studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to the low prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barretts esophagus</z:hpo> found in the present study, associated with the finding of short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barretts esophagus</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases diagnosed and the absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the material analyzed, endoscopic screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barretts esophagus</z:hpo> in patients above the age of 50 without the classical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> is not indicated for the Brazilian population </plain></SENT>
