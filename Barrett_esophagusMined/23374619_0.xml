<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in patients with and without reflux symptoms and to determine whether this association is reflux independent and metabolically driven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case patients with BE and controls were residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (1999-2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two control groups (one with and one without symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>) were identified from a cohort of patients who had responded to a validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases and controls were individually matched by age, sex, and duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls did not have a known diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and its individual components with BE was assessed using univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression separately for each control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 309 patients were included (103 BE cases, 103 controls with reflux symptoms, and 103 controls without reflux symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 64% of cases, 47% of controls with reflux symptoms, and 50% of controls without reflux symptoms had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of BE relative to those with (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.10-3.65; P=.02) and without (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.03-3.60; P=.04) reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association was independent of smoking, alcohol consumption, and body mass index and remained robust with sensitivity analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> is associated with BE independent of reflux symptoms, which may reflect a reflux-independent pathway of BE pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
