<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between dietary glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), total carbohydrate, <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi>, and fiber intakes and the risk of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-Ireland study, dietary information was collected from patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 224), long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 220), reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n = 219), and population-based controls (n = 256) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis examined the association between dietary variables and disease risk by tertiles of intake and as continuous variables, while adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> risk was positively associated with <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> intake and negatively associated with sugar intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> risk was significantly reduced in people in the highest versus the lowest tertile of fiber intake (OR 0.44 95%CI 0.25-0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fiber intake was also associated with a reduced risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, as was total carbohydrate intake (OR 0.45 95%CI 0.33-0.61 per 50 g/d increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, an increased esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> risk was detected per 10 unit increase in GI intake (OR 1.42 95%CI 1.07-1.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that fiber intake is inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> risk is inversely associated with total carbohydrate consumption but positively associated with high GI intakes </plain></SENT>
