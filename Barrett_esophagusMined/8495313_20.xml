<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four animals underwent total gastrectomy and oesophagojejunostomy, inducing reflux of duodenal contents into the oesophagus, and were divided into two groups: an 'acid' group, which drank syrup water with <z:chebi fb="63" ids="17883">hydrochloric acid</z:chebi> (pH 1.8), and a 'non-acid' group, which drank only syrup water (pH 6.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four rats were killed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Reflux oesophagitis</z:e> was found in the lower portion of the oesophagus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Columnar epithelium was observed in the oesophagus of one rat in the non-acid group at week 8 and of three in the acid group at week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the development of columnar epithelium of the oesophagus is preceded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e> and that acidic conditions may promote this change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Columnar epithelialization may result from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of squamous epithelium as well as from upward extension of columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
