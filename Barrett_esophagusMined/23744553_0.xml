<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> develops in a scenario of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, linked to free radical formation and oxidative DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, the main oxidative DNA adduct, is partially repaired by a glycosylase (OGG1) whose polymorphism is associated to a reduced repair capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telomeres are particularly prone to oxidative damage, which leads to shortening and cell senescence, while elongation, by telomerase activity, is linked to cell immortalization and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Limited data are available on this point with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the link among 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, OGG1 polymorphism, telomerase activity, telomere length, and p53 mutation in Barrett progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with short- and long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and 20 controls with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of biopsy samples was undertaken to study 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels, OGG1 polymorphism, telomerase activity, and telomere length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were obtained for p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Controls had significantly lower levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and telomerase activity, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> telomere length and no p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels were higher and telomeres underwent significant shortening, with stimulation of telomerase activity but no p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine reached maximal levels, with telomere elongation, and 42Â % of the patients showed p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Barrett patients, with disease progression, oxidative DNA damage accumulates, causing telomere instability, telomerase activation, and, in a late phase, mutations in the p53 gene, thus abrogating its activity as the checkpoint of proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and facilitating progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
