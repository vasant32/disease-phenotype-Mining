<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: There is a controversy as to whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) exists as a spectrum of disease severity or as a categorial disease in three distinct groups: nonerosive (NERD) and erosive reflux disease (ERD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of the study was to assess progression or regression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> over 2 yr in a large cohort of patients (N = 3,894) under routine clinical care in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland (ProGERD study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients with predominant heartburn, with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, were recruited and classified according to endoscopic status at baseline, i.e., NERD, erosive reflux disease-Los Angeles (ERD-LA) grade A/B and ERD-LA grade C/D, and BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After an initial treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi>, they were followed, regardless of their response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical therapy or endoscopy was initiated at the discretion of their primary care physician, in line with routine care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 2 yr, endoscopy with biopsy was performed according to the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 2 yr, 25% of patients who had NERD at baseline progressed to LA A/B and 0.6% to LA C/D; 1.6% of patients who had LA A/B progressed to LA C/D and 61% regressed to NERD; 42% of patients who had LA C/D regressed to LA A/B and 50% regressed to NERD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> figures exclude patients with confirmed BE at baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 2 yr, 22% of patients had been off medication for at least 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with ERD-LA grade C/D were at greatest risk of developing BE: 5.8% compared with 1.4% for ERD-LA grade A/B and 0.5% for NERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> does not seem to be a categorial disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Progression and regression between grades was observed in this large cohort of patients under routine clinical care </plain></SENT>
