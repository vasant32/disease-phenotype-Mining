<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It concentrates primarily on the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> vitamins A, C and E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 180 subjects included in the trial, 109 males and 71 females, which were divided in the four groups (70 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, 20 patients with BE, 20 patients with EADC, and 70 healthy examinees composing a control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> vitamins intake was investigated through the usage of the dietary questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concentration of the mentioned <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> vitamin in serum was detected by HPLC method, and although there were no major statistical differences in their levels between four groups, there existed a correlation between the vitamin serum concentration and the rephlux disease degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the healthy examinees had consumed the greater quantities of the vitamins A, C and E, through both the natural (fruits and vegetables) and the supplementary (industrial vitamin additives) way, than the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, BE and EADC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was reflected in the higher serum levels of the mentioned vitamins in the first group in the comparison with the second group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on this, the intake of the vitamins A, C and E through both the natural and the supplementary ways is suggested in order to prevent the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, BE and EADC </plain></SENT>
