<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic trials of vitamin A and related compounds have demonstrated activity in several cancerous and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous conditions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors measured the effects of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-retinoic acid</z:chebi>, and a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi>, on the human immune system in vivo in conjunction with their use in ongoing clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immune cell subpopulations were analyzed by quantifying the expression of markers using flow cytometric study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both compounds produced significant effects on immune cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-Retinoic acid</z:chebi> resulted in an increase in the percentage of peripheral blood lymphoid cells expressing surface markers for T-helper cells with only minimal effect on natural killer cell marker expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> produced an increase in the percentage of cells expressing natural killer cell markers with smaller effect on T-helper markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Modest increases in the percentage of cells expressing Ia antigen, transferrin, and interleukin-2 receptors were produced by both drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoids</z:chebi> can produce major changes in immune cellular marker expression in vivo in humans at doses relevant to their potential clinical use </plain></SENT>
