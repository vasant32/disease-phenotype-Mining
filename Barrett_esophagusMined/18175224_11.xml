<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Hippo (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32363">Hpo</z:chebi>) pathway is highly conserved in humans and was originally uncovered in Drosophila as a potent regulator of inhibiting cell growth and promoting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Hippo pathway consists of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor kinase cascade that negatively regulates growth and results in inactivation of a transcriptional co-activator, Yorkie (yki) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human ortholog of Yki, the yes-associated protein (YAP), has a 31% sequence identity and similar biologic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The potential role of YAP in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> was also reported in a murine genetic screen which identified a genomic amplification of YAP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: Given this pathway's critical control of cell growth, survival, proliferation, and amplification in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, we wanted to explore the possible role of the Hippo pathway in human esophageal and gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The expression of YAP was evaluated with immunolabeling of esophageal and gastric tissue microarrays from 169 patients, with nondysplastic, dysplastic, and malignant foci represented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic and nuclear staining were scored as 0 = none, 1 &lt; 10%, 2 = 10-50%, and 3 &gt; 50% for the nonneoplastic, dysplastic, and malignant epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple scores were averaged for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of YAP could be seen in the proliferating compartments of nonneoplastic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to nonneoplastic epithelium, there was a significant increase in YAP cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in high-grade dysplastic epithelium and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant increase in YAP cytoplasmic and nuclear staining of gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric disease</z:e> compared to nonneoplastic gastric tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: YAP expression in the cytoplasm and nucleus is significantly increased in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric disease</z:e>, suggesting a role for this recently uncovered pathway in esophageal and gastric epithelial <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
