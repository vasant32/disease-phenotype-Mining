<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Monitoring of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, currently done by systematic biopsy, can be improved through increasing the proportion of at-risk tissue examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Optical biopsy techniques, which do not remove the tissue but interrogate the tissue with light, offer a potential method to improve the monitoring of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequency-domain angle resolved low-coherence interferometry (fa/LCI) is an optical spectroscopic technique applied through an endoscopic fiber bundle and measures the depth-resolved nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of tissue, a key biomarker for identifying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic capability of fa/LCI for differentiating healthy and dysplastic tissue in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Depth-resolved angular scattering data are acquired by using fa/LCI from tissue excised from 3 patients who had esophagogastrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data are processed to determine the average nuclear size and density as a function of depth beneath the tissue surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data are compared with the pathologic classification of the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Average of depth-resolved nuclear diameter and nuclear density measurements in tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Upon comparison to pathologic diagnosis, the fa/LCI data results report the nuclear atypia characteristic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the epithelial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Examination of the average nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> over the superficial 150 mum results in complete separation between healthy columnar and BE dysplastic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Lack of in vivo data; lack of nondysplastic BE data because of limited sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In complicated tissue structures, such as BE, depth-resolved nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> measurements provided an excellent means to identify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The preliminary results demonstrate the great potential for the in vivo application of fa/LCI as a targeting mechanism for physical biopsy in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
