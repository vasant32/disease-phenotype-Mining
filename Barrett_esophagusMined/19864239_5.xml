<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To ascertain the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in esophagi resected for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) using current criteria and to evaluate histologic features that may predict concurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, we studied specimens from 127 esophagectomies performed for HGD, or HGD "suspicious" for <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (HGD/S) in Barrett mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Corresponding biopsy specimens in 69 cases were reviewed and reclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on original diagnoses, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was present in 15 (17%) of 89 HGD and 28 (74%) of 38 HGD/S cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By reclassification, only 1 (5%) of 21 cases with HGD had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the resection specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 25 cases reclassified as HGD/S, 18 (72%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the resection specimen, as did 17 (74%) of 23 reclassified as <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With 1 additional select histologic feature, the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was 39%; with 2 or more features, the risk increased to 83% to 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on current criteria, no more than 5% of esophagectomies performed for a biopsy diagnosis of Barrett HGD harbor <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When HGD/S is diagnosed based on certain additional features, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is found in nearly 40% of cases with 1 feature and more than 80% with 2 or more features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings highlight the evolution of diagnostic criteria for Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
