<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Barrett's mucosa is a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_165'>glandular metaplasia</z:mpath> of the squamous epithelium that develops in the lower esophagus in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and is considered as a precursor for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p63 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expressions were studied by Western blot and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DCA exposure at pH 5 led to a spectacular decrease in the levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> isoforms of the p63 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This decrease was observed within minutes of exposure, with a synergistic effect between DCA and acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the same time frame, levels of p63 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were relatively unaffected, whereas levels of COX-2, a marker of stress responses often induced in Barrett's mucosa, were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">chenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> but not its <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> conjugate at pH 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proteasome inhibition by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52722">lactacystin</z:chebi> or MG-132 partially blocked the decrease in p63, suggesting a posttranslational degradation mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that combined exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> and acid downregulates a critical regulator of squamous differentiation, providing a mechanism to explain the replacement of squamous epithelium by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_165'>glandular metaplasia</z:mpath> upon exposure of the lower esophagus to gastric reflux </plain></SENT>
