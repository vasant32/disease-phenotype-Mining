<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis for this study is that turmeric will have distinctive effects from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> due to the presence of other bioactive compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty Eight-week old Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into three oral feeding groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1, standard rat chow, Control diet - <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIN</z:e> 93M, group 2 - <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> - 700ppm or 0.7g/kg diet, and group 3 - Turmeric - 14,000ppm or 14g/kg diet for a total of 3weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One group of rats were feed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three diets only and another group underwent esophagoduodenal anastomosis to evaluate the effects of bioavailability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> diet did not increase the transcription of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of TNF-alpha, IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average fold change in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> level was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas turmeric diet increases the levels of IL-6 (1.9-fold, p=0.05), iNOS (4.39-fold, p=0.02), IL-8 (3.11-fold, p=0.04), and COX-2 (2.02-fold, p=0.05), suggesting that turmeric either was more bioavailable or had more affect on pro-inflammatory genes compare to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated the molecular effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> and turmeric in the role as an anti-inflammatory therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, significant bioavailable differences do occur and must be considered in further chemopreventative investigative trials the setting of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and other upper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
