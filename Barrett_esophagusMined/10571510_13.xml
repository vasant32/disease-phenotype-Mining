<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to determine whether FasL expression, and therefore FasL-dependent immune evasion, occurs early during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM) of the esophagus, and in the large intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sections of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from esophageal and large bowel biopsies and resection specimens were immunostained for FasL using standard immunoperoxidase technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of positive cells was correlated with the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BM and with the size and villous architecture of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In BM, FasL was detected in 55% of cases negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of BM (100%) with low- or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were FasL-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the large intestine, 25% of small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were negative for FasL, and FasL overexpression was significantly more frequent in larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with tubulovillous or villous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that (1) FasL overexpression is acquired early during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of BM and the large bowel and (2) FasL overexpression occurs relatively earlier during malignant progression of BM than the large bowel, probably as a result of the preceding repeated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
