<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is increasing, and its treatment is problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antireflux surgery has the potential to stop reflux and induce a quiescent mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its long-term outcome, however, has recently been challenged with reports of poor control of reflux and the inability to prevent progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The outcome of antireflux surgery was studied in 97 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was complete in 88% (85/97) at a median of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine had long-segment and 26 short-segment Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the cardia were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients underwent a laparoscopic procedure, 20 a transthoracic procedure, and 3 abdominal Nissen operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine had a Collis-Belsey procedure and three had other partial wraps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included relief of reflux symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>), patients' perception of the result (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>), upper endoscopy and histology (n = 79), and postoperative 24-hour pH monitoring (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 5 years, reflux symptoms were absent in 67 of 85 patients (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (20%) developed recurrent symptoms; four had returned to taking daily acid-suppression medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seven patients underwent a secondary repair and were asymptomatic, increasing the eventual successful outcome to 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recurrent symptoms were most common in patients undergoing Collis-Belsey (33%) and laparoscopic Nissen (26%) procedures and least common after a transthoracic Nissen operation (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results of postoperative 24-hour pH monitoring were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 17 of 21 (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> were detected in 17 of 79 patients studied; 6 were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven percent of the patients considered themselves cured, 22% considered their condition to be improved, and 97% were satisfied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> regressed to nondysplastic Barrett's in 7 of 16 (44%), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> regressed to cardiac mucosa in 9 of 63 (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> developed in 4 of 63 (6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>No patient developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in 410 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After antireflux surgery, most patients with Barrett's enjoy long-lasting relief of reflux symptoms, and nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients consider themselves cured or improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Mild symptoms recur in one fifth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Importantly, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> regressed in nearly half of the patients in whom it was present before surgery, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> disappeared in 14% of patients, and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were prevented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
