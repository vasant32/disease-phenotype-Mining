<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) may be associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), there are currently no studies that evaluate resource utilization in Barrett's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were 1) to determine the cost and number of endoscopies and clinic visits to the GI clinic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> or its complications in patients with BE; 2) to determine the pattern and cost of medication use in patients with BE; and 3) to compare medication use by patients with BE to that of patients with insulin-requiring <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the cost distribution report data and the pharmacy acquisition costs from the Durham VAMC, we calculated the monthly cost of endoscopies, clinic visits related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, and medication use in 53 patients with BE between 1/1/94 and 1/1/97 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also calculated the average cost of medication use for 55 patients with insulin-requiring DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with BE were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 64.0 yr (IQR 57-68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of them, 92% were white; 23% had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with LGD were more likely to have more than three endoscopies in 3 yr than were those with no LGD (OR 6.3, 95% CI 1.11-35.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in clinic visits in the patients with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (OR 0.335, 95% CI 0.093-1.206) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 139 endoscopies and 172 clinic visits were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Outpatient care for patients with BE costs approximately $103/month or $1241/yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopies and clinic visits accounted for 31.1% and 5.9% of the monthly medical cost, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Medications accounted for 63% of the total cost of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prokinetic agents accounted for 0.8% of the total cost of medications, whereas <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (H2 blockers) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) accounted for 34.6% and 64.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Medication cost per month in patients with BE was approximately $65, similar to that of patients with insulin-requiring DM ($63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our conclusions were as follows: 1) Outpatient care for patients with BE costs approximately $1241/yr or ($103/month) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>2) Medication use per month accounted for more than half of the total cost; <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> accounted for 64.6% of total medication cost, suggesting that reflux was severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>3) Consistent with current surveillance strategies, patients with LGD had more frequent endoscopy than patients with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>4) Medication cost per month in patients with BE is similar to that in patients with DM, another group with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>5) Those who make health policy can use these results to compare the cost of care of patients with BE to the cost for those with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> medical disorders </plain></SENT>
