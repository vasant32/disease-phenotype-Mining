<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to establish an animal model for studying the cause and prevention of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) and its frequent precursor, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), factors affecting the pathogenic processes were investigated in an esophagoduodenal anastomosis model with rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiments by us and others have shown that surgical treatment produced reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> with cell hyperproliferation, but not EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional treatment with a carcinogen has been shown to be necessary for the development of EAC, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) or EAC/<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> mixtures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the surgically treated animals developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> due possibly to reduced iron absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the operated animals were supplemented with iron, EAC occurred at a high rate (73%) after 30 weeks, and treatment with N'-nitrosonornicotine did not enhance the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with carcinogen, however, induced <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> in the group of rats killed after 22 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, which is known to cause oxidative damage, is an enhancing factor for adenocarcinogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of EAC in the iron-supplemented, non-carcinogen treated group resembles human esophageal adenocarcinogenesis in many features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the BE was the specialized type with goblet cells (containing sialomucin or sulfomucin) and columnar cells (containing acid or neutral mucin) as well as an incompletely developed brush border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the BE was located at the bottom of the esophagus and was continuous with the duodenal mucosa; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> became more frequent at later time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were well-differentiated mucinous EAC, and most of the EAC had an adjacent area of BE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent with the proposed human sequence for pathogenic events of BE progression to 'BE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>' and then to EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Esophagoduodenal anastomosis and iron treatment in rats produces a high rate of BE and EAC which are morphologically similar to human BE and EAC; this may be a useful animal model to study the development and prevention of EAC in humans </plain></SENT>
