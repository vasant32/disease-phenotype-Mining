<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In humans, trefoil <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (TFF <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>) and some mucins have been reported to be expressed in a cell-specific manner at mucosal surfaces of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastrointestinal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic conditions cause characteristic changes of these expression patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study such patterns in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the oesophagus (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>), the distribution of MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC and the three TFF <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (TFF1, TFF2 and TFF3) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 40 archival samples of <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> and in 21 samples of Barret's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, expression of the three mucins and two TFF <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (TFF1 and TFF2) was assessed by specific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR) was performed on frozen tissue samples from the 11 biopsies of <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> for the three TFF <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemical tests for MUC2 and TFF2 were negative both in samples of Barret's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and in <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MUC1 expression was detected in 57.5% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> samples, while TFF1 and MUC5AC were found in 10% and 7.5% of the cases respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> MUC1 was detected in 90.5% of the cases and TFF1 and MUC5AC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR analysis revealed a more complex pattern: TFF1 and TFF3 expressed the corresponding <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples investigated; the third member, TFF2, was active in 45.5% of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> biopsies and not in the corresponding native tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This finding in oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> contrasts with the situation found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic stomach epithelium where TFF1 and TFF2 are found co-expressed and TFF3 remains silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, MUC1 is expressed in a significant proportion of <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both in Barett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and in <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> the expression of MUC5AC mirrors the TFF1 synthesis in intensity and spatial distribution </plain></SENT>
