<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: It is known that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression is increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied COX-2 expression and the effect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> has on the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in rats undergoing esophagogastroduodenal anastomosis (EGDA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one rats were divided into a control group (n=27), a 500 ppm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi>-treated group (n=15) and 1000 ppm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi>-treated group (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Randomly selected rats were killed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35702">diethyl ether</z:chebi> inhalation at 20 and 40 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 40 weeks, rats treated with 1000 ppm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> showed narrower esophageal diameter and milder <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> than the control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 40 weeks, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was similar between control and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi>-treated groups, but the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was significantly lower in the 1000 ppm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi>-treated group than either the control or 500 ppm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi>-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>COX-2 was significantly increased in the lower esophagus of control rats killed at 40 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 expression was negligible in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi>- treated group compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that the chemopreventive effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> is related to decreased COX-2 and cyclin D1 expression, which may be influenced by reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
