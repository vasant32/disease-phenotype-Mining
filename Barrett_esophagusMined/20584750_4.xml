<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The specific aims of this study were to investigate whether NO can induce invasion in cells representative of different stages of Barrett's progression and to determine possible underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physiological concentrations of NO that mimic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> production of NO from dietary sources enhanced invasion in cell lines from high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (GihTERT) and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (FLO) but not a non-dysplastic Barrett's cell line (QhTERT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that NO induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -3, -7, -9 and -10 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, -2 and -3 in these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ex vivo treatment of Barrett's biopsy samples with NO induced increases in MMP-1 and TIMP-1 expression, suggesting that NO enhances invasion through deregulating MMP and TIMP expression in epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In keeping with these findings, microarray analysis and immunohistochemistry performed on biopsy samples showed enhanced expression of MMP-1, -3, -7 and -10 and TIMP-1 in the progression from non-dysplastic BO to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, although this could not be directly attributed to the effect of NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, NO may play a role in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> through deregulating MMP and TIMP expression to enhance invasive potential </plain></SENT>
