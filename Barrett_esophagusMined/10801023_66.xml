<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presentation, stage distribution, and treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> using the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Database of the American College of Surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Consecutively accessed patients (n = 5,044) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> from 828 hospitals during 1994 were evaluated in 1997 for case mix, diagnostic tests, and treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 67.3 years with a male to female ratio of 3:1; non-Hispanic Caucasians made up most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 16.6% reported no tobacco use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> (74%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (57.3%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0599290" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal reflux</z:e> (20.5%), odynophagia (16.6%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> (12.1%) were the most common symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 50% of patients had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in the lower third of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 51.6% had squamous cell histology and 41.9% had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> occurred in 777 patients, or 39% of those with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of those patients that underwent surgery initially, pathology revealed stage I (13.3%), II (34.7%), III (35.7%), and IV (12.3%) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patients with various stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137,C0751688" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous cell cancer</z:e>, radiation therapy plus chemotherapy were the most common treatment modalities (39.5%) compared with surgery plus adjuvant therapy (13.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, surgery plus adjuvant therapy were the most common treatment methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Disease-specific overall survival at 1 year was 43%, ranging from 70% to 18% from stages I to IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0152018" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer of the esophagus</z:e> shows an increasing occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the lower third of the esophagus and is frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Choice of treatment was influenced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histology and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Multimodality (neoadjuvant) therapy was the most common treatment method for patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The use of multimodality treatment did not appear to increase postoperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
