<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon-cancer</z:hpo> screening using stool-guaiac testing has been established in large control populations, but not in dialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 72 asymptomatic dialysis patients [51 treated with hemodialysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), and 21 with peritoneal dialysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>)] who underwent outpatient stool occult blood testing, the test result was positive in 11 (15%) patients (8 HD and 3 PD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 11 were investigated further by colonoscopy and, when deemed necessary by the treating physician, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and/or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A site of active <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was identified in three of the eight patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each of the five other patients, potentially <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> lesions were identified: <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp> (two malignant and two benign) in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in one, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulosis</z:e> in two, and colonic vascular deformities in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were compared with those of a large ongoing fecal occult blood screening program in which the prevalence of positive stool occult blood tests is 5% and in which 42% of the positive patients have colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, although the baseline incidence of positive guaiac tests may be higher in dialysis patients than in nonuremic controls, our results suggest that stool guaiac testing of dialysis patients may not only be useful in detecting <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp>, but may also identify other previously unsuspected causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
