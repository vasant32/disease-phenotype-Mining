<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> be classified as three different types: distal esophageal (AEG I), cardia (AEG II), and subcardia (AEG III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis, one recent study reported that the 14q chromosomal arm showed a significantly higher rate of deletion in esophageal than in cardia <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a microsatellite analysis technique, we analyzed this area and regions in the vicinity of the APC, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>, and p53 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues were microdissected from 54 cases (27 AEG I and 27 AEG III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted and then amplified using seven fluorescent-labeled microsatellite markers, one pair each on 5q, 18q, and 17p and four on 14q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LOH varied from 20% to 30% at each locus except for the 17p locus, where it was slightly above 50% in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in LOH or MSI were found between the esophageal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastric tumors</z:e>, including the 14q chromosomal arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results fail to confirm the finding that abnormalities on the 14q chromosomal arm distinguish between distal esophageal and proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastric tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
