<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: When to perform oesophagectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some resect for high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> whereas others defer treatment until intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement for a diagnosis of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> remains unknown and may have therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Histological slides from 75 oesophagectomy specimens with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or T(1) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were blindly reviewed by two gastrointestinal pathologists and one general surgical pathologist, and classified as high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, or submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subsequent re-review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 75 cases by the same observers following establishment of uniform histological criteria was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was determined by kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coefficients &lt;0.21, 0.21-0.40, 0.41-0.60, 0.61-0.80, and &gt;0.80 were considered poor, fair, moderate, good, and very good agreement, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interobserver agreement among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathologists and between gastrointestinal pathologists when comparing high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was only fair (k=0.42; 0.56, respectively) and did not substantially improve on subsequent re-evaluation following establishment of uniform histological criteria (K=0.50; 0.61, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When evaluating resection specimens and after implementation of uniform histological criteria, even experienced gastrointestinal pathologists frequently disagree on a diagnosis of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> versus intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment strategies based on the histological distinction of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> using limited biopsy specimens should be re-evaluated </plain></SENT>
