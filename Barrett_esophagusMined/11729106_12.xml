<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> after partial gastrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data of outpatients from a medicine and gastroenterology clinic who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for any reason were analyzed in a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A case population of 650 patients with short- segment and 366 patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was compared in a multivariate logistic regression to a control population of 3047 subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the case population, 25 (4%) patients with short-segment and 15 (4%) patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> presented with a history of gastric surgery compared with 162 (5%) patients in the control population, yielding an adjusted odds ratio of 0.89 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.54-1.46 for short-segment and an adjusted odds ratio of 0.71 (0.30-1.72) for long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in separate analyses of 64 patients with Billroth-1 gastrectomy, 105 patients with Billroth-2 gastrectomy, and 33 patients with vagotomy and pyloroplasty for both short- and long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caucasian ethnicity, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>, and alcohol consumption were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with elevated risks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gastric surgery for benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease is not a risk factor for either short- or long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This lack of association between gastric surgery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> suggests that reflux of bile without acid is not sufficient to damage the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
