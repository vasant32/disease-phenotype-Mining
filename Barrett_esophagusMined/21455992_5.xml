<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-Ireland case-control study, dietary intake data were collected using a food frequency questionnaire in 219 RE patients, 220 BE patients, 224 EAC patients and 256 frequency-matched controls between 2002 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unconditional multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between dietary variables and disease risk using quartiles of intake, to attain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), while adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in the highest quartile of total fat intake had a higher risk of RE (OR = 3.54; 95% CI = 1.32-9.46) and EAC (OR = 5.44; 95% CI = 2.08-14.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A higher risk of RE and EAC was also reported for patients in the highest quartile of saturated fat intake (OR = 2.79; 95% CI = 1.11-7.04; OR = 2.41; 95% CI = 1.14-5.08, respectively) and monounsaturated fat intake (OR = 2.63; 95% CI = 1.01-6.86; OR = 5.35; 95% CI = 2.14-13.34, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the highest quartile of fresh red meat intake had a higher risk of EAC (OR = 3.15; 95% CI = 1.38-7.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the highest category of processed meat intake had a higher risk of RE (OR = 4.67; 95% CI = 1.71-12.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No consistent associations were seen for BE with either fat or meat intakes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies investigating the association between dietary fat and food sources of fat are needed to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
