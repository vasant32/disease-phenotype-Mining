<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of the specialized columnar type is described in which mucosal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase levels were measured in endoscopic biopsies at two intervals over which severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Barrett's mucosa extended 5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction, was free of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and had no detectable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase activity at initial evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On follow-up endoscopy one year later, the Barrett's mucosa had become dysplastic with a markedly elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase activity of 1.56 units/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent an esophagectomy because of persistent severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and continues to do well postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase activity has been described in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant conditions</z:e>, especially when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> has been present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are warranted, since <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> activity might prove to be a useful biochemical marker for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
