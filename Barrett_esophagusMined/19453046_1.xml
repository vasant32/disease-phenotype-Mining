<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine the gender differences in the age-stratified prevalence of EE and Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The study population comprised 869 cases (463 men and 406 women) who had undergone an upper endoscopy at the Gastroenterology Division of Yokohama City University Hospital between August 2005 and July 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EE was graded according to the Los Angeles Classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed based on the Prague C &amp; M Criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In contrast to the decrease of the proportion of EE with aging in males, that in females remained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the suppressive effect of the increased gastric mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> associated with aging was wiped out by the age-related effect of the increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportions of Barrett's epithelium in both males and females increased with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, the prevalence of elderly females complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, which was partly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo>, may affect the proportion of EE and probably Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
