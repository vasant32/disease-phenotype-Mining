<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and overall contribution of specific gene amplification events in the formation of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship of gene amplification to clinical-pathological variables and its potential usefulness as a marker for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used quantitative PCR and Southern blot analysis to screen 87 cases of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> for the presence or absence of 13 distinct gene amplification events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene amplification was then examined for correlation with other amplification events and clinical variables (survival, stage, nodal involvement, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion, smoking history, and gender) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 22 specimens of Barrett's with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) were examined for the presence of gene amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One or more amplification events were present in 50 of 87 (57%) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ERBB2 gene was amplified in 19 of 87 (21.8%), CCNE1 in 11 of 87 (12.6%), GATA4 in 9 of 87 (10.3%), KRAS in 9 of 87 (10.3%), EGFR in 7 of 87 (8.0%), CCND1 in 6 of 87 (6.8%), HNF3alpha in 5 of 87 (5.7%), PIK3CA in 5 of 87 (5.7%), C-MYC in 4 of 87 (4.6%), DYRK2 in 2 of 87 (2.3%), and AIB1, AKT1, and IGF1R were amplified in 0 of 87 (0%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CCND1 amplification was found to correlate negatively with survival (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ERBB2 amplicon positively correlated (P &lt; 0.05) with GATA4 amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased copy number of the ERBB2 (1 of 22), GATA4 (1 of 22), KRAS (2 of 22), C-MYC (1 of 22), CCNE1 (2 of 22), and CCND1 (2 of 22) genes was also observed in one or more Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> with HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of gene amplification in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and HGD indicates the important role of these events in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these results underscore the possible usefulness of early detection approaches and chemotherapeutic strategies (ErbB2 and cyclin D1) targeted against amplified gene products </plain></SENT>
