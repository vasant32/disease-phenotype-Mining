<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the quality of Barrett's surveillance in daily practice in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A structured scoring list was developed to evaluate systematically the quality of endoscopy and pathology reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 15 hospitals, endoscopy reports and corresponding pathology reports were selected randomly and evaluated by two observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In case of disagreement, the observers re-evaluated the reports in a consensus meeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and fifty cases were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adherence to current standard biopsy protocols (four quadrant biopsies every 2 cm) decreased with increasing Barrett's length: 0-5 cm: 79%; 5-10 cm: 50%; 10-15 cm: 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The indication for the endoscopy was mentioned in 28% of the pathology reports, in 4% the presence/absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> was communicated, and in 19% the location and/or aetiology of biopsies was described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence/absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was mentioned in 93% of pathology reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endoscopy reports and pathology reports in current practice do not include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant information for an adequate Barrett's surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In short <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, the adherence to current standard biopsy protocols is acceptable, but in longer segments (with a higher risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>) this is clearly insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The communication between endoscopists and pathologist is suboptimal </plain></SENT>
