<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of acid and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in esophageal squamous cell lines derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> patients with (NES-B3T) and without (NES-G2T) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and in a Barrett's epithelial cell line (BAR-T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells were incubated with an ROS-sensitive probe and exposed to acidic medium, neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> medium, or acidic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ROS were quantified in the presence and absence of diphenyleneiodonium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (DPI, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50423">NADPH oxidase inhibitor</z:chebi>), N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA, a nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibitor), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">rotenone</z:chebi> (a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> electron transport chain inhibitor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acidic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> medium induced ROS production in both squamous cell lines; however, only DPI blocked ROS production by NES-B3T cells, whereas both DPI and l-NMMA blocked ROS production by NES-G2T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In BAR-T cells, acidic medium and acidic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> medium induced the production of ROS; l-NMMA prevented ROS production after exposure to acidic medium, whereas ROS production induced by acidic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> medium was blocked by DPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that there are differences between esophageal squamous cells and Barrett's epithelial cells and between esophageal squamous cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in the mechanisms of oxidant production induced by exposure to acid and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
