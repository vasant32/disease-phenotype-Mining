<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with BE/HGD but esophagectomy can be associated with high morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to report our preliminary experience in applying minimally invasive surgical techniques to esophagectomy for BE/HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From August 1996 to February 1999, 12 consecutive patients underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy for biopsy-proven BE/HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our consort consisted of 7 men and 5 women; average age was 64 years (range, 40-78 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a complete laparoscopic or combined laparoscopic and thoracoscopic resection of the esophagus with cervical anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean operative time was 7.8 +/- 2.1 hours, mean intensive care unit stay was 2.6 +/- 2.2 days, and mean length of hospital stay was 8.3 +/- 4.7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients (42%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> identified on pathologic specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analyses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resected lymph nodes in the 12 patients were negative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 6 major complications in 5 patients: 1 patient had a small bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> requiring operative repair, 2 patients needed prolonged ventilatory support for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo>, and 3 patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>delayed gastric emptying</z:mp> requiring revision of the pyloromyotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The single minor complication in this series was a jejunostomy tube-site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no conversions to laparotomy or thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were alive and free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> at a mean follow-up of 12.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive esophagectomy is a feasible and safe alternative to conventional open esophagectomy for patients with BE/HGD </plain></SENT>
