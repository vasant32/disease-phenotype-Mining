<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this prospective trial, we studied patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> by 24-h intraesophageal pH monitoring after having completely eliminated their reflux symptoms with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi>, to determine whether they had achieved normalization of intraesophageal pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had presented with reflux symptoms, were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> (15-30 mg/day) until they were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour ambulatory pH monitoring was performed while they were receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> and were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (40%) showed persistent bipositional, pathologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> while on therapy, with a mean DeMeester score of 52.8 (95% CI: 33.8-71.8); the remaining 18 (60%) exhibited normalization of intraesophageal acid exposure with a score of 4.4 (95% CI: 2.3-6.6,p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This inadequate control of intraesophageal pH is most likely due to incomplete gastric acid suppression induced by the drug and is associated with a variable acid (distal &gt; proximal) exposure within the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two groups were not different in regard to their symptom frequency and severity before therapy, amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> dosage required to eliminate symptoms, length of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, lower esophageal sphincter resting tone and length, or esophageal peristaltic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Complete symptom eradication with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> (15-30 mg daily) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> does not guarantee normalization of intraesophageal pH profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the goal of therapy in such patients is to achieve complete intraesophageal acid suppression, 24-h ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring should be performed to titrate therapy </plain></SENT>
