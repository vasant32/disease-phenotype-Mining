<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bile reflux</z:e> contributes to the development of esophageal injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is absent in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium of the esophagus but is strongly expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether and how <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> influence the expression of MUC5AC in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: MUC5AC expression was studied by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting in human tissues, in tissues from a rat model of BE, and in SKGT-4 cultured esophageal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MUC5AC transcription was studied by real-time polymerase chain reaction and transient transfection assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: MUC5AC was absent from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium but was present in 100% of Barrett specimens and in 61.5% of human esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissues that were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MUC5AC protein expression was induced to a greater degree by conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> than by unconjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi>, and this occurred at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the rat reflux model, MUC5AC mucin was expressed abundantly in tissues of BE stimulated by duodenoesophageal reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> induced AKT phosphorylation in SKGT-4 cells but had no effect on extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or protein-38 kinase phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and a dominant-negative protein kinase C (AKT) construct prevented the induction of MUC5AC by conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transactivation of AP-1 by conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> coincided with MUC5AC induction, and cotransfection with a dominant-negative activator protein-1 (AP-1) vector decreased MUC5AC transcription and its induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> in the bile refluxate contribute to MUC5AC induction in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This occurs at the level of transcription and involves activation of the PI3K/AKT/AP-1 pathway </plain></SENT>
