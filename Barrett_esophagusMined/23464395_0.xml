<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> frequently arises from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We postulated that β-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi> therapy maybe protective in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and Method: We conducted a prospective study in which 25 mg of β-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi> was administered daily for six-months to six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent upper endoscopy before and after therapy and multiple mucosal biopsies were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, patients completed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) symptoms questionnaire before and after therapy and severity score was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To study the effect of β-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi> at molecular level, tissue extracts of the esophageal mucosal biopsy were subjected to assessment of heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: A significant (p&lt;0.05) reduction in mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms severity score from 7.0±2.4 to 2.7±1.7 following β-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi> therapy was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurement of Barrett's segment also revealed a significant reduction in mean length after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In fact, two patients had complete disappearance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, marked enhancement of HSP70 expression was demonstrated in biopsy specimens from Barrett's epithelium in four cases that were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Long- term β-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi> therapy realizes amelioration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms along with restitution of the histological and molecular changes in esophageal mucosa of patients with BE, associated with concurrent increase in mucosal HSP70 expression </plain></SENT>
