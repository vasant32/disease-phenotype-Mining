<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Current endoscopic mucosal resection techniques are suboptimal for large circumferential mucosal resections intended to treat Barrett mucosa with multicentric foci of high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rigid modified endoscope was developed for extended endoscopic mucosal resection in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This pilot animal study investigated the feasibility of circumferential endoscopic mucosal resections of different lengths in the sheep esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Circumferential esophageal endoscopic mucosal resections of 2.2 cm (n = 6), 3.3 cm (n = 6), 4.4 cm (n = 7), and 5.5 cm (n = 5) were performed in 24 sheep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circumferential resections consisted of two opposite hemicircumferential mucosectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were followed up with endoscopic examinations at 1 week and then monthly to 6 months, or until complete re-epithelialization without stenosis eventually ensued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strictures were treated with a single or repeated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> with Savary bougies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Circumferential resections 2.2 to 5.5 cm in length were successfully performed in 23 of 24 of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> occurred directly after mucosectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accurate depth of resection through the submucosa was obtained in 85% of the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cicatricial stenosis was controlled in 95% by bougienage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endoscopic mucosal resection performed with the rigid esophagoscope allowed extensive circumferential resections in a single session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is thus potential to eradicate complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
