<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of an endoscopic biopsy protocol in patients with neoplastic abnormalities in Barrett's epithelium without obvious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative diagnoses in 28 patients who underwent surgery for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and compared them with 22 other patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> who were maintained under prospective endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 50 patients lacked gross lesions to suggest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic protocol involved rigorous, systematic acquisition of multiple, large biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 64% of patients had minimal but distinct endoscopic abnormalities that were targeted for biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> alone (7 patients) was differentiated from early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (19 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients with preoperative diagnoses of intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in their resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This endoscopic protocol accurately detects and differentiates high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> alone in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> detected by such a protocol do not necessarily require surgical resection to rule out an undiagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; electing for surgery should be based on other clinical considerations </plain></SENT>
