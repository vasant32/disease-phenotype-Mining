<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In Asia, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> diagnosed through endoscopy has increased from 3-9% to 14-16% in the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EE) over a span of 10 years in a tertiary care facility in the Philippines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with EE from 1994 to 1997 (period A) and from 2000 to 2003 (period B) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The modified Savary-Miller and Los Angeles classifications were used to grade EE for periods A and B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 15 981 upper endoscopies were evaluated for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the male: female ratio (period A 1.43:1 vs period B 1.25:1, P = 0.459) and in the mean age of patients with EE (period A 46.4 vs period B 47.5, P = 0.395) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of EE was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.0001) in period B (6.3%) as compared to period A (2.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, despite a higher prevalence, more patients had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in period B as compared to period A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, there were more patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcers</z:mp> (18.6%vs 5.9%, P &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> (2.3%vs 0%, P = 0.003), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (15.8%vs 7.5%, P = 0.001) in period A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was not significantly different between the two time periods (period A 3.2%vs period B 5%, P = 0.367) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of EE was higher in 2000-2003 than in 1994-1997, although the complications associated with the disease diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> remained stable </plain></SENT>
