<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecular events responsible for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_85'>transdifferentiation</z:mpath> of epithelial cells of the esophagus to a columnar cell type are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cdx2 has been detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, so we sought evidence of Cdx2 expression during the process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_85'>transdifferentiation</z:mpath> of the esophageal squamous epithelium into a glandular phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two rats underwent an esophago-jejunostomy to produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> of 20, 25, 30, or 35 weeks of duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of esophageal lesions induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux was examined for expression of Cdx2 and Muc2 by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five animals developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_165'>glandular metaplasia</z:mpath> and adenosquamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, two developed only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_165'>glandular metaplasia</z:mpath>, and two had adenosquamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear Cdx2 expression was detected in 57% (four of seven) and 43% (three of seven) of foci of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_165'>glandular metaplasia</z:mpath> and adenosquamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cdx2 staining was detectable in some squamous and some mucus secreting cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perinuclear and perivacuolar staining of Muc2 was detected focally in 71% (five of seven) and 57% (four of seven) of areas with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_165'>glandular metaplasia</z:mpath> and adenosquamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We show that duodenal-content reflux into the esophagus switches on the expression of Cdx2 protein in esophageal keratinocytic cells, promoting a mucinous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_85'>transdifferentiation</z:mpath> process with secretion of intestinal mucin Muc2 </plain></SENT>
