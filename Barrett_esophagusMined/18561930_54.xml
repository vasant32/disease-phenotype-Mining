<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), life-long surveillance endoscopy is recommended because of an elevated risk for developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various endoscopic therapies have been used to eradicate BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently circumferential radiofrequency ablation has been used with encouraging short-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To provide longer follow-up and to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of step-wise circumferential ablation with the addition of focal ablation for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter clinical trial (NCT00489268) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Eight U.S. centers, between May 2004 and February 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Seventy subjects with 2 to 6 cm of BE and histologic evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Circumferential ablation was performed at baseline and repeated at 4 months if there was residual IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up biopsy specimens were obtained at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specimens were reviewed by a central pathology board </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Focal ablation was performed after the 12-month follow-up for histological evidence of IM at the 12-month biopsy (absolute indication) or endoscopic appearance suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (relative indication) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subjects received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> for control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Complete absence of IM per patient from biopsy specimens obtained at 12 and 30 months, defined as complete remission-IM (CR-IM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 12 months, CR-IM was achieved in 48 of 69 available patients (70% per protocol [PP], 69% intention to treat [ITT]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At 30 months after additional focal ablative therapy, CR-IM was achieved in 60 of 61 available patients (98% PP, 97% ITT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no strictures or buried glandular mucosa detected by the standardized biopsy protocol at 12 or 30 months, and there were no serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This was an uncontrolled clinical trial with 2.5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stepwise circumferential and focal ablation resulted in complete eradication of IM in 98% of patients at 2.5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
