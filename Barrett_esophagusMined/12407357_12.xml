<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: When esophagocardiomyotomy (ECM) is performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo>, a complementary antireflux procedure of the surgeon's choice is usually performed to minimize postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective analysis describes patients after laparoscopic ECM, most of whom had a modified Dor fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1994 and 2001, 81 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> of the esophagus had laparoscopic ECM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously described the use of intraoperative endoscopy to verify completion of ECM in a cohort of 48 patients who had either Toupet fundoplication (n = 25) or floppy Dor fundoplication (n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since then floppy Dor fundoplication has been the preferred antireflux procedure for ease of performance and safety reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This article describes the floppy Dor fundoplication as we have performed it since 1997, anchoring the wrap to both crura of the hiatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the anterior gastric wall is sutured to the anterior rim of the esophageal hiatus, avoiding creation of the paraesophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> that occurs if the gastric wall abuts the entire the length of a long ECM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 1- to 70-month follow up period (mean 45 months), patients who were symptomatic were evaluated by radiographic, manometric, or endoscopic methods; pH studies were not done systematically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 70% of patients who could be evaluated had postoperative quality of life and symptom assessment interviews that revealed willingness to repeat the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall satisfaction was high (8.4/10 where 10 is perfect); moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was seen in 11 (16%) 3 to 16 months postoperatively, but patients reverted to a satisfaction score of 8.2 after endoscopic dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Occasional heartburn was present in 15 (26%) patients with regular, 5-use <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>), including 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Others use these medications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No patient has had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0152018" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the esophagus</z:e> develop, but endoscopic surveillance has been inconstant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Swallowing was improved in patients without sigmoid esophagus and overall satisfaction was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>New-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> heartburn is an unpredictable problem that can be treated in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> may be required at intervals after ECM-fundoplication for bridging <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> at the cardia, but has not required reoperation, as a rule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic ECM is an attractive operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
