<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study examined the correlation between the immunohistochemical expression of pRb2/p130, VEGF, EZH2, p53, p16, p21waf-1, p27, and PCNA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, p53 showed a much higher expression in BE patients (up to 50%) than in controls (1-10%) (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also p21 showed a downregulation in BE when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (70% of cells vs. 65%), but the difference did not show any statistical significance (P = 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>pRb2/p130 was detected in 80% of cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, but showed positive in only 20% of cells in BE biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, Rb2/p130 expression was inversely correlated to that of VEGF, EZH2, and PCNA (P &lt; 0.0001, P = 0.0032, P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p27 stained more intensely and in a widespread manner (70%) cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal tissues but about only 30% in BE samples (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lastly, in accordance with other reports, we also found p16 expressed by immunohistochemistry at high levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and at low levels in BE (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, p16, p21, p27, and p53 staining confirmed previously published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, pRb2/p130 expression was found significantly decreased in metaplastic epithelium compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and showed significant inverse correlation with the expression of other markers, such as VEGF, EZH2, and PCNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data, taken together, indicate that these molecular events occurring in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM) may represent one of the many steps taking place during esophageal malignant progression such as impairment of cell-cycle control, altered differentiation, and unbalanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
