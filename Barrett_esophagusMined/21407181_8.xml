<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Risk stratification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) using biomarkers remains an important goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated feasibility and clinical accuracy of novel microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers for prediction of BE <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paired fresh-frozen and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>/eosin specimens from a prospective tissue repository where only biopsies with the lesion of interest (i.e., <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD)/esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC)) occupying &gt;50% of biopsy area were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue miRNA expression was determined by microarrays and validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three groups were compared-group A, IM tissues from BE patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; group B, IM tissues from group C patients; and group C, dysplastic tissues from BE patients with HGD/EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 22 BE patients, 11 with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (mean age 64 ± 8.2 and 63 ± 11.6 years, respectively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Caucasian males) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine miRNAs were identified by high-throughout analysis (miR-15b, -21, -192, -205, 486-5p, -584, -1246, let-7a, and -7d) and qRT-PCR confirmed expression of miR-15b, -21, 486-5p, and let-7a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of 4 miRNAs (miR-145 and -203, but not -196a and -375) previously described in BE patients also exhibited differential expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of miRNAs for HGD/EAC were miR-15b: 87 and 80%, miR-21: 93 and 70%, miR-203: 87 and 90%, miR-486-5p: 82 and 55%, and miR-let-7a: 88 and 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MiRNA-15b, -21, and -203 exhibited field effects (i.e., groups A and B tissues while histologically similar yet exhibited different miRNA expression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates feasibility of miRNAs to discriminate BE patients with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with reasonable clinical accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the specific miRNAs need to be evaluated further in future prospective trials </plain></SENT>
