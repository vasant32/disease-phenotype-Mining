<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, anecdotal clinical experience suggested an increase in symptom perception in patients after successful elimination of Barrett's epithelium, using multipolar electrocoagulation (MPEC) and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine perception thresholds to acid infusion, we evaluated eight consecutive patients after a series of MPEC treatments resulted in complete elimination of Barrett's mucosa and compared them to 10 age-matched patients with nonreversed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and 10 patients with symptomatic, endoscopy-documented erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (Hetzel-Dent grade 2 or greater) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chemosensitivity was determined by a modified acid perfusion test, where acid perception thresholds were quantified by the lag time to initial typical symptom perception, sensory intensity rating, and an acid perfusion sensory score (APSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While patients after successful elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had similar sensory intensity ratings and APSS as patients with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, the lag times differed significantly between the groups, and both groups had significantly higher sensory intensity ratings and APSS than patients with nonreversed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients after complete reversal of Barrett's mucosa are unexpectedly as sensitive to acid as symptomatic patients with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
