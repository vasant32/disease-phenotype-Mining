<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The modern inhibitors of gastric acid secretion reduce very efficiently the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> but they appear to modify the pathophysiological situation in a way that favours the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the last two decades, the prevalence of BE in the population submitted to endoscopy has clearly increased while the peptic stricture of the esophagus is fast disappearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With a reduced tendency to stricture and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, the esophagus seems more prone to the columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the factor that promotes the columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> reaches the areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> through the esophageal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the conditions of an advanced reflux disease, the veins crossing the gastroesophageal junction would be well suited to the transport of this factor, provided they have not been obliterated by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The veins do not normally participate in the metabolic activity but their permeability may be altered in a pathological environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the esophageal wall submitted to an important reflux, the environment cannot be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, as evidenced by the alterations of the esophageal motricity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these veins are submitted to the peristaltic activity of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
