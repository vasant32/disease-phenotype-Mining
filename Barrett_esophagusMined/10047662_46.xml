<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether the extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> is related to the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 556 consecutive patients with symptoms suggestive of foregut disease had upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with extensive biopsies from the gastroesophageal junction and the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had esophageal motility and 24-hour pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 411 patients, cardiac-type mucosa was identified; in 147 patients, the cardiac-type mucosa showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were divided into 3 groups based on the extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> commonly seen clinically: long segments (&gt;3 cm), short segments (&lt;3 cm), and limited to the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration of symptoms, the status of the lower esophageal sphincter, the degree of esophageal acid exposure, and the time to clear a reflux episode were assessed in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in cardiac-type mucosa was associated with the hallmarks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> correlated strongly with the degree of esophageal acid exposure (r = 0.711; P &lt;.001) and inversely with the lower esophageal sphincter pressure (r = 0.351; P &lt;.001) and length (r = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>259; P =.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with a long segment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (&gt;3 cm) had longer duration of symptoms (16 years) than those patients with a segment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> less than 3 cm (10 years; P =.048) or those patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> limited to the gastroesophageal junction (10 years; P =.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, that is, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, is related to the status of the lower esophageal sphincter and the degree of esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
