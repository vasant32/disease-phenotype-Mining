<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies suggest that cox-2 regulates expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2, thus possibly accounting for <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>reduced apoptosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of these 2 genes in the development of Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologic sections from endoscopic biopsies or esophagectomy specimens were classified as non-dysplastic Barrett's (n = 30), intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (n = 12) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The desired tissue was isolated by laser capture microdissection and expression levels of cox-2 and bcl-2 were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (Taqman) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene expression levels were compared to samples of the distal esophageal squamous epithelium (n = 55) and reflux-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n = 25), without Barrett's or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of both bcl-2 and cox-2 were increased in non-dysplastic Barrett's (p = 0.0077, p = 0.0037), intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (p = 0.0053, p = 0.0220) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.0001) compared to squamous epithelium or reflux-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is a significant correlation between these two genes, especially in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
