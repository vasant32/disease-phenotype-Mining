<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported four families with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (FBE) in 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This follow-up study includes an additional 16 families with FBE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) and BE-related <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BEAC) highlighting the familial trends of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective survey of endoscopic and histopathological reports on 95 confirmed cases of BE from 1975 to 2005 was performed and a detailed family history was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five representative pedigrees from a total of 20 are discussed here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These 20 families represent one of the largest cohorts studied over three decades from a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Familial BE is more common than previously thought and the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, BE and BEAC in these families is distinctly higher than with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conditions appear to be inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> fashion with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hence diligence in taking family history with BE patients is critical since the endoscopic screening of relatives is warranted in FBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Earlier diagnosis and surveillance of FBE should hopefully improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
