<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BM is considered as the main risk factor for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; BAc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> that control gene expression by targeting <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> and they are reportedly dysregulated in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that a specific miRNA expression signature characterizes BM development and progression, we performed miRNA microarray analysis comparing native esophageal mucosa with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the phenotypic lesions seen in the Barrett's carcinogenic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens were collected from 14 BE patients who had undergone esophagectomy, including: 14 with N, 14 with BM, 7 with low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, 5 with high-grade intra-epithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and 11 with BAc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microarray findings were further validated by quantitive real-time polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization analyses using a different series of consecutive cases (162 biopsy samples and 5 esophagectomies) of histologically proven, long-segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified a miRNA signature of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> consisting of an increased expression of 6 miRNAs and a reduced expression of 7 miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To further support these results, we investigated target gene expression using the Oncomine database and/or immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that target gene expression correlated significantly with miRNA dysregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specific miRNAs are directly involved in BE progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>miRNA profiling significantly expands current knowledge on the molecular history of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, also identifying molecular markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
