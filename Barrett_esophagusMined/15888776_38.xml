<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adequacy of acid suppression is a critical factor influencing healing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (GORD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The European prospective study ProGORD was set up to determine the endoscopic and symptomatic progression of GORD over five years under routine care, after initial acid suppression with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on factors influencing endoscopic healing and symptom resolution during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with symptoms suggestive of GORD underwent endoscopy and biopsies were obtained from the oesophagus for diagnosis of abnormalities, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data from 6215 patients were included in the "intention to treat" analysis, 3245 diagnosed as having erosive reflux disease (ERD) and 2970 non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ERD patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg for 4-8 weeks for endoscopic healing while NERD patients received 20 mg for 2-4 weeks for resolution of heartburn symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopic healing occurred overall in 87.7% of ERD patients although healing was significantly lower in those with more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> (76.9%) and in those with BO (72.4%), particularly in Helicobacter pylori negative BO patients (70.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, and body mass index appeared to have no significant impact on healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete heartburn resolution was reported by 70.4% of ERD patients and by 64.8% of NERD patients at the last visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e> had a significant influence on complete heartburn resolution in the NERD group (68.1% and 63.7% for H pylori positive and H pylori negative, respectively; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of Barrett's mucosa, as well as severe mucosal damage, exerts a negative impact on healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e> had a positive influence on healing in ERD patients with coexistent BO but no influence on those without BO </plain></SENT>
