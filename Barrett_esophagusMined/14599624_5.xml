<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is a recently described immune stimulant and hapten carrier derived from a circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> of the marine mollusk Megathura crenulata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that KLH has significant antiproliferative effects in vitro against breast, pancreas, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that KLH would be effective against Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in an in vitro model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines (SEG-1 and BIC-1) were cultured using standard techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells were plated at 1 x 10(5) and KLH was added at concentrations ranging from 400 ng to 100 microg/well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 and 72 h incubation, cells were assayed for viability using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was evaluated using a cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> detection kit after 16 hours of incubation with KLH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KLH treatment significantly (p &lt; 0.001) <z:mp ids='MP_0010831'>reduced viability</z:mp> in a dose and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was increased in treated SEG-1 cells, but no changes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were seen in treated BIC-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: KLH directly inhibits the growth of human Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in vitro by apoptotic and nonapoptotic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
