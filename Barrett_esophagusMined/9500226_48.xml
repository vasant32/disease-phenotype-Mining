<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of this, techniques are being explored for the eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and histopathologists will increasingly be required to assess response to these therapies in esophageal biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histopathologic features before and after treatment were studied in biopsy samples from 16 patients receiving <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> only, 10 treated by KTP laser photoablation, and five who underwent photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the treatment modalities resulted in histologic changes with at least partial squamous reepithelialization of the metaplastic columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histologic findings suggest three main mechanisms for this: encroachment of adjacent squamous epithelium at the squamocolumnar junction, extension of epithelium from the submucosal gland duct to form squamous islands, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_171'>squamous metaplasia</z:mpath> within the Barrett's columnar mucosa itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter mechanism implies the existence of pluripotential stem cells within Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A relatively common finding was residual glandular mucosa, nonneoplastic and dysplastic, beneath squamous epithelium indicating the requirement for histologic confirmation of endoscopically suspected complete squamous reepithelialization with sufficiently deep biopsies </plain></SENT>
