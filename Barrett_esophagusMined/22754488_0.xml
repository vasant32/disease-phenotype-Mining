<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) is a novel imaging technique which utilizes a low-power laser light passed through a fiber-optic bundle, within a miniprobe that is advanced into the working channel, to obtain microscopic images of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This allows the endoscopist to evaluate the microarchitecture of the gastrointestinal epithelium in real time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At this time pCLE cannot replace histopathology, but it can provide diagnostic information as well as guide therapeutic management in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a retrospective case series in which four patients with BE and biopsy-proven HGD underwent endoscopy with pCLE to direct real-time endoscopic ablation therapy and/or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), which was performed in conjunction with pCLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients had pCLE showing features of HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After either EMR or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), pCLE was again used to evaluate the margins after therapy to assure accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case, pCLE had features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at the margin and further repeat EMR was immediately performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another case had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing esophagus, but pCLE found features of BE in discrete areas and targeted biopsies were performed, which confirmed BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This patient subsequently underwent RFA therapy of the residual areas of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in patients with BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, pCLE is an effective tool used to target biopsies, guide endoscopic therapy and assess the accuracy of EMR or RFA </plain></SENT>
