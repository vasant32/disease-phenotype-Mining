<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy using porfimer <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> can result in ablation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and restitution of squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the effect of photodynamic therapy on cyclooxygenase-2 expression in esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paired pre- and post-photodynamic therapy biopsy samples from the same anatomical levels of 20 individuals who had undergone photodynamic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and/or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were immunostained using a cyclooxygenase-2 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase-2 expression was graded in squamous epithelium, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (if present) as follows: grade 0 (no staining), grade 1 (staining in 1-10% of cells), grade 2 (staining in 11-90% of cells), and grade 3 (staining in &gt;90% of cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-photodynamic therapy median cyclooxygenase-2 expression was grade 2 (range 1-3) in neoplastic foci and grade 1 (range 1-3) in nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (P=0.0009 for pairwise comparison) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the exception of a few cells staining in the basal epithelial layers, median cyclooxygenase-2 expression was graded as 0 (similar to controls) in both pre-photodynamic therapy squamous epithelium and post-photodynamic therapy neosquamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was significantly lower when compared to either neoplastic foci (P&lt;0.0001) or nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.0001) pre-photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Notably, in four patients with post-photodynamic therapy recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, cyclooxygenase-2 expression returned to elevated levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase-2 expression is elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> prior to photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following successful photodynamic therapy, cyclooxygenase-2 expression in neosquamous epithelium returns to a low baseline level similar to that observed in native esophageal squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Post-photodynamic therapy neoplastic recurrence is associated with elevated cyclooxygenase-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies should determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35544">cyclooxygenase inhibitors</z:chebi> have a role as adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> following endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
