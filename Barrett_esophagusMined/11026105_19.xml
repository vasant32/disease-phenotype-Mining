<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to characterize expression and mutation of beta-catenin in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of beta-catenin was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue from 30 cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether there is a correlation between beta-catenin nuclear accumulation and exon 3 mutation of this gene, mutational analysis by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism was performed on DNA extracted from the same 30 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, the prevalence of reduced expression of beta-catenin on the membrane, with or without nuclear staining, increased significantly from low-grade (LG) to high-grade (HG) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal nuclear staining for beta-catenin was present in 19 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and nuclear staining was associated significantly with progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to LG <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in glands with clear histologic transition from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to LG <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was found only in the LG dysplastic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No mutation in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene was detected in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that disturbance of the APC/beta-catenin pathway, as indicated by nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, is a common and early event during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
