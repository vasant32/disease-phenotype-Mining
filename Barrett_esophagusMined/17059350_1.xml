<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, a precancerous lesion for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC) is very low in the northwest of the country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that esophageal AC would also be lower than in the Western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the clinicopathologic characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in comparison the data from western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This mixed (prospective-retrospective) study enrolled 350 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> (216 endoscopically and pathologically documented, including 134 surgically proven cases) from May 2000 to May 2006, in our referral center in Tabriz, in the northwest of Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We localized the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in esophagus and esophago-gastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type III gastric cardial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 61+/-12.36 (min 16, max 83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The male to female ratio was almost equal (51.7% vs 48.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lower third of the esophagus was involved in 62% of the patients and esophageal ACs accounted for 18.9% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, distinct esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> was only seen in two and in the remainder gastric cardia was also involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> was more frequent in females, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in males (x 2=8.89, df=2, p=0.012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among 134 operated cases, resection was feasible in 74.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this Iranian population, the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is very much lower than in Western countries </plain></SENT>
