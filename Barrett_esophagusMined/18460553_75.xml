<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic therapy is increasingly being used in the treatment of high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) and mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BC) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report provides 5 year follow-up data from a large prospective study investigating the efficacy and safety of endoscopic treatment in these patients and analysing risk factors for recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic tertiary care centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Between October 1996 and September 2002, 61 patients with HGIN and 288 with BC were included (173 with short-segment and 176 with long-segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>) from a total of 486 patients presenting with Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with submucosal or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of complete remission and recurrence rate, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopic resection was performed in 279 patients, photodynamic therapy in 55, and both procedures in 13; two patients received <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 63.6 (SD 23.1) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete response (CR) was achieved in 337 patients (96.6%); surgery was necessary in 13 (3.7%) after endoscopic therapy failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Metachronous lesions developed during the follow-up in 74 patients (21.5%); 56 died of concomitant disease, but none died of BC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The calculated 5 year survival rate was 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The risk factors most frequently associated with recurrence were piecemeal resection, long-segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, no ablative therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> after CR, time until CR achieved &gt;10 months and multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that endoscopic therapy was highly effective and safe, with an excellent long-term survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The risk factors identified may help stratify patients who are at risk for recurrence and those requiring more intensified follow-up </plain></SENT>
