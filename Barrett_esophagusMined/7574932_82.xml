<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The author's goal was to determine the role of duodenal components in the development of complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND DATA: There is a disturbing increase in the prevalence of complications, specifically the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Earlier studies using pH monitoring and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> techniques have shown that increased esophageal exposure to fluid with a pH above 7, that is, of potential duodenal origin, may be an important factor in this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The presence of duodenal content in the esophagus was studied in 53 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> confirmed by 24-hour pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A portable spectrophotometer (Bilitec 2000, Synectics, Inc.) with a fiberoptic probe was used to measure intraluminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> as a marker for duodenal juice in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> values for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring were established for 25 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of 22 patients, a custom-made program was used to correlate simultaneous pH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> absorbance readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-eight percent of patients were found to have increased esophageal exposure to gastric and duodenal juices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of mucosal damage increased when duodenal juice was refluxed into the esophagus, in that patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (n = 27) had a significantly higher prevalence of abnormal esophageal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> exposure than did those with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n = 10) or with no injury (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also had a greater esophageal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> exposure compared with patients without Barrett's changes, with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correlation of pH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring showed that the majority (87%) of esophageal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> exposure occurred when the pH of the esophagus was between 4 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reflux of duodenal juice in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> is more common than pH studies alone would suggest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The combined reflux of gastric and duodenal juices causes severe esophageal mucosal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e> occurs at a pH range of 4 to 7, at which <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi>, the major component of duodenal juice, are capable of damaging the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
