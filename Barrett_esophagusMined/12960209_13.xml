<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We analysed the phenotypic features of 70 familial BO/OAC families accrued for the purpose of initiating a linkage study to search for genes that contribute to susceptibility for BO/OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Families with young or familial BO/OAC were recruited from participating institutions and self-referral from advertisement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 70 families (173 affected and 784 unaffected individuals) were recruited into this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean ages of diagnosis of BO and OAC among males were 50.6 and 57.4 years, respectively; among females, 52.1 and 63.5 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1707251" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers other</z:e> than OAC or oesophagogastric junctional <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OGJAC), among probands was 0.71 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy one percent of the pedigrees have "typical" structures with less than three affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Power calculations under realistic model assumptions suggest that if <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> is absent or limited, then DNA collection from members of these pedigrees could enable the identification of a novel candidate susceptibility gene for BO/OAC in a genome scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest series of families with BO/OAC yet reported, features of which are consistent with inherited germline predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, the SIR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1707251" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers other</z:e> than OAC/OGJAC was 0.71 among 70 probands, indicating these individuals were not more likely to develop non-OAC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
