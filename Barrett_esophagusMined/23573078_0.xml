<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on histomorphological findings, detailed screening and therapeutic guidelines have been elaborated, although epidemiological studies could not support the postulated increasing progression rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> to BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, proposed predictive and prognostic markers are rather <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> by nature, lack substantial proofs, and currently do not allow stratification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients for progression, outcome, and therapeutic effectiveness in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper is to discuss the current knowledge regarding the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-BE-EAC sequence mainly focusing on the disputable and ambiguous status of proposed biomarkers to identify promising and reliable markers in order to provide more detailed insights into pathophysiological mechanisms and thus to improve prognostic and predictive therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
