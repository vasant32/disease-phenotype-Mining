<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies suggest a reduced risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in populations with a high consumption of fish, and n-3 fatty acids inhibit experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation is the suppression of eicosanoid production through inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the effects of dietary supplementation with the n-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) on a number of biological endpoints in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Fifty-two participants with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples were obtained from a recorded level within the area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and then 27 patients were randomly assigned to consume <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> capsules (1.5 g/d) for 6 mo or no supplement (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of this period, patients again underwent endoscopy, and biopsy samples were collected at the same level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples were analyzed for mucosal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi>, COX-2 protein, and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cellular proliferation was also measured, by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> content of esophageal mucosa increased over the study period in the n-3-supplemented subjects and was significantly different from the content in the controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant decline in COX-2 protein concentrations (measured by immunoblotting) in the n-3 group, and the difference was significant from that in the controls (P &lt; 0.05); no difference in COX-2 RNA concentrations was observed between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This change in COX-2 protein was inversely related to the change in <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> content (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the change in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi>, or cellular proliferation between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Supplementation with <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> significantly changed n-3 fatty acid concentrations and reduced COX-2 concentrations in Barrett's tissue </plain></SENT>
