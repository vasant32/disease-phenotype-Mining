<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, reliable markers predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only clinically useful risk factor is the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's epithelium, but its use as a prognostic marker of disease progression has several significant limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, identification of biomarkers of potential prognostic value in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> development in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is highly important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine if expression levels of selected genes support histologic diagnosis of dysplastic changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon rigorous sampling and independent histopathologic examination of endoscopic specimens by two experienced gastrointestinal pathologists, 56 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (16 negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 15 with indefinite, 21 with low-grade, and 4 with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) were selected for molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of ten selected genes were estimated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although expression of nine genes showed trends toward down- or upregulation during progression from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, only a decrease in S100A2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was considerable variation among individuals and significant overlapping of ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, detailed, comparative analysis of serial samples from Barrett's mucosa and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium shows large intra-individual variability of gene expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, expression of this set of ten genes cannot be used as a molecular marker aiding histological examination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant inter- and intra-patient variations of gene expression levels makes use of the selected genes impractical </plain></SENT>
