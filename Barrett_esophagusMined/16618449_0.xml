<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason a cross-sectional study was done in order to assess reflux disease in Billroth resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coincidental pathology (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a period of 12 years, 370 consecutive patients with a partial gastrectomy were seen (268 Billroth II, 102 Billroth I) and three groups of patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 1 included 64 patients (17%) with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>; group 2, 16 patients (4%) with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>; and group 3, 290 patients (78%) with only a Billroth resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reflux disease occurred significantly more often in men than in women (7.5% vs. 2%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in type of resection or in the presence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> (only one <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Only a minority of patients with partial gastrectomy has signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in the long term </plain></SENT>
