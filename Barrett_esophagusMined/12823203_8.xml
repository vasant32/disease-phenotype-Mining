<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to improve the efficacy of endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in addition to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess TP53 mutational analysis as a method of identifying patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who are at greatest risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, for whom endoscopic surveillance is most appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutational analysis was initially performed on premalignant and malignant tissue from 30 patients undergoing esophagectomy for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and on premalignant biopsies from 48 patients participating in a Barrett's surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surveillance patients were followed up endoscopically and histologically for a median of 5 years following TP53 assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis was performed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutations were detected in 10 of 30 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, and were more common in well-differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An identical TP53 mutation was detected in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients with premalignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had TP53 mutations and one of these patients developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> on follow up whilst the other has not yet progressed beyond <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient without TP53 mutation developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutations are detected in 33% of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and in 4% of premalignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in patients undergoing endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutation can be detected before the development of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and may be useful in stratifying the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
