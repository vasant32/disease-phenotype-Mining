<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several epidemiological cohort studies have suggested that duodeno-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> per se induces <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> leading to increased risk of the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the exact causative factors behind EAC remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we designed a new duodenal contents reflux model which retained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stomach function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this model, duodenal contents flowed back into the esophagus and stomach resulting in repeated re-entry into the esophagus through the site of esophagojejunostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the factors underlying the development of EAC, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35622,50120">thiazolidine</z:chebi>-4-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33575">carboxylic acid</z:chebi> (thioproline, TPRO) was applied to the new reflux models as a <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> scavenger and as a probe to detect reactive nitrogen species (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33697">RNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-operatively, 31 animals were divided into two groups according to diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals belonging to the control group were given <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet (n = 18), while the TPRO group was given food containing 0.5% TPRO (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> esophageal sections in both groups were examined using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining and immunohistochemical analysis of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EACs developed in 7 of 18 rats (38.9%) of the control group, whereas no EACs were detected in the TPRO group (Fisher's exact test, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) was detected in 1 of 18 rats (5.6%) of the control group and in 1 of 13 rats (7.7%) of the TPRO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.671) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>iNOS protein was overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33697">RNS</z:chebi> such as nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35800">nitroso compounds</z:chebi> derived from reflux of duodenal contents play an important role in the development of EAC, and that the primary causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> and EAC may differ </plain></SENT>
