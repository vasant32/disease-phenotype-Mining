<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a metaplastic condition in which the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stratified squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our group has previously characterized a unique surface cell (the "distinctive cell") at the junction of squamous and Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cell is notable for the simultaneous presence on its surface of both squamous and columnar cell features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of our present study were, first, to evaluate prospectively the frequency with which Barrett's patients have the distinctive cell at the squamo-Barrett's junction; second, to further elucidate the characteristics of the distinctive cell; and third, to perform a combined morphological study of the squamo-Barrett's junction using scanning electron microscopy followed by transmission and light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We divided study patients into two groups: Group I consisted of Barrett's patients and group II of non-Barrett's control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of eight group I Barrett's patients with junctional biopsies, three were noted to have the distinctive cell (37.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, this cell was not observed in any of the group II control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopsies in control patients as well as Barrett's patients without the distinctive cell revealed abrupt squamogastric or squamo-Barrett's junctions by scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, biopsies from the Barrett's patients with the distinctive cell revealed junctions that were not abrupt and had the distinctive cells overlying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By scanning electron microscopy, the distinctive cells were flattened, polygonal cells with surface microvilli (a columnar cell feature) and were demarcated from one another by shallow <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo>, or by intercellular ridges (a squamous cell feature) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By transmission electron microscopy, the distinctive cells were cuboidal in shape with abundant apical microvilli and secretory vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We have confirmed that distinctive cells are present in some Barrett's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This cell is a morphologic hybrid, sharing features of both squamous and columnar cells, and may be analogous to hybrid cells identified in other locations that undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (eg, the human cervix) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Its origin may be the result of transformation of multipotential basal cells of squamous epithelial origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the distinctive cells may represent an intermediate stage in the development of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
