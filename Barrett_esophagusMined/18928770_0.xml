<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A new catheter-free outpatient oesophageal pH-meter system (Bravo) has recently been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to test the tolerance, safety and efficacy of the system in the measurement of gastric-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">oesophageal reflux</z:e> by comparing it with a conventional pH system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: The study was performed on a control group consisting of 10 healthy volunteers (group 1) and in a group of 40 patients with symptoms of gastric-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">oesophageal reflux</z:e> disease (groups 2 and 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An upper digestive system endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and oesophageal pH measurements with a conventional system and/or with the Bravo catheter-free system, was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who had both tests done (groups 1 and 2) filled in a questionnaire on any physical problems and changes in their daily activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The test tolerance was higher with the Bravo system in the 9 parameters studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group of healthy volunteers (group 1), the median (range) of the total percentage of pH &lt; 4 was 1.1% (0.5-3.1) with the conventional pH and 1.7% (0-3.4) with the Bravo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When comparing the patients with symptoms of gastric-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">oesophageal reflux</z:e> disease (group 2) with those who had only one type of pH measurement made, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> was significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> than in the rest of the groups, with conventional pH as well as with the Bravo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If we analyse the patient group with disease due to gastric-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">oesophageal reflux</z:e> with those on whom both techniques were used (group 3), 7 of the 10 patients had a pathological reflux that only showed up on measuring pH with the Bravo system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Catheter-free pH measurements (Bravo) is better tolerated and with better satisfaction for the healthy volunteers and patients than with conventional PH, even, on occasions being more efficient for studying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> due to the lower incidence of negative results </plain></SENT>
