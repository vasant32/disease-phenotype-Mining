<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of a putative intestinal stem cell marker LgR5 was analyzed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> specimen (n = 70: 41 EAC with BE, 19 EAC without BE, and n = 10 esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinomas</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) and in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line OE-33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 and Cdx-2 were co-labelled with LgR5 in double staining experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical expression results were confirmed by RT-PCR and correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and five-year survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LgR5was found expressed in 35 of 41 (85%) EAC with BE and in 16 of 19 (81%) EAC without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, LgR5 was not found to be expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantification of immunolabeling showed 15% LgR5+ cells in EAC with BE, 32% LgR5+ cells in adjacent BE and 13% in EAC without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence double staining experiments with LgR5 and Ki-67 revealed a subpopulation (~5%) of proliferating LgR+/Ki-67+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-level, expression of LgR5 was higher in BE in comparison to EAC (p = 0.0159) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High levels of LgR5 expression in BE associated EAC were associated with poorer survival in univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The stem cell marker LgR5 is expressed in EAC, irrespective of association with BE, and appears to have negative impact on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The subset of proliferating LgR5+ cells (&lt;5%) might resemble rapidly cycling <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>, which needs to be substantiated in further investigations </plain></SENT>
