<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Actually the only surveillance method after the ablation treatment is random biopsies throughout the whole treated area </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The technology has garnered increasing attention because of its ability to provide real-time "optical" biopsy specimens, with a very high sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
