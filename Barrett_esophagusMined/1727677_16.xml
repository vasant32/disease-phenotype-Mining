<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prompted the authors to review their experience with endoscopic cytologic brushings and biopsies from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed 65 consecutive specimens from 42 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in which both the concurrently obtained esophageal cytologic brushings and companion biopsy specimens were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, esophagogastrectomy specimens from 9 nine these patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytologic and histologic specimens were assigned to one of four diagnostic categories, based on specifically defined criteria: simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with or without inflammatory atypia; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; or suspicious for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 38 cytologic brushings and 44 biopsy specimens, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 4 brushings and 7 biopsy specimens, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 14 brushings and 10 biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine brushings and three biopsy specimens were suspicious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 13 cases, brushings revealed a higher grade lesion than did histology; in 5 cases, biopsy specimens showed a higher grade lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Agreement between the two occurred in 72% (47/65) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accuracy was confirmed in the histologic examinations of the resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that specific criteria, when consistently applied, allow accurate cytologic diagnoses of epithelial changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of esophageal brush cytology and biopsy specimens provides two complementary techniques, which detect a greater number of serious lesions than either technique alone </plain></SENT>
