<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Of 46 patients who had Nissen fundoplication for proved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e>, 25 were available for follow up after a median of 20 years, 15 had died of unrelated causes, and six could not be traced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 25 patients in the follow up study were personally interviewed: 21 consented to an endoscopy, 14 to 24 hour recording of oesophageal pH and manometry, and 15 to radionuclide transit test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeat fundoplication for recurrent reflux was performed in two cases during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heartburn and regurgitation were significantly lessened (p &lt; 0.005), but the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was slightly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy showed six of 21 fundic wraps to be defective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267055" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Erosive oesophagitis</z:e> was seen in two patients, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (histologically confirmed) in one of them and six other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total reflux time was abnormal in four of 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient with an intact fundic wrap seen on endoscopy, only two of seven with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, and one of four with abnormal reflux had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fundoplication in itself did not affect oesophageal motility or transit, provided that the wrap was intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that Nissen fundoplication gave a reasonably good longterm effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux disease, with the stage of the fundic wrap as the main determinant of outcome </plain></SENT>
