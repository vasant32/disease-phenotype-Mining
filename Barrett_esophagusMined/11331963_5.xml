<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the etiology and pathogenesis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in short- (SSBE) and long- (LSBE) segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> have not been studied in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to clarify clinicopathologic and genetic differences between high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in SSBE versus LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the clinicopathologic features from 47 patients (19 SSBE [&lt;3 cm] and 28 LSBE [&gt; or =3 cm]) with esophagectomy for HGD/T1 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allelic losses on chromosomes 3p (FIHT), 5q (APC), 9p (p16), and 17p (p53) were compared in 12 HGD and 9 T1 tumors from 19 cases of SSBE and in 23 HGD and 15 T1 tumors from 28 cases of LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with SSBE were more likely to be smokers than were patients with LSBE (94.7% v 57.1%; P =.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HGD or T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> arising from SSBE were less likely to show adjoining nondysplastic Barrett mucosa than those from LSBE (73.6% v 100%; P =.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LSBE more frequently showed a circumferential pattern of Barrett mucosa than did SSBE (96.4% v 47.3%; P =.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal allelic losses on 3p, 5q, 9p, and 17p were detected in 19% (4 of 21), 43% (15 of 35), 40% (14 of 35), and 48% (16 of 33) of HGD, respectively, and 26% (5 of 19), 35% (8 of 23), 35% (8 of 23), and 57% (13 of 23) of T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in allelic loss of 3p, 5q, 9p, or 17p in HGD or T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from SSBE versus LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that both HGD and early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in SSBE and LSBE may occur through similar genetic alterations, whereas there are some clinicopathologic differences between SSBE and LSBE </plain></SENT>
