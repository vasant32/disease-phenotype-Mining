<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray (SNP-chip) analysis is a novel, precise, high-throughput approach to examine genomic alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using 250K SNP-chips, we examined the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> of BE to EAC, studying 11 matched sample sets: 6 sets of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (NE), BE and EAC, 4 of NE and BE and 1 of NE and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six (60%) of 10 total BE samples and 4 (57%) of 7 total EAC samples exhibited 1 or more genomic abnormalities comprising deletions, duplications, amplifications and copy-number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several shared abnormalities were identified, including chromosome 9p CNN-LOH [2 BE samples (20%)], deletion of CDKN2A [4 BE samples (40%)] and amplification of 17q12-21.2 involving the ERBB2, RARA and TOP2A genes [3.1 Mb, 2 EAC (29%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 1 BE sample contained a homozygous deletion spanning 9p22.3-p22.2 (1.2 Mb): this region harbors only 1 known gene, basonuclin 2 (BNC2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR analysis confirmed the deletion of this gene and decreased the expression of BNC2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the BE sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, transfection and stable expression of BNC2 caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> of OE33 EAC cells, suggesting that BNC2 functions as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene in the esophagus and that deletion of this gene occurs during the development of EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, this SNP-chip analysis has identified several early cytogenetic events and novel candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes that are potentially involved in the evolution of BE to EAC </plain></SENT>
