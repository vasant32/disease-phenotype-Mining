<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a pre-malignant condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surveillance endoscopy (SE) is recommended in order to detect and treat high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> early and prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SE has not been shown to have mortality benefit and several studies have questioned its cost-effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most gastroenterology practices do not have a surveillance program for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The few that exist are only in very specialized and funded programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Little information exists on outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> outside of these well-structured surveillance programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>STUDY: A retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosed and surveyed between 1995 and 2005 at a Veterans Affairs medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on age, body mass index, and race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who missed their SE by 6 months or more and those that missed their SE by twice the recommended intervals or more were identified and analyzed for changes in pathologic grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 472 patients were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or had SE between 1995 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and five patients only had one endoscopy and biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They did not have follow-up surveillance endoscopies and biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients were excluded from the final analysis: one had an esophagectomy after an index diagnosis of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and one had a diagnosis of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> 2 days after an initial impression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were 165 patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> who had SE more than once and were included in the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Overall, 53.3% had no change in pathologic grade, 35.2% regressed to a lower pathologic grade, and 11.5% progressed to a higher grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>None (0/165, 0%) progressed to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; 3.6% (6/165) progressed to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 11.5% (19/165) regressed to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients missed their SE by 6 months or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Of these, 50% regressed, 40.9% had no change, and 9.1% progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Four patients regressed to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, one progressed to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and none progressed to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients missed their SE by twice the recommended intervals or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Of these, 60.9% regressed, 34.8% did not change, and 4.3% progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>None progressed to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> but three regressed to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age and body mass index, patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> are nearly seven times more likely to miss their endoscopy by twice the recommended intervals or more (OR 6.56, P-value 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most veteran patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> do not undergo surveillance endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Veteran patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> undergoing SE rarely progress to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Veteran patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who have longer SE up to twice the recommended intervals because they missed their scheduled SE did not have a worse outcome when compared to the general <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> surveillance group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Veteran patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> are most likely to miss their SE by twice the recommended intervals or more, though the reason for this is unknown </plain></SENT>
