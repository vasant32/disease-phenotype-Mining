<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1990 to 1996, ambulatory esophageal manometry and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring were performed on 101 patients with different functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal diseases</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> 54 patients non-cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (10) and post-cholecystectomy (37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Esophageal motility studies were made to compare the effects of different anti-reflux therapies, to identify primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal motility disorders</z:e>, to assess the effect of anti-acid drugs, and to study the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal motility disorder</z:e> and other non-esophageal origin disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this study, anti-reflux surgery was better than medical therapy in controlling <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal manometry was the best method for detecting primary esophageal motility disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">Omeprazole</z:chebi> was superior to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> in terms of control of GER and reduction of gastric acidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cholecystectomy resulted in GER and many symptoms after surgery appeared to have an esophageal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal manometry and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring are the most sensitive and specialized methods for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal motility disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They are superior to other routine diagnostic methods such as radiology and endoscopy </plain></SENT>
