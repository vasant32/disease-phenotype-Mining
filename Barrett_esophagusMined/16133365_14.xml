<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies suggested that changes in claudin pattern have a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to detect alterations in CLDN 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 expression patterns in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (ACC) compared with that in foveolar epithelium (FOV), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium (SQ), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (SQCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty five surgically or endoscopically removed, paraffin-embedded cases were studied by immunohistochemistry and analyzed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BE, ACC, and FOV were dissected from 30 paraffin-embedded samples for further <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CLDN 7 was the dominating type in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> epithelia and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, but its expression did not differ in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and altered tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CLDN 1 expression was significantly increased in SQCC compared with that in SQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CLDNs 3 and 4 were significantly elevated both in BE and ACC compared with that in FOV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CLDN 2 expression increased significantly in ACCs compared with that in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report proving similarities and differences regarding claudin expression pattern in BE and ACC compared with that in FOV and SQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data prove a close link in CLDN pattern between BE and ACC, adding further evidence that BE is an alteration preceding esophageal ACC </plain></SENT>
