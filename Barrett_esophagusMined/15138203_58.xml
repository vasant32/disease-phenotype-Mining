<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">5-aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> induced photodynamic therapy (ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) with respect to complete reversal of BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with BO (32 no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and eight low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) were randomised to one of three treatments: (a) ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> as a single dose of 100 J/cm(2) at four hours (PDT100; n = 13); (b) ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> as a fractionated dose of 20 and 100 J/cm(2) at one and four hours, respectively (PDT20+100; n = 13); or (c) APC at a power setting of 65 W in two sessions (APC; n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If complete elimination of BO was not achieved by the designated treatment, the remaining BO was treated by a maximum of two sessions of APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean endoscopic reduction of BO at six weeks was 51% (range 20-100%) in the PDT100 group, 86% (range 0-100%) in the PDT20+100 group, and 93% (range 40-100%) in the APC group (PDT100 v PDT20+100, p&lt;0.005; PDT100 v APC, p&lt;0.005; and PDT20+100 v APC, NS) with histologically complete ablation in 1/13 (8%) patients in the PDT100 group, 4/12 (33%) in the PDT20+100 group, and 5/14 (36%) in the APC group (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remaining BO was additionally treated with APC in 23/40 (58%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological examination at 12 months revealed complete ablation in 9/11 (82%) patients in the PDT100 group, in 9/10 (90%) patients in the PDT20+100 group, and in 8/12 (67%) patients in the APC group (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Side effects (that is, pain (p&lt;0.01), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.05)) and elevated liver transaminases (p&lt;0.01) were more common after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> than APC therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died three days after treatment with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, presumably from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: APC alone or ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in combination with APC can lead to complete reversal of Barrett's epithelium in at least two thirds of patients when administered in multiple treatment sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As the goal of treatment should be complete reversal of Barrett's epithelium, we do not recommend these techniques for the prophylactic ablation of BO </plain></SENT>
