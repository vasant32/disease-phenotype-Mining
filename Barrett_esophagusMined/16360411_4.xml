<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate, in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence, the role of survivin, an inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>; the p53 protein, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene involved in cell cycle control; and caspase 3, a protease-inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and inhibited by survivin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical expression was tested in 40 cases of BE, including 11 low-grade and 19 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> (HGD), and samples were obtained from 40 surgical specimens of esophagectomy performed for HGD or Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To define the deregulation time of the proteins, overexpression was evaluated in relation to the proliferative and/or maturative compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In BE, cytoplasmic expression of survivin and caspase 3 (100% of cases) was significantly higher than expression of p53 (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter increased with increasing grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In BE, the expression of survivin, p53, and caspase 3 mainly involved the proliferative compartment, whereas in LGD and HGD, the 3 proteins were coexpressed in both proliferative and maturative compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that survivin overexpression is an early event in the proliferative compartment of BE, preceding both p53 accumulation and dysplastic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic survivin location may indicate an initial antiapoptotic, more than proliferative, role in the early phases of Barrett <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of caspase 3 in BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> may be ascribed to accumulation of the nonactivated form, as the antibody used detects both cleaved and uncleaved caspase 3 </plain></SENT>
