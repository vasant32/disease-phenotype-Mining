<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous cell line (EPC2) and metaplastic (CP-A) as well as dysplastic (CP-D) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> columnar cell lines are studied as a model of pre-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in the human esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the combination of an atomic force microscope (AFM) with a scanning confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope to study the mechanical properties of single adherent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty four force indentation curves were taken over the nucleus of each cell in an 8 x 8 grid pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyzing the force indentation curves, indentation depth-dependent Young's moduli were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stiffness tomograms demonstrate distinct differences between the mechanical properties of the studied cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing the stiffness for indentation forces of 1 nN, most probable Young's moduli were calculated to 4.7 kPa for EPC2 (n = 18 cells), 3.1 kPa for CP-A (n = 10) and 2.6 kPa for CP-D (n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also tested the influence of nuclei and nucleoli staining organic dyes on the mechanical properties of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For stained EPC2 cells (n = 5), significant stiffening was found (9.9 kPa), while CP-A cells (n = 5) showed no clear trend (2.9 kPa) and a slight softening was observed (2.1 kPa) in the case of CP-D cells (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some force-indentation curves show non-monotonic discontinuities with segments of negative slope, resembling a sawtooth pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found the incidence of these 'breakthrough events' to be highest in the dysplastic CP-D cells, intermediate in the metaplastic CP-A cells and lowest in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EPC2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that the microscopic explanation for the increased compliance of cancerous and pre-cancerous cells may lie in their susceptibility to 'crumble and yield' rather than their ability to 'bend and flex' </plain></SENT>
