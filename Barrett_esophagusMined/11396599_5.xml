<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, the precursor to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus and the stomach like mucosa is proximally displaced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently it can be detected only by an expensive upper GI endoscopic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a minimally invasive and easy to operate colorimetric instrument for the low-cost detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The instrument is based on a flexible, narrow diameter, fiber-optic probe that performs a colorimetric scan of the esophageal lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The instrument was clinically evaluated in 50 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The instrument could identify both symmetric and asymmetric SCJ's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SCJ locations determined by the colorimetric instrument correlated strongly (R2 = 0.89) with those determined by endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The instrument identified the SCJ locations accurately (Mean of difference +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>: 0.97 +/- 1.72 cm) and reproducibly (Mean of absolute difference +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>: 1.33 +/- 1.40 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The instrument has a 90% sensitivity of identifying patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, based on the clinical algorithm that if the SCJ is located at a distance less than 37 cm from the teeth, then the subject has <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, otherwise the subject does not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the colorimetric instrument has the potential of being a cost-effective way of determining patients likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in the population </plain></SENT>
