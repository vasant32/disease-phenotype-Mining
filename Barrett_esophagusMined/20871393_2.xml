<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study provides a method to develop a histologic definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> based on biopsies obtained from the affected esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathology reports from 1655 patients who had upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy according to a systematic protocol were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were obtained from the esophagus, around the gastroesophageal junction and the stomach: proximal, body, and antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had oxyntocardiac±cardiac±intestinal epithelia between the squamous epithelium proximally and the proximal limit of gastric oxyntic mucosa distally were defined as having a squamo-oxyntic gap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The length of the squamo-oxyntic gap varied from less than 1 cm in 1399 (84.5%) patients to greater than 5 cm in 80 (4.8%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only oxyntocardiac epithelium was seen in 190 (11.5%) of the patients, oxyntocardiac and cardiac epithelia in 898 (54.3%), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in addition to the other 2 epithelial types in 567 (34.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was directly proportional to length of the squamo-oxyntic gap, being 24.3% (340/1399) when the length was &lt;1 cm, and 83.5% (147/176) with length 1 to 5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a length more than 5 cm had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the 3 epithelia was constant irrespective of the length of the squamocolumnar gap; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, when present, was seen maximally in the proximal region of the gap, cardiac epithelium intermediate and oxyntocardiac epithelium in the most distal segment of the gap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The squamo-oxyntic gap started in a dilated region distal to the end of the tubular esophagus and distal to the proximal limit of the rugal folds and extended into the tubular esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Distal gastric biopsies showed no evidence of significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> in 1543 (93.2%) of the patients, indicating that the squamo-oxyntic gap was largely independent of gastric pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that the squamo-oxyntic gap is equivalent to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Its presence is a specific and sensitive indicator of reflux and can be used as a cellular criterion to define <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The length of the squamo-oxyntic gap provides an accurate assessment of the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The distal limit of the squamo-oxyntic gap, which is the junction between oxyntocardiac and gastric oxyntic epithelium is the true gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> within the squamo-oxyntic gap is the most accurate risk indicator for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and defines <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
