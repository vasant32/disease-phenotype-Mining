<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the effect of acid and/or bile on mucosal injury and esophageal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 1993-2004, 402 patients with reflux symptoms had 24-hour pH and Bilitec monitoring, manometry, and endoscopy with biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mucosal injury (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) and esophageal function (lower esophageal sphincter [LES] characteristics and body contractility) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e>, or both were compared with patients without reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reflux was present in 273/402 patients; of these, 37 (13.5%) had increased exposure to bile, 82 (30.0%) had increased exposure to acid, and 154 (56.4%) had increased exposure to both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mucosal injury was most common with increased mixed acid and bile exposure, followed by acid alone, and was uncommon with bile alone (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional deterioration paralleled mucosal injury (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mixed acid and bile exposure was present in more than half of patients with reflux and was associated with the most severe mucosal injury and the greatest deterioration of esophageal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that composition of gastric juice is the primary determinant of inflammatory mucosal injury and subsequent loss of esophageal function </plain></SENT>
