<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Currently, the American College of Gastroenterology requires identification of goblet cells in mucosal biopsies from the esophagus to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of goblet cells in mucosal biopsies is fraught with limitations such as sampling and interpretation error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One previous study by our group suggested that MUC2 expression in esophageal nongoblet columnar cells represents a late biochemical reaction in the conversion of mucinous columnar cells to goblet cells in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted this study to evaluate the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity of MUC2 positivity in nongoblet columnar epithelium for detection of goblet cells in the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also sought to identify associations between MUC2 positivity and clinical and endoscopic risk factors for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This analysis utilized mucosal biopsies of the distal esophagus or GEJ from 100 patients who participated in a community clinic-based study of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> evaluated prospectively in the western part of Washington state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We randomly selected 50 patients who had columnar epithelium with goblet cells, representing the study group and 50 patients without goblet cells, representing the comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for MUC2 was performed on samples in a blinded manner without knowledge of the clinical or endoscopic features of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of staining was noted in both goblet and nongoblet epithelium, both close to and distant from the mucosa with goblet cells, when the latter were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> study patients showed MUC2 positivity in goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MUC2 was present in nongoblet columnar epithelium in 78% of study patients with goblet cells, but in only 4% of controls without goblet cells (P&lt;0.0001) (sensitivity, 78%; specificity, 96% for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MUC2 was significantly more common in nongoblet columnar cells close to, rather than distant from, the mucosa with goblet cells (P&lt;0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, MUC2 was significantly associated with endoscopic evidence of columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in the distal esophagus, and with known risk factors for BE, such as older age, white race, frequent heartburn, and elevated body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that goblet cells likely develop from a field of MUC2-positive mucinous columnar cells, and as such, MUC2 represents a late event in the development of goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MUC2 staining in nongoblet columnar cells is a reasonably sensitive and highly specific marker for goblet cells in the distal esophagus and GEJ, and its presence is predictive of endoscopic columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus, even in patients without goblet cells </plain></SENT>
