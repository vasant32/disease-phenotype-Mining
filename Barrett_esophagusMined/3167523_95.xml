<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During follow-up to-date, four patients have developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and three have <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were preceded by progressively severe dysplastic changes but in the third no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had been previously detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was 1 per 56 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in symptomatology or gross endoscopic appearances were usually absent, even after <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had developed, indicating that biopsy is essential for early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
