<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yolk sac differentiation at this site has not been described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of germ cell differentiation initially was suggested by the finding of elevated serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient experienced disease remission after cytotoxic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Germ cell differentiation may be difficult to identify in small biopsy samples, which may not be representative of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The finding of germ cell differentiation defines therapy and predicates for a relatively good prognosis, which is contrast to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of the significance of germ cell differentiation in the selection of appropriate therapy, immunostaining for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_310'>germ cell tumor</z:mpath> markers is suggested in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> who are younger than 50 years </plain></SENT>
