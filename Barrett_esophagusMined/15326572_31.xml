<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we analyzed the histological characteristics of endoscopic resection specimens of Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 742 endoscopic resection specimens obtained from 326 patients were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following histological characteristics were evaluated: type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, grade of differentiation, depth of infiltration, invasion into lymphatic and blood vessels, and resection status (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free margins were regarded as indicating R0 status) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 31 patients had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and were excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the remaining 295 patients (711 resection specimens), histological findings were: low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, 1.0 %; high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, 2.7 %; and mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> 80.3 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinomas</z:mp> infiltrating the submucosal layer were rare (sm1 7.5 %; sm2 3.7 %; sm3 4.8 %), as were those invading lymph vessels (3.5 %), and there were none with venous invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were well-differentiated (72.2 %), and many of these (92.7 %) were limited to the mucosa, in contrast to moderately and poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (73.7 % and 22.7 %, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>R0 status was achieved in 74.5 % of patients; in 47.8 % this was after repeated endoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 26.8 % of patients, R0 resection was achieved at the first attempt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> removed by endoscopic resection are mostly limited to the mucosa, are well to moderately differentiated, and very rarely show invasion of the lymph or blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although these lesions seem to be low risk with regard to metastatic spread and therefore treatable endoscopically, improved endoscopic resection methods for achieving one-piece (en bloc) R0 resection should be developed </plain></SENT>
