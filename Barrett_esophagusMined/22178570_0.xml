<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determine whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> develop at an earlier age in multiplex Familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> (FBE) kindreds, defined by 3 or more members affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Information on BE/EAC risk factors and family history was collected from probands at eight tertiary care academic hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis and other risk factors were compared between nonfamilial (no affected relatives), duplex (two affected relatives), and multiplex (three or more affected relatives) FBE kindreds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 830 nonfamilial, 274 duplex, and 41 multiplex FBE kindreds with 274, 133, and 43 EAC and 566, 288, and 103 BE cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable mixed models adjusting for familial correlations showed that multiplex kindreds were associated with a younger age of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis (P = 0.0186) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis was significantly younger in multiplex compared with duplex and nonfamilial kindreds (57 vs. 62 vs. 63 years, respectively, P = 0.0448) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean body mass index was significantly lower in multiplex kindreds (P = 0.0033), as was smoking (P &lt; 0.0001), and reported regurgitation (P = 0.0014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Members of multiplex FBE kindreds develop EAC at an earlier age compared with nonfamilial EAC cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiplex kindreds do not have a higher proportion of common risk factors for EAC, suggesting that this aggregation might be related to a genetic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Impact: These findings indicate that efforts to identify susceptibility genes for BE and EAC will need to focus on multiplex kindreds </plain></SENT>
