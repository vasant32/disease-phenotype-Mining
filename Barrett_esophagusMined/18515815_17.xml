<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, DCA is believed to contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> during reflux where stomach contents enter the lower oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is imperative that we understand the mechanisms whereby oesophageal carcinogens function in order that therapeutic options may be developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that DCA can damage chromosomes and does so through its generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show here, after detailed experiments, that DCA appears to have a non-linear dose response for DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DCA induces DNA damage (as measured by the micronucleus assay) at doses of 100 microM and higher in oesophageal OE33 cells, but fails to induce such DNA damage below this cut-off dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also show that in terms of NF-kappaB activation (as measured by up-regulation of two NF-kappaB target genes) by DCA, a similar dose response is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This dose-response data may be important clinically as DCA exposure to the oesophagus may be used as a way to identify the 10% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> patients currently progressing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> from the 90% of patients who do not progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only quantitative studies measuring DCA concentrations in refluxates correlated with histological progression will answer this question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We further show here that ROS are behind DCAs ability to activate NF-kappaB as <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> (epigallocatechin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16918">gallate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>) abrogate DCAs ability to up-regulate NF-kappaB-controlled genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, low doses of DCA appear to be less biologically significant in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If this were to be confirmed in vivo, it might suggest that reflux patients with low DCA concentrations may be at a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> compared to patients with high levels of DCA in their refluxate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Either way, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> supplementation may possibly help prevent the deleterious effects of DCA in the whole GI tract </plain></SENT>
