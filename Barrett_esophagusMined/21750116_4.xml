<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase NOX5-S generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) when Barrett's metaplastic cells are exposed to acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides metaplastic cells, other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-producing cells (e.g., inflammatory cells) present in BE mucosa may produce additional ROS, which may also affect metaplastic cells contributing to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigate whether exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> stimulates cell proliferation by increasing NOX5-S expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low dose (10(-13) M) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> significantly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation, NOX5-S <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and protein expression in a Barrett's EA cell line FLO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced increase in NOX5-S expression was significantly inhibited by knockdown of nuclear factor (NF)-κB1 p50 with p50 small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) in EA cell lines FLO and OE33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> significantly increased p65 phosphorylation and the luciferase activity in FLO cells transfected with a NF-κB activation reporter plasmid pNF-κB-Luc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced increase in luciferase activity in FLO cells was significantly decreased by knockdown of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of p50 and p65 remarkably increased the luciferase activity in FLO cells transfected with a NOX5-S reporter plasmid NOX5-LP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation in FLO cells was significantly decreased by the MAPK kinase 1/2 inhibitor 2'-amino-3'<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25241">methoxyflavone</z:chebi> (PD98059) and ERK2 siRNA but not by ERK1 siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Likewise, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced increase in NOX5-S expression was significantly decreased by ERK2 siRNA in FLO and OE33 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> increases cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced increase in cell proliferation may depend on sequential activation of ERK2 MAPK, NF-κB1 p50, and NOX5-S </plain></SENT>
