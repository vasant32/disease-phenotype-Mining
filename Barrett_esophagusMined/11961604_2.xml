<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) was assessed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) using pH study and different quality-of-life indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We correlated both types of data and hypothesised that improvement in quality of life following LNF does not necessarily correlate with improvement in pH values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy patients presenting with typical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) underwent LNF between May 1997 and December 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated both prior to and 3 months after surgery using 24-h pH study, endoscopy, and a validated quality-of-life questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following LNF, reflux was reduced to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Howevers despite persistent reflux, the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GQLI), of these six patients improved postoperatively from 79.5 +/- 12.2 to 111.7 +/- 8.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results correlate with those of patients who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> postoperative pH studies-namely, 88.5 +/- 19.3 to 112 +/- 16.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in quality-of-life improvement between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and those without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is only a weak correlation between quality-of-life assessment and pH study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because the patient's quality of life is likely to improve following LNF, an objective means parameter of assessing the effectiveness of antireflux surgery, such as pH study or endoscopy, is recommended </plain></SENT>
