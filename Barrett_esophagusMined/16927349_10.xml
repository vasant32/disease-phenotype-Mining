<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> liquid-handling procedures were performed using a robotic module </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This automated high-throughput method minimizes the amount of time and extensive labor required for traditional in-solution digestion followed by exhaustive sample cleanup and analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, precise positioning of the droplet from the capillary HPLC separation onto the MALDI plate allows for preconcentration effects of analytes for improved sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proteins from primary esophageal Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissue were prefractionated by chromatofocusing and analyzed successfully by this automated configuration, obtaining rapid protein identifications through PMF and sequencing analyses with high sequence coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, intact protein molecular weight values were obtained as a means to further confirm protein identification and also to identify potential sequence modifications of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This simple and rapid method is a highly versatile and robust approach for the analysis of complex proteomes </plain></SENT>
