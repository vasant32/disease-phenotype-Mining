<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ablation is an accepted standard for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> glandular mucosa in the distal esophagus cannot be reliably determined at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess if use of probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) in addition to high-definition white light (HDWL) could aid in determination of residual BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, randomized, clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> undergoing ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: After an initial attempt at ablation, patients were followed-up either with HDWL endoscopy or HDWL plus pCLE, with treatment of residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> based on endoscopic findings and pCLE used to avoid overtreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The proportion of optimally treated patients, defined as those with residual BE who were treated and had complete ablation plus those without BE who were not treated and had no evidence of disease at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study was halted at the planned interim analysis based on a priori criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After enrollment was halted, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had been randomized were followed to study completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 119 patients with follow-up, there was no difference in the proportion of patients achieving optimal outcomes in the two groups (15/57, 26% for HDWL; 17/62, 27% with HDWL + pCLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other outcomes were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The study was closed after the interim analysis due to low conditional power resulting from lack of difference between groups as well as higher-than-expected residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in both arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study yields no evidence that the addition of pCLE to HDWL imaging for detection of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> can provide improved treatment </plain></SENT>
