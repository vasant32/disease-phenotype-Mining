<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified focal clusters of cells resembling pancreatic acinar cells (CPACs) in 11 of 350 biopsies of Barrett's mucosa from 120 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> enrolled in a clinical efficacy trial of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> versus <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three additional cases from our surgical files were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for trypsin and chymotrypsin was present in the CPACs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 cases, while stains for alpha-amylase and lipase were each positive in 12 of 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A few cells in the CPACs were also positive for chomogranins (12 of 13 cases), <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (seven of 13 cases), somatostatin (three of 12), gastrin (four of 11), and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (two of 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No staining was seen for insulin or glucagon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural studies performed in one case showed features of pancreatic exocrine and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> (PP-type) cells in cells within CPACs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results collectively indicate that the CPACs are aggregates of true pancreatic acinar cells admixed with a few <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This pancreatic parenchyma in Barrett's mucosa is most likely of metaplastic origin and could be derived from the transitional zone cells or from pluripotent stem cells in the esophageal mucosa or from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of mucus cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While the development of pancreatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> appears to be unrelated to drug therapy, the clinical relevance of this distinctive histological finding needs further investigation </plain></SENT>
