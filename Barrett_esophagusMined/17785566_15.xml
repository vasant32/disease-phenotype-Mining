<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared three HER2 laboratory methods, standard fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), image-based three-dimensional FISH in thick (16 microm) sections, and immunohistochemistry, to predict patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tissue microarray sections from 124 Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were analyzed by standard FISH on thin (4 microm) sections and by image-based three-dimensional FISH on thick (16 microm) sections for HER2 and chromosome-17, as well for p185(HER2) by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations with clinical and follow-up data were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only three-dimensional FISH on thick (16 microm) sections revealed HER2 gene copy gain to be associated with increased disease-specific mortality (relative risk, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-4.26; P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, standard FISH on thin (4 microm) sections and immunohistochemistry failed to predict clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low-level gain of HER2 occurred frequently in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (&gt;or=2.5-4.0 HER2 copies, 59.7%; HER2-to-chromosome-17 ratio, &gt;or=1.1-2.0; 61.2%) and defined a subpopulation for patient outcome as unfavorable as HER2 gene amplification [disease-free survival, P = 0.017 (HER2 copies)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This low-level group was neither definable by standard FISH nor immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No prognostic significance was found for chromosome-17 aneusomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-level copy gains of HER2 define a biologically distinct subpopulation of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these subtle copy number changes are not reliably detected by standard FISH in thin (4 microm) tissue sections, highlighting a thus far unrecognized <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in HER2 FISH testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results should be taken into account for accurate evaluation of biomarkers by FISH and for HER2 FISH testing in tissue sections </plain></SENT>
