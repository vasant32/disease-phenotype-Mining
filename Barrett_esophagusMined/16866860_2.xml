<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A definition of BE including endoscopic abnormality and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> by biopsy was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strict and standardized criteria were utilized for the endoscopic landmarks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three cases are reported with long-segment BE and a nodule or mass in the endoscopic cardia post-thermal ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies documented <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the cardia is unexpected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Speculation is offered as to the potential of increased proliferation and mutations at the new squamocolumnar interface after endoscopic ablation therapy to explain this association </plain></SENT>
