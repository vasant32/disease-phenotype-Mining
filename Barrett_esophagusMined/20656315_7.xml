<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of the mitotic kinase encoding gene (AURKA) results in chromosome instability (assessed from the micronuclei count) and ultimately in <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven esophageal biopsy samples representative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the phenotypic lesions occurring in the multistep process of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> in 25, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in 25, low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in 16, high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in 11, and Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 10) were obtained from long segments of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five additional biopsy samples of native esophageal mucosa were used for control purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissue samples, the immunohistochemical expression of both AURKA and TP53 gene products was scored; and the micronuclei index was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AURKA immunostaining increased progressively and significantly along with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> of the histologic phenotype (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of 10 Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> showed AURKA immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AURKA expression correlated significantly with p53 expression and the micronuclei index (both Ps &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AURKA overexpression is significantly associated with Barrett's mucosa progressing to Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and contributes to esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> via chromosome instability </plain></SENT>
