<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of p16 gene promoter is an important mechanism inactivating p16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms of p16 hypermethylation in EA are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined whether acid increases methylation of p16 gene promoter and whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase NOX5-S mediates acid-induced p16 hypermethylation in a Barrett's cell line BAR-T and an EA cell line OE33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that NOX5-S was present in BAR-T and OE33 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acid-induced increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production and cell proliferation was significantly reduced by knockdown of NOX5-S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> remarkably increased p16 promoter methylation and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, acid treatment significantly increased p16 promoter methylation and decreased p16 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of NOX5-S significantly increased p16 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, inhibited acid-induced downregulation of p16 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and blocked acid-induced increase in p16 methylation and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, overexpression of NOX5-S significantly decreased p16 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and increased p16 methylation and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, NOX5-S is present in BAR-T cells and OE33 cells and mediates acid-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NOX5-S is also involved in acid-induced hypermethylation of p16 gene promoter and downregulation of p16 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is possible that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> present in BE patients may activate NOX5-S and increase production of reactive oxygen species, which in turn increase p16 promoter methylation, downregulate p16 expression, and increase cell proliferation, thereby contributing to the progression from BE to EA </plain></SENT>
