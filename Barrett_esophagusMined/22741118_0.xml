<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This evolution has been possible due to the rapid advances in endoscopic imaging technology and expertise in the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous endoscopes had relatively poor image resolution that often did not allow the subtle mucosal changes associated with dysplastic Barrett's mucosa to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Newer endoscopic imaging techniques available today may allow endoscopists to identify areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and target biopsies accordingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These modalities which include narrow band imaging, chromoendoscopy, autofluorescence imaging, and confocal endomicroscopy as well as a few novel imaging modalities on the horizon will be discussed further </plain></SENT>
