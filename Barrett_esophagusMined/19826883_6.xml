<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Limitations of endoscopic therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> include a compromised histological assessment, the need for surveillance, subsequent procedures, and stricture formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Circumferential en bloc resection of the mucosa-submucosa complex followed by deployment of a biologic scaffold onto the remaining muscularis propria may address these concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine technical feasibility of transoral resection of the esophageal lining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transoral endoscopic inner layer esophagectomy was performed in ten swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endpoints included procedure duration, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath>, and adequacy of resection length and depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedures were successfully completed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals without perioperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedure times averaged 179 min (range 125-320) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> were found, and a mean of 1.7 (0-4) interventions for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete longitudinal resection was achieved in nine of ten animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Resection depth included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mucosal layers in 100% of tissue sections, the submucosal layers, SM1 in 100%, and SM2 in 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A portion of SM3 was adherent to the muscularis propria in 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transoral endoscopic resection of the inner esophageal layers was feasible and reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This technique may facilitate a single-step definitive treatment and staging tool for early neoplastic lesions, obviating the need for esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
