<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cohort studies were carried out using age, sex, practice, and calendar time matched control groups in the general practice research database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were used on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mortality data for the population of England and Wales were obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study compared hazard ratios (HR) for mortality using the matched controls to those found when an indirect standardisation to the mortality experience of England and Wales was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three conditions the mortality risk was slightly lower when the national population data were used compared with the internal comparison group (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> HR 1.33 v standardised mortality ratios (SMR) 1.25, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> HR 1.32 v SMR 1.32, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> HR 1.50 v SMR 1.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A bias was found towards underestimating mortality risk when cohort studies use national population <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates as a comparator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Estimates obtained when an internal comparison group has been used are probably more appropriate </plain></SENT>
