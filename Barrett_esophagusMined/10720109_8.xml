<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, p53 protein accumulation, DNA ploidy, and Glut1 in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sections of esophageal biopsy specimens from 120 patients with BM were evaluated for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, p53 protein, and Glut1 expression by immunohistochemistry, and DNA ploidy by Feulgen stain and image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cases with diploid DNA histograms, the percentage cells in the G0G1 and G2M phases of the cell cycle were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 108 diploid cases 19 (28%) of 69 cases with G0G1 &gt; or = 90% or G2M &gt; or = 8.33% were p53-positive, in contrast to only 1 (3%) of 39 cases with lower G0G1 or G2M (P = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 32 p53-positive cases 11 (32%) were aneuploid, in contrast to none (0%) of 88 p53-negative cases (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten (91%) of 11 aneuploid cases were high-grade dysplasial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (HGD/CA), compared with only 1 (1%) of 109 diploid cases (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five (45%) of 11 cases with HGD/CA were Glut1-positive, in contrast to none (0%) of 109 cases without HGD/CA (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data strongly suggest that in BM, after oxidative DNA damage, as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, there is an increase in the percentage of cells in the G0G1 or G2M phases of the cell cycle to enable repair of damaged DNA; in some of these cases this is followed sequentially by p53 gene mutation and protein accumulation, DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, HGD, and CA with or without Glut1 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These events can be detected in routinely processed biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
