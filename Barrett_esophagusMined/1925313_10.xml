<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With use of these assays, we studied the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with H. pylori and four other upper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851377" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions</z:e>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, pernicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (which accompanies type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>), and duodenal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>H. pylori was present in only 39% of 41 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> whose gastric biopsy specimens were examined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each serologic assay correctly categorized 39 (95.1%) of the 41 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For both assays the frequency of seropositivity noted for 58 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was not different from that noted for age- and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 40 patients with pernicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, the results of assays for IgA and IgG were positive for 17.5% and 0%, respectively; these prevalences were significantly less than the 50% (IgA) and 40% (IgG) positivities noted for matched controls (P less than .01 for each; McNemar's test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 57 patients with documented duodenal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcers</z:hpo>, the results of assays for IgG and IgA were positive for 100% and 98.2%, respectively; these prevalences were significantly higher than the rate noted for matched controls (P less than .001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo> and P = .02 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcers</z:hpo> for IgA assay) </plain></SENT>
