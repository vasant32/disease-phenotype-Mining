<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (LSBE) is a recognized risk factor for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0000467'>esophageal dysplasia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> arising within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> below a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing Z-line (i.e., in native cardiac mucosa) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regular endoscopic surveillance is required in patients with LSBE and is frequently performed in short segment BE (SSBE), but the need for surveillance in cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CIM) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately IM arising in SSBE and immediately below a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Z-line can be indistinguishable histologically on H&amp;E stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous reports suggest that the appearance of superficial CK20 immunohistochemical staining accompanied by intermediate and deep CK7 positivity is characteristic of BE, whereas CIM specimens show superficial and deep CK20 positivity and weak to absent CK7 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that CK7/20 immunostaining of metaplastic biopsies from the esophagus and stomach would allow complete differentiation of these two entities when correlated with the endoscopic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We undertook an evaluation of gastric and esophageal specimens to determine whether these characteristics were valid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases of both BE (long and short segment) and CIM, as well as cases of gastric cardiac biopsies lacking IM, were evaluated for CK7 and CK20 and correlated with the endoscopic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed that, although the "Barrett's" pattern of CK7/20 was maintained for many cases of BE, the sensitivity and specificity were only moderate (65% and 56%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pattern of staining for the CIM was variable, i.e., some cases showed a CK7/20 Barrett's pattern despite a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The differences between this and previous studies may be due to inaccurate visualization of SSBE on endoscopy, the development of very early SSBE cases, inter-observer variability, fixation differences, or antibody differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whatever the cause of the differences, if results between laboratories are not comparable, CK7/20 immunostaining cannot be used to differentiate reliably between IM present in biopsy specimens taken from above versus below the Z-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, further studies should be performed to determine whether the presence or absence of a Barrett's pattern of CK7/20 immunostaining could predict progression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
