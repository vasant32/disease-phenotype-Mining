<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Widespread applicability of tissue-based <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is likely to require (1) accurate methods for assaying archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) histopathology specimens taken at endoscopy, and (2) validation studies of promising biomarkers in different patient cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 30 genes were significantly differentially expressed by histopathology tissue type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The direction and magnitude of the differences were very similar to those found in previous studies using fresh frozen tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Novel upregulated genes were TSPAN8 (also known as CO-029), TSPAN24 (CD151), EGR1 and TCIRG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Novel downregulated genes were DPYD, TSPAN29 (CD9) and Ets1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strong associations between histopathology type and gene expression were observed with the overexpressed genes: cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), for which histopathology type explained 77.7% of the variation in expression, TSPAN1 (73.5%), TSPAN8 (62.9%), SPARC (62.1%), MMP7 (50.8%); and the under-expressed genes ADH7 (53.7%), APC (58.2%), RAR-gamma (51.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was isolated from 54 FFPE small endoscopic biopsies from patients with Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (BE), esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC), or control patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous-lined esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiplexed tandem PCR (MT-PCR) was used to quantitate 50 selected candidate genes for BE and control genes in duplicate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) was conducted to explore the presence of global differences in gene expression profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the transformed data was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed between different histological subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differentially expressed genes with a fold change of ≥2 (upregulated) or ≤-2 (downregulated) are reported with the p value for each comparison (EAC vs. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, EAC vs. BE and BE vs. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to control the false discovery rate at 0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in expression of select genes are strongly associated with BE or EAC or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study's findings for many highly differentially expressed genes are very similar to those previously reported, suggesting that these genes should be tested further in longitudinal studies for their potential role as biomarkers of progression to more advanced Barrett disease </plain></SENT>
