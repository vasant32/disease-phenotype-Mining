<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PLACE: Endoscopy Department, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Hospital, Centro MÃ©dico Nacional Siglo XXI, IMSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A prospective, transversal, observational and comparative assay of 48 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in whom high endoscopy with biopsy harvest was performed; otherwise, colonoscopy was performed in eight patients with confirmed BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty men and 18 women were studied with an average age of 53 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 100%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was determined as <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and location were rectal in 43.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of BO was 22.9% in addition to 0.74 to 2% in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This implies an odds ratio calculated at 36.43 (p = 0.00000) and 3.09 p = 0.00007), respectively, for risk to present BO concomitant with CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical significance in relation to age, smoking habit, and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among eight patients with BO without CCR, only one had a tubulovellous polypus (12.5%) identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the results were not to conclusive to affirm the association of BA with CCR, the high prevalence found justifies the performance of routine endoscopy in CCR carrier patients with reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
