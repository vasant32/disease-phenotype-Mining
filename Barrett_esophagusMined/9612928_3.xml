<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in prospective clinical research trials, a combined therapy of potent pharmacological acid suppression with superficial coagulation of metaplastic epithelium is examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By local coagulation using photodynamic therapy, laser or <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation, a complete reconstitution of squamous epithelium should be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on a case of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, who developed high-grade dysplastic cell formations under <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As part of a clinical study, the patient was treated over a period of one year monthly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We monitored the result of the therapy over the period of one year with endoscopy, histolgical investigations and DNA image cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultimately a decision in favour of a further surgical management was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic instruments to identify patients with a high risk for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> are discussed </plain></SENT>
