<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Double-contrast esophagograms with flow artifacts of 35 patients were evaluated to determine the effect on radiographic interpretation and to assess the method of examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial radiographs obtained during swallowing of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> were compared with those obtained after a slight delay while patients repeatedly dry swallowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When severe surface flow artifacts were present, the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucosal disease</z:e> was underestimated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mild surface flow artifacts interfered with the demonstration of the reticular pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> flow artifacts caused misinterpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The demonstration of strictures was unaffected by flow artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the dry swallowing maneuver and some delay improve depiction of esophageal surface details on double-contrast radiographs and obviate interpretive error from <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> flow artifacts </plain></SENT>
