<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chromoendoscopy is traditionally used to identify inconspicuous Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and mark the boundaries before endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trimodal imaging endoscopy is useful in identifying early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy (lateral and deep margin clearance) of trimodal imaging endoscopy-assisted EMR in early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in a tertiary referral setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The entire Barrett's segment was visualized by high-resolution endoscopy followed by autofluorescence imaging, and suspicious areas were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Narrow band imaging and magnification was used to confirm the suspicious areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outer boundary of the lesion was then marked using the tip of a snare diathermy and EMR was performed using multiband mucosectomy technique by a single operator (KR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included: 13 patients had high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN); 3 patients had intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IMC); (8 males, median age, 69.5 (range, 50-77) years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (interquartile range (IQR), 2-5 cm; median length, 3 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were successfully identified, using trimodal imaging endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall EMR was complete in 14 of 16 (81.2%) patients with early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of 16 patients (18%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with pre-EMR HGIN) were considered to have incomplete EMR (deep margins involved), but operative histology showed only Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in 2 (histological false positive) and IMC in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, overall 14 of 16 (87.5%) patients had complete EMR of the original lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients who did not undergo esophagectomy, there was no disease recurrence on endoscopic biopsies at a mean follow-up of 8 (IQR, 6-12) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three of the 16 patients (18.75%) with post-EMR <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were successfully treated with APC/hemoclips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Trimodal imaging endoscopy is a feasible alternative to chromoendoscopy to identify inconspicuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and assist EMR of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
