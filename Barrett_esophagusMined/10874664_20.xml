<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the esophagogastric junction is as high as 36% in endoscopy studies; the majority of cases (approximately 67%) occur in short segments of esophageal columnar mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The validity of these studies has been questioned, however, because of heterogenous underlying diseases prompting endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the frequency and origin of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the esophagogastric junction, we histologically evaluated the entire esophagogastric junction for the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> using Alcian blue/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff mucin stains in 223 consecutive autopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Precise localization of the Z line in relation to the esophagogastric junction and tongues of esophageal columnar-appearing mucosa were noted in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean patient age was 47 years; 69% of patients were male, and 63% were white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty five of 223 cases (11%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 2 of 25 cases (8%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the esophagus; the remaining 23 cases (92%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Male gender, advanced age, white ethnic origin, and short tongues of esophageal columnar mucosa were not associated with gastric cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An association of distal gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (P &lt; .01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005231'>chronic gastritis</z:hpo> (P &lt; .01) with gastric cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> suggests a role for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the esophagogastric junction in an unselected autopsy population is low (11%) even after exhaustive histologic evaluation using Alcian blue mucin stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> is confined to the gastric cardia in more than 90% of cases with no association to male gender, white ethnic origin, advanced age, or the presence of short segments of esophageal columnar-appearing mucosa at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that caution is warranted when applying the findings of endoscopy studies to the development of preventive and screening strategies aimed at identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in an asymptomatic general population </plain></SENT>
