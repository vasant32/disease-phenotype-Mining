<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate AMACR expression in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and to determine whether its expression can be used to detect dysplastic epithelium in these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty-four routinely processed biopsy and/or resection specimens from 134 patients with BE [M/F ratio: 5.7, mean age: 67 y (36 negative (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> only), 14 indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (IND), 16 low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), 32 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and 36 invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (ACA)] and 74 specimens from 74 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) [56 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 18 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, M/F ratio: 1.8, mean age: 55 y (17 negative, 7 IND, 26 LGD, 10 HGD, and 14 ACA)] were immunostained with a monoclonal AMACR antibody (p504S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of cytoplasmic staining in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases was evaluated in a blinded fashion according to the following grading system: 0, negative (0% cells positive); 1+, 1% to 10% cells positive; 2+, 10% to 50% cells positive; or 3+, &gt;50% cells positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with BE, AMACR was not expressed in any negative foci (0%) but was significantly increased (P&lt;0.0001) in foci of LGD (38%), HGD (81%), and ACA (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of 14 (21%) IND foci from 3 BE patients were only focally positive (grade 1: 7%, 2: 14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 1 of these 3 patients had follow-up information available and had developed ACA subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in patients with IBD, AMACR was not expressed in any foci considered negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, but was significantly increased (P&lt;0.0001) in foci of LGD (96%), HGD (80%), and ACA (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 1/7 (14%) IND focus from 1 patient was focally positive (grade 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for the detection of LGD and HGD in BE and IBD was 38% and 81%, and 96% and 80%, respectively, for the 2 types of disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The specificity was 100% for both BE and IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AMACR is involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in BE and IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The high degree of specificity of AMACR for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in BE and IBD suggests that it may be useful to detect neoplastic epithelium in these conditions </plain></SENT>
