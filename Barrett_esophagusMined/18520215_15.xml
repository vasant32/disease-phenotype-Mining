<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to explore this profile in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were invited to attend the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> screening where they underwent anthropometry, segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis, and blood pressure measurement, and had blood taken for quantification of fasting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, C-reactive protein, and adipocytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred two patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-six percent of Barrett patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and 78% were centrally <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> were significantly more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> by body mass index, had a 9.4 cm greater waistline, were more hypertensive, and were insulin resistant with 25% having <z:hpo ids='HP_0008283'>fasting hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> compared with Barrett patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic syndrome</z:e> was associated with elevated C-reactive protein, leptin, and a trend toward <z:mp ids='MP_0004893'>decreased adiponectin levels</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of patients with long-segment Barrett had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and 92% were centrally <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> compared with 23.8% and 62%, respectively (P = 0.007 and 0.005) in short-segment Barrett </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Long-segment Barrett was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and significantly increased levels of interleukin-6 compared with short-segment Barrett </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in Barrett far exceeds population norms, and the syndrome was significantly associated with the length of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data do suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> may be relevant to the continuum of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> within the Barrett cohort </plain></SENT>
