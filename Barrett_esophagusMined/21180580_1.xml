<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic resection has an increasing role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wanted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multi-band ligation/resection [ER-L] without pre-injection in BE with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> [HGD] and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> [IMCA].Methods: A cohort of 65 consecutive patients from a single academic medical center, who underwent ER-L as part of endoscopic eradication therapy for BE with HGD/IMCA were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ER-L was performed afterendoscopic mapping and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, adjunctive ablative therapies including photodynamic therapy, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation and radiofrequency ablation were applied to achieve complete eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter biopsy surveillance was performed per protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were prescribed a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measurements: Change in histopathological stage; eradication of BE and HGD/IMCA; adverse events.Results: The median number of ER-L applications in each session was 4 (range 1-6) and the mean total number of ER-L sessions was 1.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with prior forceps biopsy, histopathology from the ER-L specimen changed in 24 (37.5%, p = &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With median follow-up of 15 months (range 8-42), complete and durable BE eradication was achieved with ER-L alone in 36 (60%) and the remainder with adjunctive ablation therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were nine complications (four (6%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, five (7.5%) strictures, zero <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath>).Conclusions: ER-L without submucosal (SM) pre-injection is safe and effective when applied selectively for eradication of BE with HGD/IMCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is significant change in pathological stage after ER-L conferring a diagnostic and staging advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ER-L may be used adjunctively with ablation therapies </plain></SENT>
