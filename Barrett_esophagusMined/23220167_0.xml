<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) and also might contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), although results are inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI) on the risk of BE and investigated whether race, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a case-control study using data from eligible patients who underwent elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy; 237 patients had BE and the other 1021 patients served as endoscopy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed data and tissue samples from enrolled patients who were eligible for screening colonoscopies at a primary care clinic (colonoscopy controls, n = 479) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, completed a survey, and had anthropometric measurements taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WHR was categorized as high if it was 0.9 or greater for men or 0.85 or greater for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed with logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no association between BMI and BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, more patients with BE had a high WHR (92.4%) than endoscopy controls (79.5%) or colonoscopy controls (84.6%) (P &lt; .001 and P = .008, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In adjusted analysis, patients with BE were 2-fold more likely to have a high WHR than endoscopy controls (odds ratio [OR], 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.5), this association was stronger for patients with long-segment BE (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.0-7.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A high WHR was associated significantly with BE only in whites (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.4), but not in blacks or Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>, or gastroesophageal valve flap grade could not account for the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High WHR, but not BMI, is associated with a significant increase in the risk of BE, especially long-segment BE and in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The association is not caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
