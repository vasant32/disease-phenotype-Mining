<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This increase has occurred predominantly among white men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of ethnicity and selected clinical features on the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in an urban, minority population, we retrospectively reviewed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> from 1980 to 1995 were identified using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> registry data base and patient medical records at UMDNJ-University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were self-reported ethnicity and a confirmed pathologic diagnosis of either esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (ADENO) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (SCCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data abstracted from the record included age and year of diagnosis, weeks of survival, and risk factors, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and tobacco and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 150 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, 139 (93%) were SCCA and 11 (7%) were ADENO; the male:female ratio was 11:4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>African and Latino Americans comprised 87% and white Americans 13% of the group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of ADENO increased during the study period: 1980-1984, 1 case; 1985-1989, 3 cases; and 1990-1995, 7 cases (P = .022); whereas the incidence of SCCA remained constant during the same intervals: 51, 52, and 36 cases, respectively (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By ethnicity, ADENO occurred more frequently among whites (7/19, 37%) than among African and Latino Americans (4/131, 3%); SCCA was more common among African and Latino Americans (127/131, 97%) than among whites (12/19, 63%) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other risk factors did not influence the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study concluded that the incidence of ADENO increased, primarily among white men, from 1980 to 1995 at UMDNJ-University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the incidence of SCCA remained constant and was the primary type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in African and Latino Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study supports previous reports that ethnicity influences the histology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
