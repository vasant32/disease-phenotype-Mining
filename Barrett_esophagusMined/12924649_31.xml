<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few data are available about the relationship between age and length on the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess age and length as risk factors for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were enrolled in a multicenter study establishing a tissue bank of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients 1994 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographics, length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (centimeters), and histology were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were assessed, including patient age, gender, and length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed comparing prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (which included the presence of any <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and high- or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) to age and length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 309 patients were studied [278 (90%) male and 31 (10%) female]: 5 had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus, 11 had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 29 had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were younger than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> [62 +/- 0.8 years vs 67 +/- 1.7 years (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, P = 0.02)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> increased by 3.3%/yr of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in patients with Barrett's alone vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 4.0 +/- 0.2 cm vs 5.4 +/- 0.4 cm (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> length &gt; or = 3 cm had a significantly greater prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> compared to length &lt; 3 cm (23% vs 9%, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> increased by 14%/cm of <z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>increased length</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed age and length to be independent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusions: prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is strongly associated with age and length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results can be used to develop a strategy for screening/surveillance based on age and length of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
