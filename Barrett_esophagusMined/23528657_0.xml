<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Accurate endoscopic detection and staging are critical for appropriate management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE)-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior investigation has demonstrated that the distribution of endoscopically detectable early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is not uniform but instead favors specific directional distributions within a short BE segment; however, it is unknown whether the directional distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> differs with increasing distance from the gastroesophageal junction, including in patients with long-segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify whether directional distribution of BE-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is influenced by distance from the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary-care referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients with either short-segment or long-segment BE undergoing EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Directional distribution of BE-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> stratified by distance from gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EMR was performed on 60 lesions meeting study criteria during the specified time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathology demonstrated low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 22% (13/60), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 38% (23/60), intramucosal (T1a) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 23% (14/60), and invasive (≥T1b) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 17% (10/60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Directional distribution of lesions was not uniform (P &lt; .001), with 62% of lesions (37/60) located between the 1 o'clock and 5 o'clock positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When circular statistics methodology was used, there was no difference in the directional distribution of neoplastic lesions located within 3 cm of the gastroesophageal junction compared with ��3 cm from the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Single-center study may limit external validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The directional distribution of neoplastic foci within a BE segment is not influenced by distance of the lesion from the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mucosa between the 1 o'clock and 5 o'clock locations merits careful attention and endoscopic inspection in individuals with both short-segment BE and long-segment BE </plain></SENT>
