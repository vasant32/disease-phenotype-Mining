<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) is the main risk factor for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus (AC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate symptoms of patients with AC to identify those patients with a high risk for this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 117 consecutive patients with known AC were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prospectively <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were interviewed with a standardised questionnaire comprising 120 items: social status, other diseases, risk factors, therapy of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and, as a main part: current symptoms and those experienced at earlier times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 85 % of the patients had often or sometimes reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>46 % of the patients with reflux symptoms had such symptoms daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time span for this symptom was 20 years with a range from 1 year to 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 21 % of the patients the reflux symptoms stopped (median) three years (range two months -- 30 years) before the diagnosis of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 55 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had one or more esophago-gastroscopy examinations before the diagnosis of AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients showed significantly more often earlier <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stages than those patients without an endoscopy before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Heartburn was treated with medication in 78 % of the patients (67 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient had previously undergone antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 15 % of the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus show no, and in addition 25 % only discrete, heartburn; 1. an endoscopy due to heartburn was done in half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, and 2. the medications do not fulfil the therapeutic standard; 3.patients with endoscopy had significantly more frequently an earlier <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
