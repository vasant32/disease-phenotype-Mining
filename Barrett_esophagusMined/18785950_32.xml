<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently published surgical series demonstrated that even in case of minimal submucosal invasion of BC, the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> is very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In consequence, also these patients might be eligible for curative ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic resection (ER) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From September 1996 to September 2003, the suspicion or definite diagnosis of submucosal BC was made in 80 patients referred to our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of those, 21 patients (20 male [95.2%], mean age 62 +/- 9 yr, range 47-78) fulfilled the definition of "low-risk" submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>: invasion of the upper submucosal third (sm1), absence of infiltration into lymph vessels/veins, histological grade G1/2, and macroscopic type I/II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ET was carried out using ER with the suck-and-cut technique with or without an additive ablation of non-neoplastic remnants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One of the 21 patients was referred to surgery directly after the detection of sm1 invasion at the beginning of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died (not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related) before completion of ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using definitive ET, complete remission (CR) was achieved in 18 of 19 patients (95%) after a mean of 5.3 months (range 1-18) and a mean of 2.9 resections (range 1-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one minor complication (<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> without drop in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level &gt;2 g/dL) occurred (5% of patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up (FU) of 62 months (range 45-89), recurrent or metachronous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were found in 5 patients (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Repeat ET was carried out successfully using ER (4 patients) and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In one of the 19 patients (5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> freedom had not been achieved after a total of 2 ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This patient died of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">heart attack</z:e> before surgery could be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The calculated 5-yr survival rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 patients was 66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As in mucosal BC, ER is associated with favorable outcomes even in case of "low-risk" submucosal BC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Further and larger clinical trials are required before a general recommendation for ER as the treatment of choice in "low-risk" submucosal BC can be given </plain></SENT>
