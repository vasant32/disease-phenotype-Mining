<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to assess the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation in combination with high-dose <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> therapy to ablate nondysplastic Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 73 patients with histologically confirmed Barrett's epithelium, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation was used in combination with maximal acid suppression (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg three times a day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologic and endoscopic changes were evaluated at 6- and 12-month intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 69 of 70 patients (98.6%) complete squamous regeneration was achieved after a median of 2 argon plasma coagulation sessions (range 1 to 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 12 months (range 2 to 51 months) there has been no relapse or evidence of the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> under continuous acid suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients (4.3%) developed a mild stricture of the distal esophagus that resolved after a single session of bougie dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation in combination with high-dose <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> treatment is an effective and safe technique for complete ablation of nondysplastic Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restoration of squamous mucosa after <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation appears to be long-lasting </plain></SENT>
