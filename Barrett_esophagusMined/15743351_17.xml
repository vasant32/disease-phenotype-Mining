<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), the reflux-damaged esophageal squamous epithelium heals through the process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) rather than through the regeneration of more squamous cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that squamous epithelium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> might have abnormalities in activation of the extracellular-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway that may facilitate esophageal repair through <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in response to acid-induced injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic biopsies were taken from distal esophageal squamous mucosa in patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and in controls, before and after esophageal perfusion with 0.1 N HCl acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation, acid-induced ERK1/2 activity and phosphorylation, and localization of phosphorylated ERK1/2 were determined using immunoblotting, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> exhibited significantly lower baseline levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression (35 +/- 4%vs 90 +/- 21% control, p= 0.01) Acid exposure significantly increased ERK1/2 activity (346.6 +/- 51.90 to 446.8 +/- 62.44 RIU, p= 0.02) and phosphorylation (3.55 +/- 1.26 to 4.49 +/- 1.25 [ratio phospho/total ERK], p= 0.01) in the squamous mucosa of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients, but not in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and patients with uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, there are significant differences in baseline levels and in acid-induced activation of ERK1/2 in esophageal squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first description of a molecular, phenotypic feature that distinguishes the esophageal squamous mucosa of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
