<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hallmark of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is an increase in esophageal exposure to gastric juice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This exposure can result in complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, stricture, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine if there are specific pH exposure patterns that are associated with the development of these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 24-hour esophageal pH data for 50 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 154 patients with proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were analyzed for time spent at different pH intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased esophageal acid exposure at a given interval occurred when the cumulative time of exposure exceeded the 95th percentile of that measured in the 50 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects for that interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The greatest prevalence of mucosal damage was found in the those patients with increased esophageal exposure to pH 0 to 2, corresponding to the known pKa of pepsin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This exposure was not related to a hypersecretory state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, mucosal injury was associated with an increased esophageal exposure to pH 7 to 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that mucosal injury in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is related to the exposure time to gastric juice with a pH of less than 2 or greater than 7 </plain></SENT>
