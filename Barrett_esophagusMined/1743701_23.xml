<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the histology and morphogenesis of the double muscularis mucosae in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, eight specimens resected from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were compared histopathologically with 352 specimens resected from patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A double muscularis mucosae was observed in seven (87.5%) of the eight cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but in none of the 352 cases without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mucosa in the segment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> consisted of columnar epithelium, a superficial lamina propria, a superficial muscularis mucosae, a deep lamina propria, and a deep muscularis mucosae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distal end of the superficial muscularis mucosae was connected to the deep muscularis mucosae at the esophagogastric junction, and its proximal end was located in fibrous tissue below the squamocolumnar junction of the mucosal epithelium or the distal edge of the erosive lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The deep muscularis mucosae in the portion with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was continuous with the original muscularis mucosae of the proximal esophagus and muscularis mucosae of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is considered to be not merely a metaplastic lesion within the epithelium, but a newly developed lesion containing columnar epithelium, lamina propria, and a superficial muscularis mucosae on the lamina propria of the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
