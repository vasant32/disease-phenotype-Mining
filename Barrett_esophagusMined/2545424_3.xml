<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and seven patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight of 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had a positive image (sensitivity 47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, none of the seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> had a positive image (specificity 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pentagastrin did not have a significant effect on the sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the type of Barrett's epithelium and the sensitivity of the imaging results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the test is more frequently positive in those patients with more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi> pertechnetate imaging should not be used as a screening test for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, as the negative predictive value of the test is limited </plain></SENT>
