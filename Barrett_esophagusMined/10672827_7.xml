<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Incomplete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or specialized columnar epithelium (SCE) is the histologic hallmark of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), but it may also occur at a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing gastroesophageal junction without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether differences occur between BE patients and those with SCE at the squamocolumnar junction but without BE (abbreviated JSCE), in terms of endoscopic and histologic signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) and Helicobacter pylori <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1059 consecutive patients referred for endoscopy in one hospital district in Finland were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens (at least two from each site) were obtained from the gastric antrum and the corpus of the stomach and from the esophagogastric junction and distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Classical BE was detected in 25 (2%) and JSCE in 99 (9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> in the metaplastic mucosa was observed in six BE patients but in none of the JSCE patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis the independent risk factors for BE were endoscopic erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (odds ratio (OR), 6.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.50-14.82), male sex (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.20-7.65), and age (OR, 1.02 per year; 95% CI, 1.00-1.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The independent risk factors for JSCE were endoscopic erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.08-3.29) and age (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05) but not H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.83-2.97) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005231'>chronic gastritis</z:hpo> (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.44-1.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, however, JSCE was associated with antral-predominant atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (77% H. pylori-positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike in JSCE patients, male sex strongly predominated among BE patients (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean ages of BE and JSCE patients did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both BE and JSCE without BE increase in prevalence with age, and both associate with endoscopic erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> but not with H. pylori <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, because of the marked sex disparity, JSCE cannot be a direct precursor of BE, and some factors other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> alone also play a role in the pathogenesis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared with BE, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is a rare finding in JSCE, and endoscopic surveillance with biopsy specimens from JSCE patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is not recommended </plain></SENT>
