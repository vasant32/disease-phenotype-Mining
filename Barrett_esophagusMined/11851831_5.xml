<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An increased prevalence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> has been reported following Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo> in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has remained unknown whether this might also appertain to individuals with other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore carried out this study to determine the effect of eradicating H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in a series of Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of a total of 203 H. pylori-positive patients successfully cured of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, 82 cases (58 males, 24 females) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric disease</z:e>, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo>, were included in the present study; median age 56 years (range 18-80) and median follow up of 24 months (range 6-65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were investigated clinically and endoscopically at regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mild reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> developed after eradication in three of 55 (5.5%) patients formerly without this condition, while it improved after eradication in five of 27 (18.5%) patients, with the disease endoscopically diagnosed prior to eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimated incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> within 3 years was 4.8% after cure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> developed after eradication in six of 58 (10.3%) patients who did not have it prior to the therapy, while the condition did not improve in 24 patients affected before eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic esophageal changes after H. pylori eradication in the present series of Japanese patients were relatively infrequent and mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This therapeutic approach thus appears to be safe and unproblematic </plain></SENT>
