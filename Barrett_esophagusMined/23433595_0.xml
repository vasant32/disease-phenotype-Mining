<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: New endoscopic imaging techniques, such as autofluorescence imaging (AFI) and narrow-band imaging (NBI), have been developed to improve the detection of neoplastic lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical utility of AFI and magnification NBI to detect high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and early esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) and the interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective tandem study of eligible patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single, academic tertiary care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Forty-two patients with a history of confirmed BE were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: The BE segment was examined under high-definition white-light endoscopy, and the presence of visible lesions was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, AFI and magnification NBI were performed in tandem on areas of the BE segment away from visible lesions; images obtained by these 2 systems were graded according to the color of reflected light and surface patterns, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were obtained at the end of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (NPV) of the AFI and NBI patterns for the detection of HGD/EAC and interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 42 patients enrolled, 14 (33%) had HGD/EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On patient-based analysis, AFI alone had a sensitivity, specificity, and NPV of 50%, 61%, and 71%, respectively, and the overall accuracy for the detection of HGD/EAC patients was 57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By using magnification NBI in tandem fashion, the sensitivity and NPV improved to 71% and 76%, respectively, with a decrease in specificity to 46% and in overall accuracy to 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 2 techniques had moderate interobserver agreement for both the patterns and prediction of histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Uncontrolled study performed at an academic center by expert endoscopists in a high-risk population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By using a multimodality endoscope, both AFI and magnification NBI had limited clinical accuracy and moderate overall interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>AFI does not appear to be useful as a broad-based technique for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
