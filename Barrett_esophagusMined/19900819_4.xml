<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: As part of our ongoing quality improvement effort, we evaluated our conventional approach to post-oesophagectomy management by comparing it to an alternative postoperative management pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records from 386 consecutive patients undergoing oesophagectomy with gastric conduit for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were analysed retrospectively (July 2004 to August 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conventional pathway involved a routine radiographic contrast swallow study at 5-7 days after oesophagectomy with initiation of oral intake if no leak was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the alternative pathway, a feeding jejunostomy was placed for enteral feeding and used exclusively until oral intake was gradually initiated at home at 4 weeks after oesophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No contrast swallow was obtained in the alternative pathway group unless indicated by clinical suspicion of an anastomotic leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each group was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with respect to anastomotic leak rates, length of hospitalisation, re-admission and other complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 276 (72%) patients underwent conventional postoperative management, 110 (28%) followed the alternative pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics were similar in both the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The anastomotic leak rate was lower in the alternative pathway with three clinically significant leaks (2.7%) versus 33 in the conventional pathway (12.0%; p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients undergoing a radiographic contrast swallow examination, a false-negative rate of 5.8% was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The swallow study of 14 patients (5.9%) was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of oral contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, 7.3% of patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences overall in postoperative pulmonary or cardiac complications associated with either pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median length of hospitalisation was 2 days shorter for the alternative pathway (7 days) than the conventional pathway (9 days; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in unplanned re-admission rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An alternative postoperative pathway following oesophagectomy involving delayed oral intake and avoidance of a routine contrast swallow study is associated with a shortened length of hospitalisation without a higher risk of complication after hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
