<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated here the role of iNOS and NO in DNA damage induction and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signalling in esophageal cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> develops in a background of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> secondary to reflux disease, it is possible that <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> like NO may be important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that reflux components like stomach acid and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (DCA)] can induce iNOS gene and protein expression and produce NO generation in esophageal cells, using real-time PCR, western blotting and NO sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39442">fluorescent probes</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This up-regulation of iNOS expression was not dependent on NF-κB activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DCA-induced DNA damage was independent of NF-κB and only partially dependent on iNOS and NO, as measured by the micronucleus assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These same reflux constituents also activated the oncogenic transcription factor NF-κB, as measured by transcription factor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gene expression studies with NF-κB linked genes (e.g. interleukin-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we show here for the first time that basal levels of NF-κB activity (and possibly acid and DCA-induced NF-κB) are dependent on iNOS/NO and this may lead to a positive feedback loop whereby induced iNOS is upstream of NF-κB, hence prolonging and potentially amplifying this signalling, presumably through NO activation of NF-κB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we confirm increased protein levels of iNOS in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and, therefore, in neoplastic development in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
