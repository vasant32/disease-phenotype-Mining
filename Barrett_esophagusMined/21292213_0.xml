<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and educational value of a new model for providing endoscopy for medically indigent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: A model can be developed at minimal cost to provide essential endoscopy services for underserved patients while providing resident education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In our community, there was limited access to endoscopy for indigent patients, and surgical resident endoscopy experience was inadequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address these problems, a new endoscopy program was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Procedures were performed during underused times in a hospital endoscopy clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopies were performed on patients referred from the public health clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were performed by senior surgical residents supervised by attending endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data were collected over 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopies were performed for both diagnostic and screening purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 205 colonoscopies, 65 upper endoscopies, and 14 combined endoscopies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: Positive findings on endoscopy were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 205 colonoscopies, 35% had positive findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six (32%) patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and 6 (3%) patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of 65 upper endoscopies, 34 (55%) patients had positive findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thirty (47%) patients had moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, 2 (3%) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo>, 2 (5%) patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, 10 (15%) patients had positive H. pylori biopsies, and 2 (3%) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The program incurred minimal incremental costs, and large cost savings were realized in prevention and early detection of colon and gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our 30-month experience resulted in clinical benefits to patients at minimal incremental cost while reducing future medical costs by preventing and detecting disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Surgical residents received essential training </plain></SENT>
