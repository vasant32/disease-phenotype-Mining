<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopists seldom obtain biopsy specimens from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing gastro-oesophageal junction, and therefore short segments of SCE in this region may go unrecognised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied patients who had short segments of SCE at the gastro-oesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients scheduled for elective endoscopic examinations in our general endoscopy unit, irrespective of indication, were questioned for symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At endoscopy, severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> was graded, and biopsy specimens obtained from the squamocolumnar junction, irrespective of its appearance or location in the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 142 patients without endoscopically apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, 26 (18%) were found to have SCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with SCE were white, and the male/female ratio was 1.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, non-whites accounted for 14% of the 114 patients without SCE and the male/female ratio was 0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The groups did not differ significantly in the frequency of symptoms and endoscopic signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastrooesophageal reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that adults frequently have unrecognised segments of SCE at the gastro-oesophageal junction; this may underlie the rising frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of the gastrooesophageal junction in the USA and Europe </plain></SENT>
