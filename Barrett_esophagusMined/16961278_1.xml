<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cDNA retro-transcribed from equal quantity <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from BE and CIM epithelial tissues were labeled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37990">Cy3</z:chebi> and Cy5 fluorescence as probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mixed probe was hybridized with three pieces BiostarH-40s double dot human whole gene chip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chips were scanned with a ScanArray 4000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The acquired images were analyzed using GenePix Pro 3.0 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found a total of 141 genes were screened out that exhibited differentially expression more than 2 times in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three chips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was identified that in gene expression profiles of BE, 74 genes were up-regulated and 67 down-regulated as compared with CIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The comparison between the difference of gene expression profile changes in BE and CIM epithelia revealed that there existed the difference between BE and CIM at gene level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>141 genes with the expression more than two time were probably related to the occurrence and development of BE and the promotion or progress in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
