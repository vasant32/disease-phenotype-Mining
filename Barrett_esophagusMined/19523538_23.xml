<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only limited data are available on chemoprevention in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed using data from patients with documented BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prescription information was collected from pharmacy records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analyses were performed to examine the association between prescriptions for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>/aspirin, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0000467'>esophageal dysplasia</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> during follow-up (from 1982 to 2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We examined 344 patients diagnosed with BE (mean age 61 years, 90.4% Caucasian, 94.2% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After BE diagnosis, 67.2% of the patients were prescribed <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> for a mean duration of 5.1 years; 49.1% were prescribed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> for a mean duration of 3.6 years, and 25.3% were prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> for a mean duration of 2.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During 2620 patient-years, high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> developed in 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment after BE diagnosis was associated with a reduced risk of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>; this association persisted after adjustment for gender, age, and the length of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> and/or aspirin therapy were associated with a nonsignificant trend toward lower incidence of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy reduces the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
