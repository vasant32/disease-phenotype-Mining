<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The rise in mitotic polyploid cells in near-senescence (phase III) of human fibroblast cells has been found to contain diplochromosomes (four chromatids) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For tetraploid cells, this translates into 46 pairs of sister chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested, from the increase in numbers of such cells, that they might deviate from expected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, single chromatid segregations in mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the polyploid cells with diplochromosomes were shown to segregate by bipolar mitosis into genome-reduced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sister pairs separated from each other and moved as a genomic group of two-chromatid chromosomes to the poles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A tetraploid cell thus became reduced to two diploid cells (i.e., G2-4c in G1), which in the next mitosis could either restore the previous diplochromosomal status and ploidy level or cycle as diploid mitotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The polyploid cells that are programmed for genome reductional division become part of the senescent cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In such populations, there is depolyploidization into multinucleated cells (MNCs) that can spawn genome-reduced mitotic offspring cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These facts are relevant to neoplasticity-associated cytopathologies such as 4n cells as intermediates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, MNCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343641" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">human papillomavirus infections</z:e>, and radiation-associated cell changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On a cell population level, the bipolar genome reductional division is a source for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo>, generating a continued mixture of polyploid and genome-reduced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The only other known case is in the mosquito, but the phenomenon is likely more common than has been thought </plain></SENT>
