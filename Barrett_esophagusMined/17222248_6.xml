<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, one of the inhibited enzymes, is putatively involved in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine a possible association between COX-2 protein expression and the development and progression of the Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence and the type and degree of associated inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Squamous epithelium, metaplastic, low-grade, high-grade dysplastic lesions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue of 49 resection specimens from patients with Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were immunohistochemically analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Active and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory reactions were classified according to the Updated Sydney System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the Barrett's sequence, a significant progressive increase in COX-2 expression was identified (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant differences were detected between squamous epithelium and Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.001) and from low- to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Active and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were significantly different between squamous epithelium and Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.0001), but not during further progression in the sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increasing COX-2 expression in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is significantly associated with a change in the local inflammatory reaction, but not during further progression through <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This supports the potential of a chemoprevention strategy using COX-2 inhibitors independent of the extent and type of the inflammatory reaction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
