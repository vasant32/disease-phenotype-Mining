<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic surveillance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> currently relies on multiple random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This approach is time consuming, has a poor diagnostic yield, and significant interobserver variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elastic scattering spectroscopy is a real time in vivo optical technique which detects changes in the physical properties of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the potential for elastic scattering to detect high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Elastic scattering spectroscopy measurements collected in vivo were matched with histological specimens taken from identical sites within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsies were reviewed by three gastrointestinal pathologists and defined as either "low risk" (non-dysplastic or low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) or "high risk" (high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two different statistical approaches (leave one out and block validation) were used to validate the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 181 matched biopsy sites from 81 patients, where histopathological consensus was reached, were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was good pathologist agreement in differentiating high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> from other pathology (kappa = 0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elastic scattering spectroscopy detected high risk sites with 92% sensitivity and 60% specificity and differentiated high risk sites from <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> with a sensitivity and specificity of 79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If used to target biopsies during endoscopy, the number of low risk biopsies taken would decrease by 60% with minimal loss of accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A negative spectroscopy result would exclude high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with an accuracy of &gt;99.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results show that elastic scattering spectroscopy has the potential to target conventional biopsies in Barrett's surveillance saving significant endoscopist and pathologist time with consequent financial savings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This technique now requires validation in prospective studies </plain></SENT>
