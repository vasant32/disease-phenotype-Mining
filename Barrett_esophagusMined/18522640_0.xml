<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall outcome of the study was that there were no significant differences in primary, secondary, or tertiary outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study is to focus on results related to the method of measuring lesion size called quantitative endoscopy (QE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The design includes a review of a total number of studies and then restricts analyses to the four clinics that enrolled more than four patients each for whom a baseline and 1-year QE study was performed, comparing intra- and inter-patient and clinic differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements include the number of total QEs and adverse events, changes in areas from baseline to 1 year and other intervals, classification of Barrett's lesion type with respect to patients, clinics, and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 309 QE studies were completed with no adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in surface area measurements over time for a particular patient are smaller than the differences for randomly selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The complexity mix (as defined by the mix of circumferential, tongues, and islands) of the Barrett's lesions varied with different clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, QE is an efficient, safe, and accurate way to measure the area of Barrett's lesions variation between different clinical sites may be attributable to a subtle type of selection bias at the individual clinics rather than to regional differences </plain></SENT>
