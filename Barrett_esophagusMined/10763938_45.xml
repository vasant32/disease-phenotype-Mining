<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It is unclear whether the gastric cardia is present from birth or is metaplastic and develops as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end, we evaluated the histology of the entire esophagogastric junction in consecutive pediatric autopsies to determine the presence and extent of cardiac mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The entire esophagogastric junction of 33 consecutive pediatric (&lt; or =18 yr) autopsies was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The precise location of the squamocolumnar junction and its relationship to the esophagogastric junction was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slides were evaluated by two pathologists in a blinded fashion to look for cardiac mucosa, characterized by unequivocal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>)-positive mucous glands in a lobular configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sections from the antrum and esophagogastric junction were examined for the presence of Helicobacter pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three cases were excluded due to autolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the 30 remaining patients was 6.3 yr (range: 16 days-18 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A regular-appearing squamocolumnar junction was identified at the esophagogastric junction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac mucosa was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens (mean length: 1.8 mm; range: 1.0-4.0 mm), always on the gastric side of the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between patient age or gender and length of cardiac mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had a known history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and none were taking acid-suppressing medications before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were negative for Helicobacter pylori by Giemsa stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected pediatric patient population with little or no propensity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, a short segment of cardiac mucosa was consistently present on the gastric side of the esophagogastric junction, independent of gender or age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results support the concept that the gastric cardia is present from birth as a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> structure </plain></SENT>
