<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Initial data from the first nine hospitals registering at least 50 patients each with UKBOR were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This involved 2102 Barrett's oesophagus (BO) cases (M1261:F841), mean 234 patients per centre (range 73-636) and M:F ratio 1.5 (range 1.1-2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was an equal geographical distribution of the hospitals, three each in the north of the country (N), Midlands (Mid) and the south of the country (S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The catchment populations varied from 145,000 to 450,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The M:F ratio for N, Mid and S was 1.6, 1.3, 1.7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis in males was 62.0 years (range 53.2-66.3) and in females 67.6 years (range 59.3-73.4), with little geographical variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age distribution varied somewhat between the centres; the peak age for males being 40-49 years in one northern hospital, 60-69 years in seven others and 70-79 years in one hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For females it was 60-69 years and 70-79 years in each of four hospitals, and 80-89 years in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BO diagnosis rate in the under 50s was fairly constant; F mean 14% (range 0-23%); M (eight centres) mean 23% (range 16-27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in one northern centre it was much higher (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Information on patients with a diagnosis of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC) was available from seven centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 59 AC were diagnosed (M44:F15, ratio 2.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall mean rate of AC in BO was 3.6% (range 0.5-7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Minor variations in BO patient characteristics may have been due to the hospitals' different policies on diagnostic and reporting criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the much higher percentage of men under age 50 in the one N centre may reflect a genuine difference in diet and lifestyle, or possibly genetic susceptibility </plain></SENT>
