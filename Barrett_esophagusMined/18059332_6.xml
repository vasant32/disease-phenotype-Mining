<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated alterations of RA biosynthesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, the precursor lesion to oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to determine CYP26A1 expression levels and functional effects in Barrett's associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">Retinoic acid</z:chebi> response element reporter cells were used to determine RA levels in non-dysplastic and dysplastic Barrett's cell lines and endoscopic biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CYP26A1 expression levels, with or without induction by RA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16325">lithocholic acid</z:chebi>, were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CYP26A1 promoter activity was determined by a luciferase reporter construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CYP26A1 was stably overexpressed in GihTERT cells, which were evaluated for gene-expression changes (pathway array and quantitative RT-PCR), cellular proliferation (cytometric DNA profile and colorimetric assay) and invasion (in vitro matrigel assay) with or without the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi> inhibitor ketaconazole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RA levels decreased progressively with the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P&lt;0.05) and were inversely correlated with CYP26A1 gene levels and activity (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CYP26A1 expression was increased synergistically by RA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16325">lithocholic acid</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of CYP26A1 led to induction of c-Myc, epidermal growth factor receptor and matrix metalloproteinase 3 as well as downregulation of tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase 1 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional effects of CYP26A1 overexpression were increased proliferation (P&lt;0.01) and invasion in vitro (P&lt;0.01), which were inhibited by ketaconazole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of CYP26A1 causes intracellular RA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and drives the cell into a highly proliferative and invasive state with induction of other known oncogenes </plain></SENT>
