<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The volunteers serving as controls in those studies were significantly younger than the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> patterns of healthy volunteers aged comparably to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 19 older (8 f, 11 m; median age 51 years) (OV) and 20 younger (10 f, 10 m; median age 25 years) (YV) healthy volunteers without history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> or medication underwent simultaneous 24-hour pH and bile monitoring (Bilitec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects consumed a special diet that did not interfere with bile measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indicators for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> in the stomach and esophagus: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> probe absorption &gt;0.25 in total measuring period (TM), upright position (excluding postprandial periods) (UP) and supine period (SP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences between older and younger volunteers in pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparing the periods of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> exposure of the stomach, the median (lower and upper quartile) percentage of time was OV = 5.7% (1.0-15.0%) and YV = 3.5% (0.1-7.8%) respectively for TM (n.s.), OV = 3.1% (0.7-9.4%) and YV = 0.4% (0.0-7.1%) for UP (n.s.), and OV = 2.1% (0.2-16.7%) and YV = 5.9% (0.0-12.2%) respectively for SP (n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 10/19 older volunteers and in 18/20 younger volunteers, no reflux of bile into the esophagus was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, 4 older volunteers presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> from 4.6 to 51% of the total measuring period in contrast to the younger group with a maximum of 1.3% of TM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No significant differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> into the stomach were distinguishable between younger and older healthy volunteers, but older volunteers more frequently exhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> into the esophagus </plain></SENT>
