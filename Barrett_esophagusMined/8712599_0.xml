<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1983 and 1989, 18 EU were endoscopically identified in 13 (6%) out of 217 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 groups were defined: EU and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> and EU with localized columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first, 4 Wolf's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (WU) were present; in the second, there were 8 Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (BU), 2 Savary's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (SU) and 4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> with intermediary characteristics (IU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 24 h esophageal Ph monitoring demonstrated the reflux pathogenesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients (57%: alkaline reflux) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histomorphological findings of the EU could support the hypotesis that their variety is related to the different stage of the reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EU, started as a peptic lesion on a stratified squamous mucosa (WU), due to an acid, alkaline or mixed reflux, would macroscopically turn into a BU, through intermediary entities (SU, IU), with a progressive extension of columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to the adjacent epithelium and walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It's not possible to exclude the primitive development of the BU in a Barrett's mucosa, because of an alkaline reflux or because of a low mucosa's resistance (specialized columnar epithelium) to a prolonged acid exposure </plain></SENT>
