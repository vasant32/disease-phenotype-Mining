<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> have emerged as a major health care problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic optical coherence tomography is a microscopic sub-surface imaging technology that has been shown to differentiate tissue layers of the gastrointestinal wall and identify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the mucosa, and is proposed as a surveillance tool to aid in management of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system has been demonstrated for classification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The system is composed of four modules: region of interest segmentation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-related image feature extraction, feature selection, and site classification and validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple feature extraction and classification methods were evaluated and the process of developing the CAD system is described in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Use of multiple <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> images to classify a single site was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 96 EOCT image-biopsy pairs (63 non-dysplastic, 26 low-grade and 7 high-grade dysplastic biopsy sites) from a previously described clinical study were analyzed using the CAD system, yielding an accuracy of 84% for classification of non-dysplastic vs. dysplastic BE tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results motivate continued development of CAD to potentially enable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32399">EOCT</z:chebi> surveillance of large surface areas of Barrett's mucosa to identify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
