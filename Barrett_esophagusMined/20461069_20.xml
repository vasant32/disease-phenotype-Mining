<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Published data on the natural history of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) are inconsistent and difficult to interpret </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the natural history of LGD in a large community-based cohort of BE patients after reviewing the original histological diagnosis by an expert panel of pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Histopathology reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with LGD between 2000 and 2006 in six non-university hospitals were reviewed by two expert pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This panel diagnosis was subsequently compared with the histological outcome during prospective endoscopic follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A diagnosis of LGD was made in 147 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After pathology review, 85% of the patients were downstaged to non-dysplastic BE (NDBE) or to indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In only 15% of the patients was the initial diagnosis LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic follow-up was carried out in 83.6% of patients, with a mean follow-up of 51.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients with a consensus diagnosis of LGD, the cumulative risk of progressing to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (HGD or Ca) was 85.0% in 109.1 months compared with 4.6% in 107.4 months for patients downstaged to NDBE (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of HGD or Ca was 13.4% per patient per year for patients in whom the diagnosis of LGD was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patients downstaged to NDBE, the corresponding incidence rate was 0.49% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LGD in BE is an overdiagnosed and yet underestimated entity in general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients diagnosed with LGD should undergo an expert pathology review to purify this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In case the diagnosis of LGD is confirmed, patients should undergo strict endoscopic follow-up or should be considered for endoscopic ablation therapy </plain></SENT>
