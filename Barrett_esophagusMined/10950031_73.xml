<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to evaluate prospectively the outcome of unifocal HGD (uHGD) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and to determine demographic and endoscopic features predictive of progression to multifocal HGD (mHGD) and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive Barrett's patients in whom uHGD was found at initial endoscopy or during surveillance underwent intensification of medical treatment and repeat endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study endpoint was progression to mHGD or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or HGD in conjunction with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-associated lesion or mass (DALM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HGD diagnosis was confirmed by a second, blinded pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 15 Barrett's patients with uHGD met inclusion criteria and have been prospectively followed for a mean +/- SD of 36.8 +/- 23.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were white and male, with a mean age +/- SD of 61.4 +/- 14.9 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Barrett's length varied from 1 to 13 cm (mean, +/- SD, 6.8 +/- 4 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, eight (53.3%) uHGD progressed: four of 15 (26.7%) to frank <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> between 17 and 35 months of follow-up, two of 15 (13.3%) to mHGD with DALM in conjunction with one or more foci of possible intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> after 12-91 months of follow-up, one of 15 (6.7%) to mHGD with a focus of possible intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> after 14 months, and one of 15 (6.7%) to mHGD after 29 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of 15 (46.7%) uHGD have regressed, five to no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and two to LGD, over the course of follow-up ranging from 24 to 73 months (mean +/- SD, 43.3 +/- 19.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with uHGD regressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fisher's exact test revealed that Barrett's length &gt; or =3 cm and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> approached significance (p &lt; 0.08) in predicting uHGD progression to mHGD/DALM/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, use of the log-rank test to account for differences in length of follow-up show no significance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> or Barrett's length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Barrett's uHGD has a high risk for progressing to mHGD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Justification of an observational approach to uHGD should be discouraged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Markers of uHGD progression, as well as regression, are needed </plain></SENT>
