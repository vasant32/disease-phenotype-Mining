<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because activation of Src tyrosine kinase occurs in malignant and premalignant epithelia of the colon, the aim of this study was to determine whether BE is associated with changes in Src expression and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Src expression and in vitro protein-tyrosine kinase activity in endoscopic tissue samples of BE and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were measured and compared with expression and activity in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus and duodenum from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Src phosphorylation was assessed by immunoblotting using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies and two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Src-specific activity was 3-4 fold higher in BE and 6-fold higher in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> than in control tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different regions of BE from the same patient showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in Src activity compared with the uniform Src activity observed in different regions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus and duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues, Src kinase activity and protein were associated preferentially with the <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100-soluble rather than-insoluble fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting and two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping showed dephosphorylation of Src at Tyr527 in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Src is activated in BE, in part, because of dephosphorylation of Tyr527 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Src activation and its <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> expression occur before development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in BE </plain></SENT>
