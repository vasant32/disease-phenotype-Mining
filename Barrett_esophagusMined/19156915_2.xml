<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous microarray expression profiling studies have shown that genes located on chromosome region 1q21-23 were down-regulated in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and that, among patients with the latter condition, these genes were differentially expressed between responders and nonresponders of preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was unclear whether this difference was due to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or to other genetic alterations at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The status of chromosome 1q LOH was retrospectively evaluated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pretreatment biopsy specimens from 33 patients with locally advanced esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> who were treated with preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, and the findings were correlated with clinicopathologic features and overall survival duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LOH was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis of 7 dinucleotide microsatellite markers that spanned chromosomal region 1q21-23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Allelic loss of chromosome 1q with any marker was found in 66% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; 58% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> demonstrated loss of chromosome 1q21, and 45% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> demonstrated loss of chromosome 1q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with loss of chromosome 1q21.3 had shorter overall survival duration than patients without loss of chromosome 1q21.3 (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in survival with loss of the chromosome 1q21.3 region was also found to be significant in a subset of patients with incomplete pathologic response to preoperative therapy (P = .024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Loss of chromosome 1q was a frequent finding in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cases, and loss of the 1q21.3 region was associated with shorter overall survival duration </plain></SENT>
