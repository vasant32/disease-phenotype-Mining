<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated a similar prevalence of BE in asymptomatic adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of BE in asymptomatic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We invited women scheduled for routine screening colonoscopy (for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) and women undergoing endoscopic examination before bariatric surgery to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients experiencing heartburn symptoms more than once per month were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outpatients at Stanford University and Palo Alto VA Health Care System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Biopsies of the esophagogastric junction in the setting of suspected BE, and completion of symptom and health-related quality of life questionnaires to ensure that subjects were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Identification of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We detected BE in 8 (6%) of 126 subjects, including 3 (5%) of 61 of the women in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening cohort and 5 (8%) of 65 of the women in the pre-bariatric surgery cohort, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had BE measuring 2 cm or less (P = .30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients found to have BE were more likely to be older (mean age 60 years vs 49 years, respectively; P = .04), but there was no difference in mean body mass index, ethnicity, or tobacco or alcohol use between patients with and without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BE was only present in pre-bariatric surgery subjects younger than the age of 50 and was most common in the 61- to 70-year age cohort in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, microscopic reflux changes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> were not more common in the pre-bariatric surgery group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: Small number of subjects with BE detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment BE was detected in 6% of asymptomatic women undergoing screening endoscopic examinations </plain></SENT>
