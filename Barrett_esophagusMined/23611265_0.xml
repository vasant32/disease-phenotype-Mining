<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirty-eight cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (diagnosed using WHO criteria) and 44 cases of proximal gastric mucosa were studied by immunohistochemistry (for CK7, CK20, CK4, CK8, S-100 protein, MUC6, COX2 and bcl-2) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) (for hTERC gene) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathologic features were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The differences in expression of CK7, CK20, MUC6, COX2 and bcl-2 between BE and proximal gastric mucosa with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was however a statistically significant difference in expression of S-100 protein (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of CK7/CK4 and CK7/CK8 in BE showed positive correlation (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, such correlation was not demonstrated in proximal gastric mucosa (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of hTERC gene expression by FISH showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups: 57.9% (22/38) in BE and 13.6% (6/44) in proximal gastric mucosa (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The significance of CK7 and CK20 expression is uncertain in the differential diagnosis between BE and proximal gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, positivity for CK7/CK4/CK8 may support the diagnosis of BE and play a role in distinguishing between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>S-100 protein expression and detection of hTERC gene amplification also contribute to the diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
