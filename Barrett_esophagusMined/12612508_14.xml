<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e> are at increased risk for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently developed ultrathin endoscopes are less expensive and better tolerated than standard endoscopes, they can be used without sedation, and are sensitive and specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness of one-time screening strategies were evaluated for 50-year-old patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux: no screening, standard endoscopy, and screening by an ultrathin endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Markov models were created to simulate the clinical course for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Costs and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry data, published medical data, and expert opinion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, no screening resulted in average costs of $11,785 per person and 19.3226 quality-adjusted life-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrathin endoscopy screening resulted in costs of $12,119 per person and 19.3326 quality-adjusted life-years, yielding a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $55,764 per quality-adjusted life-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using standard endoscopy yielded costs of $12,332 with only slightly greater effectiveness, yielding a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $709,260 when compared with ultrathin endoscopy and $86,833 compared with no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were most sensitive to variation in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the population with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with ultrathin endoscopy is more cost-effective than standard endoscopy, and both strategies appear to improve quality-adjusted life-years among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux at costs that are similar to those of other accepted preventive measures </plain></SENT>
