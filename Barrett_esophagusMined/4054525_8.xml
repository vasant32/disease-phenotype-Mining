<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study describes the clinical, radiologic, esophageal function test, endoscopic, and histologic findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 11 children aged 6-14 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had long-standing symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, which had begun in the first year of life in 10 of the 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 11 patients had mid or upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> and 10 of the 11 required fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most patients had low lower esophageal sphincter pressures and abnormal pH probe studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 6 of the 11 children had the characteristic pink-red appearance of the mucosa at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty endoscopic biopsy specimens taken at multiple levels in the esophagus contained columnar-lined epithelium above the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of the patients had specialized (intestinal-type) epithelium as part of the histologic spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in children is similar to that in adults except that strictures appear to be more common in children, and the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa is not always typical in color </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As in adults, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> appears to be the etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In children beyond infancy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is the most common indication for antireflux surgery at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens should be taken from multiple levels in the esophagus to avoid overdiagnosis and to establish the diagnosis with certainty </plain></SENT>
