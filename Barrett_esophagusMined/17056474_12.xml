<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of members of the IGF binding protein (IGFBP) superfamily in the development of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) and their possible use as markers of disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-10/CYR61 was assessed using Real-Time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry in oesophageal tissues from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BE) patients with and without associated EAC, and in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IGFBP-3, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-10/CYR61 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were up-regulated in Barrett's (n=17) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue of EAC patients (n=18) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue of control subjects without BE or EAC (n=18) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-10/CYR61 proteins was observed in Barrett's, dysplastic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue of EAC cases (n=47 for IGFBP-10; n=39 for IGFBP-3) compared with adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium (p&lt;0.050) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-10/CYR61 expression in Barrett's tissue of EAC cases (n=17) was significantly (p&lt;0.001) higher than in Barrett's tissue of BE patients with no sign of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the results suggest that members of the IGFBP superfamily are up-regulated during oesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and merit further investigation as markers of EAC risk </plain></SENT>
