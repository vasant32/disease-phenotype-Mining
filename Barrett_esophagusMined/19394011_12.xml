<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of esophagectomy and endoscopic therapy in the treatment of early esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Decision analysis model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 5-year study period, endoscopic therapy cost $17,000.00 and yielded 4.88 quality-adjusted life years, compared with $28,000.00 and 4.59, respectively, for esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Varying the recurrence rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> after endoscopic therapy did not change the overall outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity analysis demonstrated, however, that the outcome depended on the rate of lymph node involvement and operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under the best of circumstances in favor of esophagectomy, such as 2% operative mortality, no reduced quality of life after esophagectomy, and a low 5-year survival rate after recurrence of endoscopic ablation, the risk of positive lymph nodes still needed to exceed 25% before esophagectomy became the preferred treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This threshold is twice as high as the values reported for early submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Limited data are available about the long-term outcome of EMR and radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic therapy for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is more effective and less expensive than esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even in early esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with submucosal invasion, endoscopic therapy is a cost-effective alternative to esophagectomy, especially in patients with a high operative risk </plain></SENT>
