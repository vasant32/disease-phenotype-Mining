<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matched histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous epithelium (NS), premalignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), and primary esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EADC) tissues, each defined according to strict clinicopathologic criteria, were obtained from patients who underwent esophageal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using confocal IR microscopy, measurements in the mid-IR spectral region were carried out in transflection configuration, scanning regions of interest in 15 microm steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A multidimensional dataset reporting the spectroscopic properties at each sampled point were analyzed by performing a hierarchical cluster analysis on the second derivative of spectral traces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelia were characterized by a few well defined regions, mostly of large size (tens of contiguous pixels), which correlated with tissue histology, specifically the basal cell layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BE tissues had characteristic regions localized to gland crypts, ranging in size from one pixel to a few tens of pixels, which displayed IR spectra with defined absorption features characteristic of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incorporation of synchrotron light to improve the resolution of individual cells in BE tissues has demonstrated that these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> are associated with goblet cells, the characteristic cell type defining BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas the highly fragmented regions identified in EADC likely reflect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, FTIR mapping would appear to be a potentially useful technique to identify premalignant BE tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The technical feasibility of using FTIR to characterize formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human esophageal tissues demonstrates the potential of this technique to study archival human BE tissue specimens via automated screening techniques </plain></SENT>
