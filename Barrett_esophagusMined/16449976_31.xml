<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC), we determined gene expression profiles of discrete pathological stages of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> using a sequence-verified human cDNA microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty one <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, comprising 24 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagi (NE), 18 BEs, and nine EACs were hybridized to cDNA microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five statistical analyses were used for the data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genes showing significantly different expression levels among the three sample groups were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genes were grouped into functional categories based on the Gene Ontology Consortium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the expression pattern of BE was significantly more similar to EAC than to NE, notwithstanding the known histopathologic differences between BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pattern of NE was clearly distinct from that of EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six genes were the most differentially modulated, according to these microarray data, in BE-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve genes were significantly differentially expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated BE's plus EAC (as a single combined tissue group) vs noncancer-associated BE's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These genes represent potential biomarkers to diagnose EAC at its early stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that molecular events at the transcriptional level in BE are remarkably similar to BE's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding alarmingly implies that BE is biologically closer to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> than to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, and that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk of BE is perhaps higher than we had imagined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that changes modulated at the molecular biologic level supervene earlier than histologic changes, and that BE is an early intermediate stage in the process of EAC </plain></SENT>
