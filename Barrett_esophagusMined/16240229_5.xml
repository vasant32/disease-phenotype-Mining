<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether the increased diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is due to endoscopic reporting and/or a truly increasing rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study reviewed 18,183 endoscopy reports at Temple University Hospital from January 1991 through December 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Annual rates of new cases of endoscopically suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy results were reviewed for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (i.e., specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> increased from 3.22 to 8.28 per 100 endoscopies (257%; P &lt; 0.01) on endoscopy and from 0.67 to 2.76 per 100 endoscopies (412%; P &lt; 0.01) on histology from 1991 to 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four and seven-tenths percent (252/1020) of patients suspected at endoscopy to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were confirmed by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates an increasing rate of new cases of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> on endoscopy and confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> on histology over the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic impression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was about four times higher than the confirmed diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) on histology </plain></SENT>
