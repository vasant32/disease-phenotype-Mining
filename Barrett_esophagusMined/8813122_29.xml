<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether DPC4 inactivation is involved in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, we have analyzed aneuploid populations from biopsies of 35 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who had premalignant epithelium, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 35 patients (46%) had allelic loss at l8q21.1, including 7 patients who had only premalignant tissue present in their Barrett segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, three of four patients (75%) with l8q21.1 loss in their aneuploid populations had the allelic loss present in diploid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis of DPC4 did not reveal any inactivating alterations in the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that allelic losses at l8q are selected during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but the targeted gene remains to be identified </plain></SENT>
