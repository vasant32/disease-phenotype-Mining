<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the high prevalence of short segments of specialised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) at the gastro-oesophageal junction is associated with the rising incidence of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to document the prevalence of short segments of SIM at the gastro-oesophageal junction in patients attending for routine endoscopy and to determine if there was molecular evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> in those with SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 101) were recruited from randomly selected upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy lists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were taken at the squamo-columnar junction to assess the prevalence of SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frozen sections were assessed for molecular evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> using microsatellite analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Squamo-columnar biopsies were suitable for analysis in 95 patients, of whom 20 (21%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> and 2 (2%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (&gt;3 cm of endoscopically apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined oesophagus</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had SIM at the gastro-oesophageal junction, including 2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and 18 with short segments of SIM, one of whom had an associated intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> detected incidentally by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of the 20 cases with SIM exhibited novel microsatellite alleles, 2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and 1 with short segment SIM and an associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 18 patients with short segments of SIM at the gastro-oesophageal junction were significantly older than those without SIM </plain></SENT>
