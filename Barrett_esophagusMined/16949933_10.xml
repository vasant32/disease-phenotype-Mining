<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated a specific pattern of mucin (MUC) core <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) characterized by MUC1 and MUC6 positivity in goblet cells in a proportion of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the pattern of MUC expression associated with the development and progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic mucosal biopsies from 35 patients with BE (10 with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 6 with indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 12 with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> [LGD], and 7 biopsies with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> [HGD]) were immunostained (ABC method) with antibodies against MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC5AC, and MUC6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent and pattern of staining for each marker was evaluated in intestinalized Barrett's epithelium and in the various grades of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, staining was evaluated separately in nondysplastic epithelium adjacent to (&lt;1 cm) and distant from (&gt;2 cm) areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In nondysplastic BE, MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC5AC, and MUC6 stained 40%, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 90% of cases, respectively, in goblet or nongoblet columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to indefinite, LGD and HGD), there was a significant decrease in expression of MUC1, MUC2, and MUC3, and alterations in the staining patterns of MUC5 and MUC6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In fact, MUC1 and MUC3 were entirely absent from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, BE-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> showed an MUC phenotype distinct from that of HGD, with expression of MUC1 and MUC3 in 47% and 67% of cases, and expression of MUC1 in a membranous pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in MUC staining in nondysplastic BE between patients with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alterations in MUC expression occur in the progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, none of these markers helps identify a subgroup of patients at increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
