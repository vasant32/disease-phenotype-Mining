<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have demonstrated reduced chemo- and mechanoreceptor sensitivity to acid infusion and balloon distension, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is mainly a disease of the elderly, making age the possible underlying mechanism for altered pain perception in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine perception thresholds to acid infusion in elderly (&gt;65 yr) versus younger (&lt; or =50 yr) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve elderly and 10 younger patients, matched by length of Barrett's mucosa, were recruited into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients participated in our <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 20 to 60 mg/day and were symptom free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chemosensitivity was determined by a modified acid perfusion test, in which acid perception thresholds were quantified by the lag time to initial typical symptom perception, sensory intensity rating, and an acid perfusion sensory score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of the elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had a negative test, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> younger patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> experienced typical symptom perception during acid infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had significantly longer lag time to initial perception, lower acid perfusion sensory score, and sensory intensity rating in comparison with the younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced chemoreceptor sensitivity to acid perfusion that has previously been demonstrated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may be related to age and not to the presence of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
