<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The histologic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> requires the presence of goblet cells, but this finding may not be the earliest indicator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used immunohistochemistry to detect Cdx2, a transcriptional regulator important in the early differentiation and maintenance of intestinal epithelium, in 134 esophageal biopsy or resection specimens, including 62 with junctional-type epithelium (13 of which had equivocal histologic features of Barrett's epithelium), 34 with Barrett's epithelium without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 38 with Barrett's epithelium and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (13 low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath>, 19 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath>, and 6 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also performed <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-alcian blue staining (pH 2.5) on adjacent sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cdx2 was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> (chiefly high-grade) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, there was diminution or focal loss of detectable protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cdx2 was detected in 20 of 62 cases (30%) of junctional-type epithelium, including 10 of 13 (77%) with equivocal histologic features of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Acid mucin was present in goblet cells and non-goblet columnar cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and in non-goblet columnar cells in 48 of 62 cases (77%) with junctional-type epithelium only, including 17 of 20 (85%) that were Cdx2 positive and 31 of 42 (74%) that were Cdx2 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence that Cdx2 protein is a sensitive marker of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the upper gastrointestinal tract and may be useful in detecting histologically equivocal cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cdx2 is present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, with some loss of protein primarily in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Acid mucin in non-goblet columnar cells is a common feature of Barrett's and junctional-type epithelium and may not always be indicative of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
