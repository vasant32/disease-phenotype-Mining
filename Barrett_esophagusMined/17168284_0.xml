<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We did not find any other cases in the English literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> can be difficult but can be made by tissue examination with a special immunoreaction with several markers to see it expresses S-100, but lacks activity for KER and EMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>S-100 is relatively non-specific as a single immunodeterminant in the diagnostic separation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and anaplastic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, but very sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> react to S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase and HMB-45 antibody (less sensitive than S-100), but not to cytokeratin or CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our case it was obvious that there were two different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> because the MM was negative for cytokeratin, but the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was positive for cytokeratin </plain></SENT>
