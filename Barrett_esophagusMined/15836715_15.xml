<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In contrast to Western countries, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is still believed to be very low in the Far East </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present paper was to assess the prevalence of BE in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine hundred and ninety-two consecutive patients undergoing their first diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopies due to various indications were included from four university hospitals in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Esophagus of each patient was examined during insertion of the endoscope with minimum air inflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From subjects who were found, during endoscopy, to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e>, at least two biopsy samples were taken from the columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients exhibiting specialized columnar epithelium on histological examination were diagnosed as having BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 992 patients, 108 cases (10.9%) were endoscopically diagnosed as short-segment BE, and three cases (0.3%) were endoscopically diagnosed as long-segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, only 36 patients (3.6%) met the histological criteria for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, only one (0.1%) was histologically diagnosed as having long-segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, mostly in a mild degree, was found in 25.0% of the BE group, and 8.6% of the non-BE group (P = 0.0022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernias</z:hpo> were more commonly found in the BE group than in the non-BE group (22.2% vs 8.9%, P = 0.0163) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of BE in Korea appears to be lower than the reported rates from Western countries, it may not be as low as was previously thought </plain></SENT>
