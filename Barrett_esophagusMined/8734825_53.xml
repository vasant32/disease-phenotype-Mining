<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The rapidly rising incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in the United States and western Europe remains unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most persons who develop the disease have had long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms with concomitant Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are, therefore, potentially identifiable for endoscopic screening and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveillance, which should facilitate the early detection of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We undertook these analyses to determine the extent to which the opportunity for early diagnosis and treatment of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> has been realized in the US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specifically, using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the US National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute, we examined changes in stage of disease at diagnosis and in survival between 1973 and 1991 and investigated patient characteristics as predictors of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvements in stage at diagnosis and in survival between 1973 and 1991 were minor and clinically insignificant; overall five-year survival never exceeded 10 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stage of disease at diagnosis was the strongest determinant of subsequent survival; five-year survival with patients with in situ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was 68.2 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This survival advantage persisted up to 15 years after diagnosis and was independent of other prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the opportunity for reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> mortality has been largely unrealized in the US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In light of the increasing incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, efforts should be devoted to identifying those at highest risk of developing Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and to developing cost-effective primary prevention and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveillance methods targetting them </plain></SENT>
