<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Endoscopy is often performed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) disease because of concern about the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether the duration of GER symptoms and/or a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was associated with an increased risk of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was an observational, prospective, community-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients undergoing elective endoscopy because of GER symptoms were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy reports and pathological findings were reviewed to classify patients as having no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, or probable BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations with duration of symptoms and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 701 of 2641 patients (27%) undergoing elective endoscopy had GER symptoms, and 77 of these patients had probable BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with GER symptoms for less than 1 yr, the odds ratio for BE in patients with GER symptoms for 1-5 years was 3.0 and increased to 6.4 in patients with symptoms for more than 10 yr (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was not an independent risk factor for BE (p = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of BE is strongly associated with duration of GER symptoms </plain></SENT>
