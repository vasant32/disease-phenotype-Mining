<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, "short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE)" was proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined immunohistochemical mucin expression and the Ki-67 labeling index (LI) of SSBE, in 5-15 mm lengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 27 SSBE cases showed gastric mucin (MUC5AC, HGM, MUC6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD10 and MUC2, which were markers of intestinal phenotypes, were detected in 13 (48.1%) and 14 (51.9%) of the 27 SSBE cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 LI of SSBE positive cases for CD10 was 23.6 %, while that of SSBE negative cases for CD10 was 14.4 % (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SSBE cases were divided into two groups: one was gastric epithelium type with low Ki-67 LI, and the other was metaplastic epithelium with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and high Ki-67 LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter group was suggested to be more important as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
