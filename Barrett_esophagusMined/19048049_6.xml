<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Owing to its dismal 5-year prognosis in advanced stages, early diagnosis is required in order to improve survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (Barrett's) has been recognised as a pre-cancerous condition generally associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (GORD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Barrett's is defined as the substitution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stratified squamous epithelium of the oesophagus with a columnar cell lining with intestinal-type differentiation; a phenomenon commonly referred to as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical challenges include finding cost-effective ways to identify patients with Barrett's, stratifying them according to their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk and improving the diagnostic potential of endoscopic sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Research has generally focused on identifying tissue biomarkers to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The oesophagus is easily accessible, making it possible to work with human samples, but most studies have been retrospective and underpowered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance programmes are problematic due to sampling bias and the subjective grading of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lack of an animal model has hampered studies to elucidate markers of the transition from Barrett's to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and to test potential therapeutics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a number of in vitro model systems are ripe for further development into more physiologically complete systems </plain></SENT>
