<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two different studies demonstrated alpha-methylacyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> racemase (AMACR) to be a highly specific marker in Barrett's neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reactive atypia was positive in 3/30 cases in these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a retrospective study of early Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> treated with surgery (2000-2005, n=29; M:F=5:1, median age 67 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the role of AMACR expression in reactive and neoplastic lesions associated with the disease of 77 different specimens (60 biopsy and 17 surgical specimens) of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our cohort, 70% of cases demonstrated infiltration of the submucosa, 38% were poorly differentiated, and/or 31% demonstrated lymph vessel infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a multi-tissue array, with reactive and neoplastic samples for each patient to analyze the immunoreactivity of AMACR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Barrett's epithelium that was negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and columnar epithelial cell changes indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n=30) did not demonstrate AMACR immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AMACR immunoreactivity was demonstrated in 27% (8/30) of cases of Barrett's epithelium with columnar epithelial cell changes indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether 91% of cases with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were AMACR-positive and 96% of cases with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were positive for AMACR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, the sensitivity of AMACR expression in low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and subsequent early Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was significantly higher in our study compared with previous data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This might be a new diagnostic marker for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence in Barrett's low-grade neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to investigate this point with well-defined controls having at least 5-years follow-up </plain></SENT>
