<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent advances in laparoscopic and thoracoscopic surgery have made it possible to perform esophagectomy using minimally invasive techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this report was to present our preliminary experience with minimally invasive esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed our experience on eight patients who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy using either laparoscopic and/or thoracoscopic techniques from June 1996 to May 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications for esophagectomy included stage I <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (5), palliative resection (1), Barrett's with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (1) and end stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average age was 68 years (54-82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgical approach to esophagectomy included laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis (n = 4), thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis (n = 1), and laparoscopic mobilization with right mini-thoracotomy and intra-thoracic anastomosis (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversion to mini-laparotomy was required in two patients (25%) to complete esophageal dissection and facilitate gastric pull-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean operative time was 460 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean intensive care stay was 1.9 days (range of 0-7 days) with a mean hospital stay of 13.8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Minor complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> (n = 2) and persistent air leak (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Major complications included cervical anastomotic leak (n = 1), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>delayed gastric emptying</z:mp> requiring pyloroplasty (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no perioperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary experience suggests that minimally invasive esophagectomy is safe and feasible in centers with experience in advanced minimally invasive surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to determine advantages over open esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
