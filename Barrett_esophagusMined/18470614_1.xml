<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this hypothesis is supported by animal models, no human data currently exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a case-control study of persons with a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosis (cases), persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) (without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>), and population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects completed detailed examinations and assays for <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> mutations and serum iron stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 317 cases, 306 GERD patients, and 308 population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and any <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> gene defect (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-1.84), a moderate or severe mutation (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 0.94-2.52), or a severe mutation (C282Y homozygote or C282Y/H63D heterozygote; OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.24-2.48) compared with the population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As expected, gene defects were associated with increased iron stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We can conclude from our findings that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> gene defects, although we cannot exclude small effects </plain></SENT>
