<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the authors' present experience using TNE with our initial, previously reported experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Retrospective review of 611 consecutive patients undergoing TNE was compared with 100 consecutive patients previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most frequent indications for TNE were screening examination of the esophagus in reflux, globus, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> patients (n = 490), biopsy of a lesion in the laryngopharynx, trachea, or esophagus (n = 42), screening examination of the esophagus in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e> patients (n = 45), and evaluation for an esophageal foreign body (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen procedures were aborted secondary to a tight nasal vault </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant findings were found in 50% (294/592) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent findings were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n = 98), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (n = 47), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are similar to those previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TNE is safe, well tolerated by patients, and is easy to learn with a short learning curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TNE may replace radiographic imaging of the esophagus in otolaryngology patients with reflux, globus, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
