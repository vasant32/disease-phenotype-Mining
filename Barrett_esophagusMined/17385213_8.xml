<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Automated assessment of genetic abnormalities detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in brush cytology specimens from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) may enhance the clinical applicability of this methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to validate a novel, automated, proprietary system (CytoVison SPOT AX) for the assessment of FISH abnormalities in BE brush cytology and, subsequently, to use this automated method for screening of a BE surveillance cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FISH with DNA probes for chromosomes 9, 17, and Y, and for the 9p21 (p16), 17q11.2 (Her2/neu), and 17p13.1 (p53) loci was applied on brush cytology specimens from a surveillance cohort of 151 patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Validation of the automated system was performed by comparison of the automated FISH results with manual scores for the first 60 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was 98% concordance between manual and automated FISH analysis with kappa values from 0.49 to 1 for the different probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The loss of 17p13.1 (p53) was observed in only 5% of patients with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND) and in 9% of patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) but increased to 46% in patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) (P &lt; .005; Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes 9 and 17 were observed in 6% of patients with ND, in 21% of patients with LGD, and in 62% of patients with HGD (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten percent of patients with ND had loss of the Y chromosome, which increased to 27% in patients with HGD (P&lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The amplification of 17q11.2 (Her2/neu) was detected in 62% of patients with HGD (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current investigation indicated that the CytoVison SPOT AX is an objective, efficient system for the analysis of DNA-FISH on BE brush cytology and is applicable for analyzing large populations of BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the current study cohort, the loss of 17p13.1 (p53), Y chromosome loss, and polysomy of chromosomes 17 and 9 were correlated with increasing grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
