<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: When saliva, with its high <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> content derived from the enterosalivary recirculation of dietary nitrate, meets acidic gastric juice, the <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> is converted to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25567">nitrous acid</z:chebi>, nitrosative species, and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In healthy volunteers this potentially mutagenic chemistry is focused at the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the location of this <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> chemistry in Barrett's patients during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten Barrett's patients were studied before and after administration of 2 mmol nitrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using microdialysis probes we measured <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>, total <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18022">thiocyanate</z:chebi> concentrations and pH simultaneously in the proximal oesophagus, Barrett's segment, hiatal sac, proximal stomach, and distal stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup, real time nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> concentrations were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, Barrett's segment was the anatomical site with maximal potential for acid catalysed nitrosation, with its median concentration of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> exceeding that of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> in two of 10 subjects before nitrate and in four of nine after nitrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18022">Thiocyanate</z:chebi>, which catalyses acid nitrosation, was abundant at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anatomical sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On entering the acidic Barrett's segment, there was a substantial fall in <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and the lowest <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> to total <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> ratio, indicative of reduction of salivary <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> to nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> at this anatomical site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> were observed to generate nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> concentrations of up to 60 muM within the Barrett's segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The interaction between acidic gastric refluxate and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> rich saliva activates potentially mutagenic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> nitrosative chemistry within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
