<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty four patients (10%) had heterotopic gastric mucosal patches varying in size from 0.2-0.3 cm to 3 x 4-5 cm often immediately below the upper oesophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsies of these patches showed fundic type gastric mucosa with chief and parietal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 10% prevalence is more than twice the highest reported prevalence rate of endoscopically detected patches in the upper oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The characteristic location of these patches at the sphincter area, their uniformly fundic type gastric mucosa, and their poor correlation with clinical and endoscopic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> support the hypothesis that they are congenital in nature </plain></SENT>
