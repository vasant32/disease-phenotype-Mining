<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to determine the role of pancreatic-biliary reflux in the genesis of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The study population comprised 1055 cases (606 men and 449 women; median age, 67 years) who had undergone an upper endoscopy at the Gastroenterology Division of Yokohama City University Hospital between August 2005 and July 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population was composed of 869 cases with intact stomachs and 186 cases with distal-gastrectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence and the progression of Barrett's epithelium were diagnosed based on the Prague C &amp; M Criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlations of clinical factors, including distal-gastrectomy, with the presence and the progression of Barrett's epithelium were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study demonstrated that 42.2% of the total population was diagnosed to have Barrett's epithelium and, in 12.6% of the cases with Barrett's epithelium, the progression of Barrett's epithelium was observed during the median 72 month followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A distal gastrectomy was not significantly correlated with either the incidence or progression of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This lack of association between gastric surgery and Barrett's epithelium suggests that pancreatic-biliary reflux with limited acid is not sufficient for the genesis of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
