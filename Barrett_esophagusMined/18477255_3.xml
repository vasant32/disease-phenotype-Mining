<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates which surgical approach yields the most lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook a retrospective chart review of esophagectomies performed by six surgeons from April 1994 to February 2004 using a prospective general thoracic surgery database at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymph nodes were categorized into one of 17 regions per the American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>, with the total number of lymph nodes, summed over each region, used as the primary outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 517 esophagectomies were performed: 68 transhiatal, 392 Ivor Lewis, and 57 extended Ivor Lewis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mean of 18.7 (SD 8.5) lymph nodes were retrieved with the Ivor Lewis approach as compared to 17.4 (SD 9.2) with the extended Ivor Lewis approach (P = 0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since there was no statistical difference between the number of nodes collected in either Ivor Lewis approach, they were collapsed into one group for comparison with the transhiatal cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly more lymph nodes were collected with an Ivor Lewis approach (mean 18.5, SD 8.6) than with a transhiatal approach (mean 9.0, SD 5.0, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As expected, more thoracic lymph nodes were retrieved with the Ivor Lewis approach [mean 12.4 (SD 7.0) vs. 4.7 (SD 5.3), P &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Ivor Lewis approach was also superior for retrieval of abdominal nodes [mean 6.1 (SD 5.6) versus 4.3 (SD 4.4), P = 0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More lymph nodes are obtained at esophagectomy with an Ivor Lewis than a transhiatal approach </plain></SENT>
