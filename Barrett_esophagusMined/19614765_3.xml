<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Software was developed to produce visualizations of the diagnostic track followed by pathologists as they viewed virtual slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These showed the diagnostic path in four dimensions (x, y, time and zoom), areas studied for &gt;1000 ms, and included pathologists' comments about the areas viewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The system was used to study two trainee and two expert pathologists diagnosing 60 Barrett's oesophageal biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of the diagnostic tracks showed the reason for errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-six cases had an expert consensus diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trainees made errors in 21 and 15 cases, respectively, of which 11 and nine were clinically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Errors were made across the whole spectrum of diagnoses from negative to intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detailed examination of the tracks showed that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> errors there was incorrect interpretation of information; in three errors there was an additional failure to identify diagnostic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tracking with virtual slides is a useful tool in studying diagnosis and error, which has the potential for use in training and assessment </plain></SENT>
