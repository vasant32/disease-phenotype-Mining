<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To identify the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> flora in conditions such as Barrettos esophagus and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> to determine if they are similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal flora </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using broad-range <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rDNA PCR, esophageal biopsies were examined from 24 patients [9 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa, 12 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), and 3 with Barrettos esophagus] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two separate broad-range PCR reactions were performed for each patient, and the resulting products were cloned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one patient with Barrettos esophagus, 99 PCR clones were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two separate clones were recovered from each patient (total = 48), representing 24 different species, with 14 species homologous to known bacteria, 5 homologous to unidentified bacteria, and 5 were not homologous (&lt;97% identity) to any known <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rDNA sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen species were found in the reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients, 5 in the Barrettos esophagus patients, and 10 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis concentrating on a single biopsy from an individual with Barrettos esophagus revealed the presence of 21 distinct <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Members of four phyla were represented, including Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination of each biopsy demonstrated bacteria in intimate association with the distal esophageal epithelium, suggesting that the presence of these bacteria is not transitory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence for a complex, residential <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> population in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e>-related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While much of this biota is present in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, more detailed comparisons may help identify potential disease associations </plain></SENT>
