<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish the incidence and risk factors for progression to high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HG-IEN) or Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BAc) in a prospective cohort of patients with esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> [(BE)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: BE is associated with an increased risk of BAc unless cases are detected early by surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No consistent data are available on the prevalence of BE-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, the ideal surveillance schedule, or the risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 2003, a regional registry of BE patients was created in north-east Italy, establishing the related diagnostic criteria (endoscopic landmarks, biopsy protocol, histological classification) and timing of follow-up (tailored to histology) and recording patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen centers were involved and audited yearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probability of progression to HG-IEN/BAc was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method; the Cox regression model was used to calculate the risk of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HG-IEN (10 cases) and EAc (7 cases) detected at the index endoscopy or in the first year of follow-up were considered to be cases of preexisting disease and excluded; 841 patients with at least 2 endoscopies {median, 3 [interquartile range (IQR): 2-4); median follow-up = 44.6 [IQR: 24.7-60.5] months; total 3083 patient-years} formed the study group [male/female = 646/195; median age, 60 (IQR: 51-68) years] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients progressed to HG-IEN or BAc (incidence: 0.72 per 100 patient-years) after a median of 40.2 (26.9-50.4) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At multivariate analysis, endoscopic abnormalities, that is, ulceration or nodularity (P = 0.0002; relative risk [RR] = 7.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.63-21.9), LG-IEN (P = 0.02, RR = 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-11.43), and BE length (P = 0.01; RR = 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.30) were associated with BE progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the LG-IEN patients, the incidence of HG-IEN/EAc was 3.17 patient-years, that is, 6 times higher than in BE patients without LG-IEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in the absence of intraepithelial neoplastic changes, BE carries a low risk of progression to HG-IEN/BAc, and strict surveillance (or ablative therapy) is advisable in cases with endoscopic abnormalities, LG-IEN or long BE segments </plain></SENT>
