<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The evolutionary dynamics between interacting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cell types are fundamental properties of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> but can be difficult to measure and quantify </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers</z:e> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> mixtures of mutant clones but the direct effect of interactions between these clones is rarely documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The implicit goal of most preventive interventions is to bias competition in favor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells over neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, this is rarely explicitly tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we have developed a cell culture competition model to allow for direct observation of the effect of chemopreventive or therapeutic agents on two interacting cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have examined competition between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cell lines, in the hopes of identifying a system that could screen for potential chemopreventive agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One fluorescently-labeled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal cell line (EPC2-hTERT) was grown in competition with one of four <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cell lines (CP-A, CP-B, CP-C, CP-D) under varying conditions and the outcome of competition measured over 14 days by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>) can help squamous cells outcompete Barrett's cells in this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We are also able to show that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>'s boost to the relative fitness of squamous cells was increased in most cases by mimicking the pH conditions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0599290" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal reflux</z:e> in the lower esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This model is able to integrate differential fitness effects on various cell types, allowing us to simultaneously capture effects on interacting cell types without having to perform separate experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This model system may be used to screen for new classes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention agents designed to modulate the competition between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
