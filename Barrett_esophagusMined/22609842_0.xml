<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: There is considerable discussion regarding "success" rates for laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that, in part, this was a reflection of the outcome variables used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, defined 8 specific variables (within 3 categories) and assessed outcomes for each in a large cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred patients (208 women; median age 52 years old) who underwent LARS at the University of Washington from 1993 to 2008 were given a comprehensive questionnaire to assess various aspects of their outcomes from LARS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> functional studies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> endoscopies performed in these patients in our institution, whether the patients had symptoms or not, and compared the findings to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available preoperative values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up was 92 (6-175) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The success or failure of LARS cannot be defined in a single domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive analysis of outcomes requires categorization that includes symptom response, side-effects, patient's perception and objective measurement of acid exposure, mucosal integrity, and the need for additional medical or surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only then can patients and physicians better understand the role of LARS and make informed decisions </plain></SENT>
