<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The success of endoscopic treatments with BE eradication depends on esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and post-treatment acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Between January 2008 and December 2009, 10 patients were selected for combination treatment of BE using laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery and endoscopic radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retrospective review of preoperative, procedural, and postoperative data was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven study patients had a pathologic diagnosis of nondysplastic BE and 3 patients had a diagnosis of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average length of BE lesions was 6.4 ± 4.8 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedure time averaged 154.4 ± 46.4 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the time of surgery, the mean number of ablations performed was 4.39 ± 1.99 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients were noted to have major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> requiring reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients (80%) had 100% resolution of their BE at their first postoperative endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining 3 patients had a ≥50% resolution and underwent subsequent endoscopic ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic results revealed that 4 patients had substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> to solids and other symptoms were minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients were noted to have complications related to the ablative treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One stricture and 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation of BE at the time of laparoscopic fundoplication is feasible and can effectively treat BE lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A single combined treatment can result in fewer overall procedures performed to obtain BE eradication </plain></SENT>
