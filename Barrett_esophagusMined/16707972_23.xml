<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify and quantify DIS by light microscopy in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively took esophageal biopsies in 70 consecutive pediatric patients, 48 of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained sections <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was scored histologically, and DIS were graded as 0 (absent), + (small and focal), ++ (moderate) or +++ (large and diffuse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A computerized image analysis identified total, cellular and nuclear areas and DIS were quantified as percentage of total minus cellular area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty of 48 GERD patients had histological <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (33 G1, 4 G2, 3 G3, 1 of which with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 40 had DIS (33 +, 4 ++, 3 +++) with 100% interobserver agreement; 15 of 29 (55%) had abnormal pH study (reflux index, 5.7%-36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 30 patients the esophagus was histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DIS values were 2.21% +/- 2.60% (range, 0.11%-12%) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and 0.44% +/- 0.13% (0.2%-0.7%) in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> histology (P &lt; 0.00001), with 0.71% bearing 70% sensitivity and 100% specificity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> versus controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five other children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> unrelated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (eosinophilic, Candida, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016470" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">food allergy</z:e>) also had DIS + to +++, and median DIS area was 5% (1.3%-12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DIS can be detected and evaluated by light microscopy, and the image analysis used provides an objective quantification of DIS and supports the light microscopy evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DIS are a morphological feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in infancy and childhood </plain></SENT>
