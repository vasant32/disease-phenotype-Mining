<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are recognized surrogates for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While few would argue with the "hunt for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>," there is a divide regarding the usefulness of the histological confirmation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in endoscopically apparent long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in 125 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> and to determine the optimal biopsy protocol to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two-hundred ninety-six endoscopies were performed over a 4-yr period in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> segments of mean length 4 cm (range 1-11 cm) at a single center and the resulting biopsies were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> processed with routine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, and a subset (N=92) was subject to alcian blue/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic-acid</z:chebi> Schiff staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using H&amp;E staining, we found that the optimum number of biopsies to diagnose <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was 8 per endoscopy, mean 67.9% endoscopies having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, if only four were taken the yield was 34.7% with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unless more than 16 biopsies were taken (100% yield of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>), no additional significant detection was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using additional alcian blue/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic-acid</z:chebi> Schiff staining only had a marginal benefit, with 5.4% of new cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> being identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is a proximal cephalo-caudal gradient of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, especially with increased chronological age, but doing repeat endoscopies on patients did not increase the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that at least 8 random biopsies is the minimum to be taken and analyzed with conventional H&amp;E staining to diagnose benign <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taking more biopsies did not statistically increase the diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> except when greater than 16 were taken when 100% yield was obtained </plain></SENT>
