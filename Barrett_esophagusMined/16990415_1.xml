<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For gene-expression analysis, which is anticipated to play an important role in classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant conditions</z:e>, PCR-based quantitative assays must have increased diagnostic quantitative accuracy and reproducibility and enable analysis of gene expression in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We developed a reverse transcription-PCR-based quantitative assay that modifies the cDNA sequence to increase the melting temperature of short (56-64 bp) PCR amplicons, enabling their quantification in-tube by homogeneous melting-curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used this method to analyze the expression of 8 genes, 7 potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> markers, and 1 control in samples obtained from 3 colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines, endoscopic biopsy from 8 patients undergoing gastroscopy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and archival FFPE and frozen tissue from 20 patients who underwent surgery for colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The detection limit of the assay, when optimized for FFPE samples, was 100 copies of cDNA, and the dynamic range was 3 orders of magnitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A prototype assay containing a panel of 8 genes displayed good reproducibility compared with the commercially available TaqMan assay (interassay CVs, 5%-20% vs 7%-43%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene-expression analysis was performed successfully in 26 (96%) of 27 endoscopic biopsy specimens, 30 (86%) of 35 archival FFPE samples, and 20 (100%) of 20 archival frozen samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This new technology combines the reproducibility of competitive PCR with accurate quantitative detection by in-tube melting-curve analysis, enabling efficient analysis of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> profiles in samples with small numbers of cells or small amounts of tissue, as well as in archival FFPE tissues </plain></SENT>
