<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus often lack the appropriate amount of heartburn for their severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> by prolonged ambulatory pH monitoring after completely suppressing their heartburn symptoms to determine whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> was underestimated in symptom assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom presented with heartburn, were treated with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (20-60 mg/day) until they were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour pH ambulatory monitoring was performed while they were on <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four of five patients showed persistent abnormal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> after treatment with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients showed abnormally increased supine reflux and two patients had an abnormal increase in both supine and upright reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had complete inhibition of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> by the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (20 mg b.i.d.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treating the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to the endpoint of eradication of heartburn does not insure adequate control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prolonged ambulatory pH monitoring of the esophagus should be conducted to demonstrate that an adequate dose of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> has been given, despite symptomatic improvement </plain></SENT>
