<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the age of 18 months, partial obstruction of the esophagus was apparent, and only semisolid food could be swallowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The signs of obstruction progressed, and the child was admitted urgently, at the age of 4 years, to the authors' department because of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After resuscitation, a <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> swallow and esophagoscopy showed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> of the esophagus between its middle and lower third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through a left thoracotomy incision, 4 cm of the diseased esophagus were resected and continually established by end-to-end esophagoesophageal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathological examination showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> of the esophagus with Barrett's epithelium above and below the stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe periesophagitis was also present because of sealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On follow-up, 6 months later, he has no signs of obstruction and is gaining weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that the presence of Barrett's epithelium in the esophagus in congenital, but the complications, such as stricture formation, are usually caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> irritation, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
