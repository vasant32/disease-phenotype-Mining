<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms occur with similar frequency in males and females, yet <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is less common in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reason for this disparity is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the factors related to Barrett's in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 796 patients (462 male, 334 female) evaluated from 1990 to 2000 for symptoms of reflux were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physiologic abnormalities based on results of endoscopic, motility, pH, and Bilitec testing were identified, and factors related to the presence of Barrett's were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Females with reflux symptoms were significantly less likely to have a positive 24-h pH test, a defective lower esophageal sphincter, or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> than males with reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, females with reflux on the basis of an abnormal 24-h pH test had significantly less esophageal acid exposure than males with reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, esophageal exposure to refluxed acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was similar in females (n = 50) and males (n = 136) with Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariable analysis increased esophageal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> exposure was the only significant factor associated with the presence of Barrett's in male and female patients with reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Females with reflux symptoms have less esophageal acid exposure on average than males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, females and males with Barrett's have a similar severity of reflux, and the female gender does not protect against the development of Barrett's in the setting of advanced reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> exposure is the major risk factor for the presence of Barrett's in patients with reflux disease </plain></SENT>
