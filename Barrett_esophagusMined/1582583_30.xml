<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty five biopsies were taken from different levels of the oesophagus in 25 consecutive patients undergoing endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another group of eight patients with histologically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagitis</z:e> had a biopsy taken from the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A peripheral, membranous pattern was seen predominantly confined to the basal and immediately suprabasal cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the first group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the superficial cells a few granular cytoplasmic structures were positive </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A computerised planimeter was used to determine the proportion of stained areas of squamous cells which were expressed as a percentage of the total area of squamous cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in the area of cells stained for EGF-R between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and inflamed oesophageal mucosa (29.5% and 43.1% respectively) was significant (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
