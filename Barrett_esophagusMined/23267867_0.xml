<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the safety and efficacy of 3 different c-RFA ablation regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a prospective trial of consecutive patients with flat-type BE with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients (45 men; age, 64 Â± 15 y; 28 with prior endoscopic resection) were assigned randomly to groups that underwent c-RFA with a double application of RFA (12 J/cm(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The standard group received c-RFA, with device removal and cleaning, followed by c-RFA; the simple-with-cleaning group underwent c-RFA, with device cleaning without removal, followed by c-RFA; and the simple-no-cleaning group received 2 applications of c-RFA, and the device was not removed or cleaned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was surface regression of BE 3 months later, graded by 2 blinded expert endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Calculated sample size was 57 patients, based on a noninferiority design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median BE surface regression at 3 months was 83% in the standard group, 78% in the simple-with-cleaning group, and 88% in the simple-no-cleaning group (P = .14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RF ablation time was 20 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 18-25 min) for the standard group, 13 minutes (IQR, 11-15 min) for the simple-with-cleaning group, and 5 minutes (IQR, 5-9 min) for the simple-no-cleaning group (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median number of introductions (RFA devices/endoscope) for the standard group was 7, vs 4 for the simple groups (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This randomized, prospective study suggests that c-RFA is easier and faster, but equally safe and effective, when the cleaning phase between ablations is omitted or simplified </plain></SENT>
