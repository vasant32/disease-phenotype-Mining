<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic brush cytology is a promising surveillance technique for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ancillary markers are sought to increase the sensitivity of cytology and allow identification of patients at increased risk for disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine if there are specific genetic changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with associated high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> compared to those without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on cytologic specimens using probes to chromosomes and genomic regions previously described as altered in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied archival brush cytology slides from 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients: 21 with biopsy-proven high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and 19 with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and a minimum 5 years of negative follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Centromeric enumeration probes (CEP) for chromosomes 6, 7, 11, and 12, and locus-specific probes (LSI) for 9p21 (p16 gene), and 17p13.1 (p53 gene) loci along with their corresponding CEP (9 and 17, respectively) were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive FISH result was defined as the presence of cells with &gt;2 CEP signals or with a loss of the LSI signals relative to their corresponding CEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p53 locus loss and/or aneusomy of chromosomes 6, 7, 11, and 12 abnormalities could be detected by FISH in routinely processed endoscopic brush cytology specimens from 95% of biopsy-positive cases with a specificity of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases with cytologic changes classified as indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from patients with a positive biopsy showed changes by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Loss of the p16 locus was seen commonly in patients both with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Selected biomarkers from this study merit further investigation to determine their potential to detect genetic changes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> prior to the development of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
