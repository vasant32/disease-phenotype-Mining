<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results of photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) were retrospectively studied to evaluate the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in ablating HGD and/or IMC complicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients unfit for or refusing esophagectomy (male: 20, mean age: 73.4+/-9.3 years) underwent Porfimer <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> ablation of their HGD (15 patients), HGD plus IMC (10 patients) or submucosal/limited T2 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (6 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean Barrett's length was 5.8+/-2.2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> endoscopic mucosal resection or Nd:YAG laser ablation of mucosal nodularity within Barrett's segment was offered in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (16.1%), photoreactions (12.9%) and stricture requiring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (6.25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> follow-up was 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The long-term results were (a) for HGD/IMC: initial complete response (endoscopic and histologic absence of HGD-IMC) to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was observed in 80.95% of patients, partial response (no endoscopic abnormality, residual IMC-HGD on biopsy) in 9.52%, no response in 9.52% (the recurrence rate after an initial complete response was 17.64%) and (b) for T1b/limited T2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>: two patients died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> after 24 and 46 months, no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was found in two patients after 12 and 19 months and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence was seen in two after 15 and 17 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> is effective in ablating HGD/IMC complicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in the majority of cases, while it also seems to be quite effective in treating T1b/limited T2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
