<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Few previous studies have addressed the agreement between endoscopy and histology regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> in unselected endoscopy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to quantify this agreement, and to study its relation to clinical and endoscopic characteristics in consecutive patients coming for first-time gastroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We invited consecutive patients aged 18-79 years and endoscoped for the first time at endoscopy units exclusively serving defined catchment areas in southeast Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic and clinical data were recorded according to a predetermined protocol, and biopsies were taken from the distal oesophagus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 705 patients included, 17% [95% confidence interval (CI): 14-20] had endoscopically visible columnar mucosa above the oesophagogastric junction and 38% (95% CI: 34-42) had columnar mucosa in at least one biopsy irrespective of the endoscopic finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall concordance between endoscopy and histology regarding presence (or absence) of columnar mucosa above the oesophagogastric junction was 74% (95% CI: 71-77) and the agreement beyond chance, as measured by Kappa (kappa) statistics, was fair, kappa=0.38 (95% CI: 0.32-0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The agreement between the endoscopic assessment and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at biopsy was 86% (95% CI: 83-88), but kappa was only 0.31 (95% CI: 0.21-0.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data were consistent with a lower threshold for macroscopic detection of columnar epithelium above the oesophagogastric junction, when risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The agreement between macroscopic and microscopic assessments of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is no more than fair, and partly dependent on the presence of patient characteristics suggestive of pathology in this region </plain></SENT>
