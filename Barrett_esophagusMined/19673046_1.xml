<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The benefits of SCE lie in its superior protection of the esophagus against further reflux damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was shown that this protection is dependent on ion transport and barrier function of SCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risks of SCE lie in its higher predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An understanding of underlying mechanisms of both processes would benefit considerably from greater knowledge of the structure and function of native SCE - the latter recently advanced by the availability of a telomerase-immortalized, nonneoplastic, human Barrett's cell line (BAR-T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of BAR-T characteristics for growth and differentiation have been described recently, but not its capacity to serve as a model for ion transport and barrier function of SCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To determine the latter, BAR-T cells were grown in enriched media, seeded on permeable supports, and subjected to electrical, biochemical, and morphologic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HET-1A (esophageal epithelial cell line), a nonneoplastic, human esophageal squamous cell line, was also studied for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BAR-T, but not HET-1A cells in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46756">HEPES</z:chebi> Ringer solution behaved as polarized monolayers with the capacity for ion transport and barrier function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was evident electrically with a volt-ohm meter (EVOM),which recorded in BAR-T a resting potential difference of 2.0 +/- 0.2 mV, Isc of 17.4 +/- 3.3 microAmps/cm2 and resistance of 103 +/- 12 ohms x cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, Isc in BAR-T was inhibitable by exposure to Na-free solution, serosal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> 4-acetamido4'-isothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of tight junction genes were determined in BAR-T and HET-1A cells using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, with expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) set at 1 as reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Claudins 1, 4, and 12 were prominently expressed in BAR-T (0.2-0.6 of ZO-1), while claudins 1, 11, and 12 were prominently expressed in HET-1A(0.1-0.8 of ZO-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BAR-T, but not HET-1A, expressed claudins 4, 8, 16, 18, and 23, and HET-1A, but not BAR-T, expressed claudins 11, 15, and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Protein expression of prominently expressed claudins in BAR-T correlated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy localized claudins 1 and 4 in BAR-T to cell membranes and claudin 18, specifically to the tight junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Membrane polarization was also documented in BAR-T by immunolocalization of NaK,ATPase to the basolateral membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>BAR-T, but not HET-1A cells grown on permeable supports form a polarized monolayer with both ion transport and barrier function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Since a number of features of BAR-T are similar to Barrett's SCE and distinct from HET-1A, the BAR-T cell line represents a valuable resource for the study of ion transport and barrier function of nondysplastic SCE </plain></SENT>
