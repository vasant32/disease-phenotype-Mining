<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to compare the duodenogastroesophageal (DGER) reflux with the severity of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and evaluate its response to either medical and/or antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Ninety-six patients with DGER were subjected to thorough history, upper GI endoscopy, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> study, esophageal manometry and 24-hr esophageal pH metry combined with Bilitec 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment was given for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, while Nissen fundoplication was done for 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated after Nissen fundoplication and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age of studied patients was 36.26+/-12.7 years with male to female ratio 2:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chief symptom was heartburn in 73 (76%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upper GI endoscopy revealed, 30 (31.2%) patients had grade I reflux, 30 (31.2%) patients had grade II reflux, 7 patients had grade III reflux, 5 patients had grade VI reflux, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 14 patients (14.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> (HH) in 26 (27%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">Barium</z:chebi> study revealed that, 40 (41.6%) patients had evidence of reflux, while 34 (35.4%) patients had reflux with HH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Esophageal motility revealed the mean LESP (12.7+/-7.6), 68 patients (70.8%) had normotensive body while ineffective esophageal body motility was encountered in 28 (29.1%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Esophageal 24-hr pH study and Bilitec 2000 revealed that 54 (56.2%) patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> with pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, while 42 (43.7%) patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> in alkaline pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment gave excellent to good response in 68 (70.8%) patients, while Nissen fundoplication was done for 28 (29.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic examination 6 months after Nissen fundoplication showed marked improvement in endoscopic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">Barium</z:chebi> study after Nissen fundoplication revealed repair of HH and control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Esophageal motility, 24 hr pH study and Bilitec 2000, after 6 months of Nissen shows high significant increase in LESP, decrease in acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No significant difference between open or laparoscopic fundoplication in LESP, acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DGER in acid medium is more injurious to the esophagus than DGER in alkaline pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The severity of esophageal injury does not correlate with the severity of acid or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> but has a direct correlation with impaired distal esophageal motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment gives satisfactory control of symptoms and healing of esophageal lesion in 70% of DGER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The response to medical treatment does not depend on the severity of esophageal injury but depends on the severity of bile and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Nissen fundoplication in refractory patients, either open or laparoscopic, was effective in control of heartburn in 95% of patients contrary to 50% in mixed symptoms </plain></SENT>
