<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine whether p53 and Rab11a immunoreactivity enhance diagnostic assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0000467'>esophageal dysplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologic sections from 68 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> obtained as part of a 12-institution study were stained with antibodies to p53 and Rab11a, randomized, and coded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mucosal surface layer and deeper glands were scored blindly on a semiquantitative scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlations between p53 and Rab11a scoring with the consensus diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histologic scale was as follows: no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, indefinite, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rab11a staining was most prominent in epithelia negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> but with regenerative features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse relationship between Rab11a staining and findings of surface <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P &lt; .02, chi(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, statistical significance largely reflected loss of Rab11a immunoreactivity in intramucosal and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, which was not a diagnostic dilemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a strong positive correlation of p53 immunoreactivity with an increasing degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (P &lt; .03, chi(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rab11a immunoreactivity did not enhance the diagnostic assessment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The previously reported positive correlation of p53 immunoreactivity with the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> was confirmed </plain></SENT>
