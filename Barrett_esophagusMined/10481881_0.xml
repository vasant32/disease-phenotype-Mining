<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications to operations were considered to be as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo>, reflux-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral paralysis</z:hpo>, failure of conservative treatment in the group of children having no anatomical causes of the reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A method of surgical treatment is proposed including a combination of fundoplication with the posterior gastropexy and fixation of the esophagus to the diaphragm at a distance of 3 cm from the gastric cuff (43 cases, no recurrences) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> with the <z:mp ids='MP_0010884'>esophagus stenosis</z:mp> resection of the altered portion was made followed by plasty with a colonic transplant or local tissues (10 patients with the diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
