<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Acid suppressive therapy has been reported to regress <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still controversial as to whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients respond to this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The factors that might facilitate newly developed squamous re-epithelialization after biopsy excision of Barrett's mucosa were evaluated to identity individuals who may favorably respond to the regression therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and forty-seven biopsy sites from 185 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were examined by endoscopy to investigate possible squamous re-epithelialization of Barrett's mucosa after endoscopic biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before endoscopic examination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were requested to answer questionnaires concerning sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle habits and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242510" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drugs usage</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mucin phenotype, Cdx2 expression, cyclooxygenase-2 expression, cellular proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Barrett's mucosa were immunohistochemically investigated in the biopsy samples taken from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The influence of these factors on the newly developed squamous re-epithelialization of Barrett's mucosa after endoscopic biopsy excision was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By multivariate analysis, the independent factors that favored squamous re-epithelialization were the gastric mucin predominant phenotype of Barrett's mucosa and the absence of Cdx2 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's mucosa with the gastric predominant mucin phenotype, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> administration, the absence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and a low proliferating cell nuclear antigen index were found to be independent predictors for squamous re-epithelialization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The absence of the intestinal predominant mucin phenotype was a positive predictor for newly developed squamous re-epithelialization at the site of biopsy of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with the gastric predominant mucin phenotype may predict a favorable response to acid suppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
