<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, or of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the esophagus, requires light application devices that allow homogeneous and well-defined illumination of the tissue surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such devices must be large enough to induce complete unfolding of the esophagus in spite of esophageal motility and elasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was therefore to determine the optimal diameter of a cylindrical illumination device for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in this organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included nine patients (aged 49-72 years) who underwent panendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flexible transparent hollow tubes with diameters ranging from 13 to 19 mm were successively introduced into the esophagus, and the esophageal wall was viewed from the inside through the tube using a flexible small-diameter endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of folds was counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Observations of the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the esophagus were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The radial location of the folds was also recorded, and defined as follows: anterior wall (up), posterior wall (down), side walls (right, left) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference in the number of folds between the lower and middle parts of the esophagus was noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the upper third had significantly fewer folds (about 30 %) than the other two parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For diameters above 17 mm, this difference was less dramatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The number of such folds was shown to decrease with the increasing diameter of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It appears that 18 mm or more is the optimal diameter for a fixed-geometry cylindrical photodynamic therapy irradiating device for the patient category considered in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It was also observed that most folds were located on the side walls of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
