<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four of the children, the stricture had occurred after esophageal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peptic stricture was diagnosed by esophagography, pH monitoring, manometry, and esophagoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was found in two children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine children underwent transabdominal Nissen fundoplication initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first child of this series, a tight anastomotic stricture had been excised 2 weeks before fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven children became complaint-free within 2 or 3 months after fundoplication without any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, and two children with anastomotic stricture improved after 1 or 2 postoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The condition of one boy, with a 6-year history of tight stricture, did not improve with repeat Nissen and subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological examination showed proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A conservative surgical approach is effective for the management of peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> in children, and direct surgical intervention for stricture should be attempted only in cases of stricture resistant to antireflux surgery with a long history of reflux </plain></SENT>
