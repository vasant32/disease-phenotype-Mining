<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the utility of PET/CT to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> for endoscopic resectability and prognosis in early EAC remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective study to determine the association of PET/CT findings with histopathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion depth and survival outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EAC patients who underwent PET/CT followed by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathology on EMR and survival outcomes from a prospectively maintained database was retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists independently reviewed the PET/CT using the following parameters: detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake intensity, FDG focality, FDG eccentricity, esophageal thickness, maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax), and SUVmax ratio (lesion/liver) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 72 eligible patients: 42 (58.3%) had T1a lesions, and 30 (41.7%) had ≥ T1b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only SUVmax ratio was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion depth (odds ratio = 2.77, 95% confidence interval 1.26-7.73, P = 0.0075) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a cut-off of 1.48, the sensitivity and specificity of SUVmax ratio for identification of T1a lesions were 43.3% and 80.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adjusting the SUVmax ratio to 2.14, 16.7% (5/30) of ≥ T1b patients were identified without any false-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed SUVmax ratio, Charlson comorbidity index, and esophagectomy were independent predictors for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SUVmax ratio (lesion/liver) is more accurate in predicting endoscopic resectability and mortality for EAC than other PET/CT parameters and appears promising as a useful adjunct to the current diagnostic work-up </plain></SENT>
