<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Bile and acid exposures are thought to be major risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has not been fully evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed as a case-control study for determining the possible factors associated with endoscopically suspected esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (ESEM), defined as an endoscopic finding suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 528 patients with ESEM were allocated to the case group, while 528 age- and gender-matched patients without ESEM were allocated to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy and clinical background factors were compared using a multivariate logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> and the severity of gastric mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were independently associated with the presence of ESEM [odds ratio (OR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.69; OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.75-4.33; OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-5.6, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with subjects with neither gastric corpus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo>, although subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> alone were not associated with the presence of ESEM (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.87-2.92), having both gastric corpus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> was strongly associated with the presence of ESEM (OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.40-6.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> was independently associated with the presence of ESEM in the Japanese outpatient population, suggesting a causal association of distal esophageal bile exposure with the development of ESEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm our findings in cases with histologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
