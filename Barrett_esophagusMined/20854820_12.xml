<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angle-resolved low coherence interferometry (a/LCI) uses in vivo depth-resolved nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> measurements to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the clinical utility of a/LCI in the endoscopic surveillance of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing routine surveillance upper endoscopy for BE were recruited at 2 endoscopy centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A novel, endoscope-compatible a/LCI system measured the mean diameter and refractive index of cell nuclei in esophageal epithelium at 172 biopsy sites in 46 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At each site, an a/LCI measurement was correlated with a concurrent endoscopic biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each biopsy specimen was assessed histologically and classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, nondysplastic BE, indeterminate for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The a/LCI data from multiple depths were analyzed to evaluate its ability to differentiate dysplastic from nondysplastic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pathology characterized 5 of the scanned sites as HGD, 8 as LGD, 75 as nondysplastic BE, 70 as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue types, and 14 as indeterminate for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The a/LCI nuclear size measurements separated dysplastic from nondysplastic tissue at a statistically significant (P &lt; .001) level for the tissue segment 200 to 300 Î¼m beneath the surface with an accuracy of 86% (147/172) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A receiver operator characteristic analysis indicated an area under the curve of 0.91, and an optimized decision point gave 100% (13/13) sensitivity and 84% (134/159) specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest a/LCI is accurate in detecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in vivo in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
