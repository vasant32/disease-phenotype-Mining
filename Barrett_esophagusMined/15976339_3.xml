<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between cardia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate whether cytokeratin (CK) expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> can be of value in differentiating between the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumour</z:e> in the oesophagus or stomach were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were taken for routine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One tissue block with representative tissue was selected for immunohistochemical staining (CK7 and CK20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopically located <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus was present in 84 patients (64 men, 20 women; mean age, 68 years; range, 44-91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> located primarily in the gastric cardia was present in 63 patients (42 men, 21 women; mean age, 68 years; range, 42-88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histological diagnosis was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> outside the oesophagus or stomach in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three groups for the immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in group A had definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e>, group B patients had a definite <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> located in the gastric cardia, and group C patients had an obstructing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> distal in the oesophagus at the level of the diaphragm, which could not be passed with the endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Paraffin wax embedded material was available from 122 patients for immunostaining and CK analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in expression or distribution of CK7 or CK20 in the three groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CK phenotyping cannot distinguish between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> arising from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> originating in the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
