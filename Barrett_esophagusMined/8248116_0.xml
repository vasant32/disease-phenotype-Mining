<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen cases of ACA arising in metaplastic columnar epithelium of the distal esophagus were reviewed (12 men; 1 woman; mean age: 59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases had juxtaposed BE of different types with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in five and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ACAs were classified as well differentiated (one case), moderately differentiated (three cases), and poorly differentiated (four cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five cases had mixed features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loss of BGAg H was recorded in four ACA and in one adjacent BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of BGAg B was noted in three ACAs, but in only one case in the adjacent BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incompatible expression of BGAg A and B was present in one case each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anomalous expression of Le a was seen in seven ACAs and adjacent BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Loss of Le b was noted in six ACAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deletion of X was seen in four ACAs and in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Loss of Y was present in the only nonsecretor patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that significant alterations of BGAg occur in BE and in associated ACAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recognition of these antigenic alterations warrants further investigation to define a role for BGAg immunohistochemistry in the surveillance of BE patients at risk of developing ACA </plain></SENT>
