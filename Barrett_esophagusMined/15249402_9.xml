<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined expression levels of several genes important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and compared expression levels with alterations in esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS, DESIGN, AND SETTING: Prospective analysis of 61 patients initially seen with reflux symptoms at a private academic hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Paired esophageal biopsy specimens of squamous epithelium 3 cm above the squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had 24-hour pH monitoring performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cyclooxygenase (COX) 1, COX-2, thymidylate synthase, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), Bcl-2 protein, survivin protein, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), tetraspan (TSPAN), and caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression analysis was performed on snap-frozen, microdissected tissue using a quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear regression and the Pearson product moment correlation were used to relate gene expression to parameters of the 24-hour pH record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression levels of COX-2 correlated positively with the 24-hour pH score (r = 0.25, P =.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the expression of other tested genes and esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also no significant increase in COX-2 expression in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or in those who used <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, these data provide among the first reported correlation of genetic changes and increased esophageal acid exposure in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The changes in gene expression occur before any metaplastic changes in the tissue are apparent, and may in the future be useful in predicting which patients will progress through a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
