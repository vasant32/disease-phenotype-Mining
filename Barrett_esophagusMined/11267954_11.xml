<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because very poor survival rates were reported after exclusive nonradical surgery, the current opinion in the medical community is that very few esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients can anticipate long-term survival after esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study the ability of exclusive radical surgery including very extended lymph node dissection to provide a substantial percentage of patients with long-term survival was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Radical esophagectomy (including removal of the esophageal tube, excision of the potentially involved locoregional lymph nodes, and skeletization of the nonresectable vital organs in the mediastinum and upper abdomen) was attempted in 183 consecutive patients with either Barrett (n = 77) or non-Barrett (n = 106) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus or cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy was subtotal (neck anastomosis) or distal (chest anastomosis) in 103 patients and 80 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Radical esophagectomy (Ro resection) was feasible in 137 patients (75%) whereas 46 patients (25%) in whom a part of the neoplastic process was not resectable (R1 or R2 resection) underwent a palliative esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival, including in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (4.3%), was 35.3% for the whole series, 48% after Ro resection, and 0% after R1 or R2 resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate after any R resection was 57.2% in patients with Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> compared with 20% in patients with non-Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.0001) because of a higher prevalence of nontransmural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (Tis through T2, N0) in the former group (56.5%) compared with the latter group (6.6%) (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival was related closely to the magnitude of both wall penetration and extraesophageal neoplastic spread (Ro, Tis-T1-T2, N0 = 83.5% vs. Ro, T3, N0 = 44.4% vs. Ro, any T, N1 &lt; 5 metastatic lymph nodes = 37% vs. Ro, any T, N1 &gt; or = 5 metastastic lymph nodes = 6.8% vs. R1, R2 = 0%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive radical esophagectomy provides a chance of long-term survival in 35% of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients in whom it is attempted and nearly 50% of those patients in whom it is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of a small number of metastatic lymph nodes does not appear to preclude a long-term favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
