<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Due to interest in cell population <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, the development of new technology and methodologies for studying single cells has dramatically increased in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ideal single cell measurement system would be high throughput for statistical relevance, would measure the most important cellular parameters, and minimize disruption of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a microwell array device capable of measuring single cell oxygen consumption rates (OCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This OCR device is able to diffusionally isolate single cells and enables the quantitative measurement of oxygen consumed by a single cell with fmol/min resolution in a non-invasive and relatively high throughput manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A glass microwell array format containing fixed luminescent sensors allows for future incorporation of additional cellular parameter sensing capabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate the utility of the OCR device, we determined the oxygen consumption rates of a small group of single cells (12 to 18) for three different cells lines: murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7, human epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> cell line A549, and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cell line CP-D </plain></SENT>
