<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, a metaplastic change that is a probable early event in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, were evaluated METHODS: A case-control study was carried out in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population, a large health services delivery organisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Persons with a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> diagnosis (cases) were matched to subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (GORD) without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and to population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects completed direct in-person interviews and antibody testing for H pylori and its CagA (cytotoxin-associated gene product A) protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serological data were available on 318 Barrett's oesophagus cases, 312 GORD patients and 299 population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were substantially less likely to have antibodies for H pylori (OR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.70) than population controls; this inverse association was stronger among those with lower body mass indexes (BMIs &lt; 25, OR = 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.20) and those with CagA+ strains (OR = 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The associations were diminished after adjustment for GORD symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The H pylori status was not an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> compared with the GORD controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> and CagA+ status were inversely associated with a new diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that H pylori colonisation protects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and that the association may be at least partially mediated through GORD </plain></SENT>
