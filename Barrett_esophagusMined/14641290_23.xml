<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The myotomy may induce reflux and the addition of a 360 degrees fundoplication may be hazardous with regard to the remaining aperistaltic esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospectively randomized clinical trial was to compare the outcome for patients with uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> who underwent an anterior Heller's esophagomyotomy (H group) with or without an additional floppy Nissen fundoplication (H + N group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between 1984 and 1995, 20 patients were prospectively randomized to one or other of the performed operations, 10 patients per group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>Esophagitis</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 2) was seen under medical treatment, in 6 of 9 in the H group but none in the H + N group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient in the H + N group required postoperative continuous acid-reducing drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH-studies in median 3.4 years after surgery showed pathological reflux expressed as a percentage of time below pH 4 of 13.1% in the H group compared to 0.15% (P &lt; 0.001) in H + N group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in the H + N group later had an esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients reported significant improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> without symptoms of reflux at 8.0 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Heller's esophagomyotomy eliminates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, but can induce advanced reflux that requires medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The addition of a 360 degrees fundoplication eliminates reflux without adding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in the majority of patients and can be recommended for most patients with uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
