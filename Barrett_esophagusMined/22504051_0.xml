<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is associated with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC), esophagogastric junctional <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EGJA) and esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>), and alcohol consumption with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no analyses have examined how delivery rate modifies the strength of odds ratio (OR) trends with total exposure, i.e., the impact on the OR for a fixed total exposure of high exposure rate for short duration compared with low exposure rate for long duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors pooled data from 12 case-control studies from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> and Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> Consortium (BEACON), including 1242 (EAC), 1263 (EGJA) and 954 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) cases and 7053 controls, modeled joint ORs for cumulative exposure and exposure rate for cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, and evaluated effect modification by sex, body mass index (BMI), age and self-reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites exhibited inverse delivery rate effects, whereby ORs with pack-years increased, but trends weakened with increasing cigarettes/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the examined factors modified associations, except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> where younger ages at diagnosis enhanced smoking effects (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For EAC and EGJA, ORs with drink-years exhibited inverse associations in &lt;5 drinks/day consumers and no association in heavier consumers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>, ORs with drink-years increased, with trends strengthening with greater drinks/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant effect modification, except for EAC and EGJA where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> mitigated the inverse associations (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>, younger ages at diagnosis enhanced drinking-related ORs (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of ORs by pack-years and drink-years, delivery rate effects and effect modifiers revealed common as well as distinct etiologic elements for these diseases </plain></SENT>
