<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of important new developments in the diagnosis, clinical management, and medical, endoscopic, and surgical therapies were described in 2003, and they are summarized here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Most patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> do not have erosive reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> have emerged as major and interacting factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stretch receptors in the fundus are more relevant than tension receptors in triggering transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations and subsequent reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The wireless Medtronic Bravo pH system has been validated as an alternative to conventional pH monitoring and has better tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mainstay of medical therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi>, with as yet no superiority of any one agent over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several endoscopic antireflux therapies aiming at creating an antireflux barrier and reducing or eliminating the need for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> medical therapy or fundoplication have been introduced and validated as feasible, safe, and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It may be possible now to stratify patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> to treatment with either endoscopic therapy or surgery according to the size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and significant pulmonary symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Key developments in the recognition and management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in 2003 will have significant implications for clinical practice or research </plain></SENT>
