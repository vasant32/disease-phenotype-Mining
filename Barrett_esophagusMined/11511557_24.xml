<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bile injury to the gastric mucosa results in a "chemical" <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> are prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine if patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> have more bile related changes in antral mucosa than patients with uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (GORD) or non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> (NUD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were identified by a retrospective search of pathology records and those with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e> who had oesophageal and gastric biopsies taken at the same endoscopy and had no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control biopsies were taken from H pylori negative NUD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antral biopsies were examined "blind" to clinical group and graded for a series of histological features from which the "reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> score" (RGS) and "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> index" (BRI) could be calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reproducibility of these histological scores was tested by a second pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 100 patients with Barrett's, 61 with GORD, and 50 with NUD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RGSs did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BRI values in the Barrett's group were significantly higher than those in GORD subjects (p=0.014) which in turn were higher than those in NUD patients (p=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the frequency of high BRI values (&gt;14) was significantly greater in the Barrett's group (29/100; 29%) than in the GORD (9/61; 14.8%) or NUD (4/50; 8%) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, agreement on BRI values was "poor", indicating limited applicability of this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> have more evidence of bile related <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> than subjects with uncomplicated GORD or NUD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of bile in the refluxate could be a factor in both the development of "specialised" <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
