<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is based on the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) at the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of IM in patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in whom endoscopically a segment of distal esophagus was covered by columnar epithelium (CE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a prospective, descriptive and transversal study, 492 patients (33%) from 1480 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, in whom endoscopic evaluation demonstrated the presence of a short-segment CE measuring less than 3 cm or a long-segment CE measuring more than 3 cm, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From each patient, several biopsy specimens were taken, which were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin and Alcian blue pH 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of 492 cases, 421 patients (86%) presented with a short-segment CE and 71 patients (14%) had a long-segment CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these 71 cases, 38 had a 3-6 cm-length CE, 21 patients had a 6.1-10 cm-length CE and 12 patients had CE more than 10.1 cm in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic short-segment CE was six times more frequent than long-segment CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of IM was 35% among patients with short-segment CE and increased progressively according to the length of CE, being 100% in patients with &gt; 10 cm in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, true short-segment BE was three times more frequent during endoscopic studies than long-segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> in the metaplastic epithelium also increased parallel to the length of the CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>True BE (presence of IM at the columnar epithelium lining the distal esophagus), was present in 13.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> submitted to endoscopic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Short-segment BE is three times more frequent than long-segment BE, and endoscopic and bioptic evaluation is fundamental in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> who exhibit some segment of the distal esophagus lined by columnar epithelium, even if it is &gt; or = 1 cm long </plain></SENT>
