<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the setting of BE can be decreased by a surgical antireflux procedure (SARP) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compared the reported incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in subjects with BE who underwent SARP with those with BE who had medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used MEDLINE to perform a meta-analysis of the English language literature published from 1966 through October 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed abstracts found with the search term "<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>" and the following: "<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>," "<z:hpo ids='HP_0100751'>esophageal neoplasm</z:hpo>," "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi>," "fundoplication," or "antireflux procedure." Study entry criteria included 1) trial or cohort study with a report of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk expressible in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> per patient-year, 2) histologic confirmation of BE and any <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, and 3) adequate description of intervention (medical vs SARP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were abstracted by two reviewers using standardized forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup comparisons were made using only medical management studies published in the last 5 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable regression controlling for subject age, country of origin, and BE length was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We reviewed 1247 abstracts, and 34 met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were a cumulative 4678 patient-years of follow-up in the SARP group and 4906 patient-years in the medical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence rate in the SARP group was 3.8 cancers/1000 patient-years, compared with 5.3 in the medical group (p=0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no significant difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> rates when comparing SARP with medical series reported in the last 5 yr (3.8/1000 patient-years vs 4.2/1000 patient-years, p=0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis controlling for subject age, country of origin, and BE length did not alter these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The reported risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in subjects with BE is low and not significantly decreased by a surgical antireflux procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Antireflux surgery in the setting of BE should not be recommended as an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> measure </plain></SENT>
