<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>p16(INK4a) lesions occur frequently in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> but their role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We detected 9p21 loss of heterozygosity, p16 CpG island methylation, and p16 mutations in biopsies from 57%, 61%, and 15%, respectively, of 107 patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no mutations were found in p14(ARF) or p15, and methylation was found in only 4% and 13%, respectively. &gt;85% of Barrett's segments had clones with one (p16+/-) or two (p16-/-) p16 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both p16+/- and p16-/- clones underwent extensive expansion involving up to 17 cm of esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of established biomarkers in BE, such as 17p (p53) loss of heterozygosity, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, and/or increased 4N (tetraploid) populations, increased from 0% to 20% to 44% in patients whose biopsies were p16+/+, p16+/-, and p16-/-, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Barrett's segment lengths also increased with change in p16 status with a median of 1.5, 6.0, and 8.0 cm for patients with p16+/+, p16+/-, and p16-/- biopsies, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that most Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> contains genetic and/or epigenetic p16 lesions and has the ability to undergo clonal expansion, creating a field in which other abnormalities can arise that can lead to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
