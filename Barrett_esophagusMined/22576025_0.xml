<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM), which is at high risk of progressing to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, has been identified by obtaining biopsy specimens randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnified endoscopy with narrow band imaging (ME-NBI) is reported to be useful for detecting SIM or the intestinal phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of endoscopic brushing followed by ME-NBI for the detection of the intestinal phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsy and brushing samples were taken following endoscopic observation by ME-NBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from the whole sample and microdissected samples, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of SHH, CDX2, and mucin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty patients (32 men, 18 women, average age 67.3 years) with metaplastic columnar epithelium of the lower esophagus were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MUC2 (85 vs. 65 %) and CDX2 (95 vs. 75 %) were detected more frequently in the brushing samples than in the biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MUC2 expression levels were significantly higher in the brushing samples than those in the biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CDX2 and MUC2 expression levels in the brushing samples were significantly higher in the mucosa with tubular/villous pattern observed by ME-NBI than the levels in mucosae with other patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic brushing in mucosa of columnar epithelium with a tubular/villous pattern visualized by ME-NBI is useful to detect the intestinal phenotype </plain></SENT>
