<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The palliative treatment of AC is now currently non-surgical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was: a) to assess early results of palliative surgery; b) to evaluate the results of curative resection with reference to the influence of the extent of gastrectomy and lymph node dissection on early results and long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1979 to 1989, 179 patients (mean age = 60 +/- 12 years) with AC had 45 palliative resections (mean age = 56 +/- 15) and 134 curative resections (mean age = 61 +/- 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight proximal subtotal esogastrectomies (PSOG) and 7 total esogastrectomies (TOG) were palliative; 72 PSOG and 62 TOG extended to the spleen were curative and associated with lymphadenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The operative mortality rate was 8.9% regardless of the palliative or curative intent of resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After palliative resection, the mortality rate was 2.6% (1 case out of 38) after PSOG and 42.9% (3 cases out of 7) after OGT (P = 0.01); the median survival was 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After curative resection, the mortality rate was 12.5% (9 cases out of 72) after PSOG and 4.8% (3 cases out of 62) after extended TOG (P = 0.2); actuarial 5-year survival rate was 42% after PSOG and 39% after extended TOG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that: a) palliative PSOG for AC can be performed with a low mortality; b) resection with extensive lymphadenectomy allows substantial survival regardless of the extent of gastrectomy </plain></SENT>
