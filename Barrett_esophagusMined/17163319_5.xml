<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is being diagnosed increasingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examine possible differences between long segment and short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (LSBE and SSBE) in long-term follow-up on the basis of our histopathology registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients diagnosed histologically between 1990 and 1995 (n = 1071) were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up data from endoscopy with biopsy were sought on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> on initial endoscopic biopsy (n = 1003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 255 individuals (25.4 %) were regarded as drop-outs (201 lost and 54 without further endoscopy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 748 patients with follow up for more than 5 years, 315 had documented LSBE, 246 had SSBE, and 187 had no length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> recorded (NLBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the study cases (male : female ratio 2.1 : 1, mean age +/- SD 60.9 +/- 14.2 years), the biopsy procedure was fully compliant with guidelines in only 32.5 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 5 cases (0.6 %) had visible lesions reported on endoscopy, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 78.2 +/- 35.6 months (range 0-240), 7 new cases of low grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (LGIN) and 15 cancer cases developed, accounting for a yearly incidence of 0.2 % (LGIN) or 0.4 % (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) after an initial negative endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the cases with initial diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were included, this yearly incidence rose to 0.5 % (LGIN), 0.3 % (high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> [HGIN]) or 1.7 % (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences between SSBE and LSBE were only encountered for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The yearly incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> varies between 0.4 % and 1.7 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the limitations of this retrospective and pathology-based study, the observed risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is comparable to that found in other studies, mainly from the US and the UK, and varies between 0.7 % and 1.0 % of yearly incidence </plain></SENT>
