<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This suggests the need to develop methodology to evaluate the occurrence of ultra-distal reflux (1cm above the LES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study was to compare acid exposition in three different levels: 5cm above the upper border of the LES, 1cm above the LES and in the intrasphincteric region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> after Nissen fundoplication with no clinical, endoscopic and radiologic evidence of reflux were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four-channel pH monitoring took place: channel A, 5cm above the upper border of the LES; channel B, 1cm above the LES; channel C, intrasphincteric; channel D, intragastric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of channels A, B and C were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was significant increase in number of reflux episodes and a higher fraction of time with pH &lt;4.0 in channel B compared to channel A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was significant decrease in fraction of time with pH &lt;4.0 in channel B compared to channel C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two cases of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were diagnosed in the studied patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The region 1cm above the upper border of the LES is more exposed to acid than the region 5cm above the upper border of the LES, although this exposure occurred in reduced levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The region 1cm above the upper border of the LES is less exposed to acid than the intrasphincteric region </plain></SENT>
