<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These alterations are also reflected in changes in the protein-expression profiles of the cell types involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To separately investigate the proteomes of selected cell-types we combined laser-capture microdissection (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aims were to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and technical reproducibility of the sampling method, and the biological variability within and between biopsies and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frozen biopsies were cryo-sectioned, samples of around 2000 epithelial or stroma cells microdissected, digested and measured by Orbitrap LC-MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proteins were then identified by MS/MS database search and quantified by label-free analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An average of 366 protein-groups were identified per sample, and more protein-groups were found in epithelial samples than in stromal samples (442 vs 301, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 1254 distinct protein-groups were found, 289 and 88 of them significantly more often in epithelial and stroma samples, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We assessed five different types of reproducibilities (run-to-run, intrabiopsy, biopsy-to-biopsy, experiment-to-experiment, and patient-to-patient) for protein identification and protein quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility of protein identification ranged from 78 to 57%, and standard deviation of protein quantification was on patient-to-patient level four times higher than for run-to-run </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that sampling around 2000 cells requires groups of 32 samples to detect significant, over 10-fold differences in protein abundances and thus creates a successful compromise between throughput and quality of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We therefore believe that this method is suitable for investigating protein-expression profiles during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
