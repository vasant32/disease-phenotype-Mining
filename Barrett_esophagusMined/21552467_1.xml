<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have a significantly increased risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 40-125 times higher than the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since only a small fraction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients will actually progress to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, there is a need to develop markers that may accurately predict which patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> and progress to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> versus patients who will remain histologically stable and have a benign course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This would allow for better risk stratification of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in order to target aggressive surveillance and intervention towards only those patients at highest risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictive biomarkers may thus have significant clinical utility in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in esophageal biopsies is currently the only standard method used in clinical practice as a marker for increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> has not been a accurate or reliable marker for predicting malignant progression and suffers from poor interobserver agreement among pathologists and sampling error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multitude of potential biomarkers have been studied over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the best model for predicting progression to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients will ultimately involve a combination of biomarkers, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> grade and other pathological characteristics, as well as clinical and demographic attributes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this review, we will discuss the most promising biomarkers that have been studied thus far </plain></SENT>
