<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(6) intake on p53 in the molecular pathogenesis of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EADC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each participant, a structured questionnaire was used to obtain detailed sociodemographic and lifestyle risk factors, including diet, from which <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(6) intake were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risks for p53 mutations, p53 mutations at CpG sites, and p53 protein overexpression among EADC cases (n = 54) were calculated using logistic regression with dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(6) intake as predictive variables, adjusting for age, gender, smoking, and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found for patients with EADC who had p53 mutations (n = 21) compared with patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 (n = 33) with respect to selected clinicopathologic variables (age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade, stage, alcohol, or tobacco consumption) and dietary intake of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> or vitamin B(6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant associations were seen between dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(6) intake (highest vs. lowest quartiles) and p53 mutations, p53 mutations at CpG sites (n = 12), and p53 protein overexpression (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that dietary intake of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(6) do not appear to have an effect on p53, suggesting alternative molecular mechanisms underlying esophageal adenocarcinogenesis </plain></SENT>
