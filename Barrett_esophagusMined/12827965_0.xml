<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is not yet well understood, but it is almost certainly a multistep process with both genetic and environmental predispositions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is generally believed to be an intermediate step in the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> a variety of molecular genetic changes has been correlated with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is made by endoscopic visualization and confirmed by biopsy results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main goals of medical therapy for the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are similar for the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, that is to control symptoms of reflux and to heal inflamed esophageal mucosa, obtained by using acid-suppressive therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of endoscopic surveillance of patients with BE is to assess the risk of development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early-stage, potentially curable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An innovative and alternative approach to treatment is the use of mucosal ablative techniques in an attempt to destroy the metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
