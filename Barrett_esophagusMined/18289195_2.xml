<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic certainty is attractive to patients and physicians, to affirm health and to ensure the absence of serious disease, but it is expensive and the majority of patients will have no endoscopic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Empirical treatment with acid suppression in patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is now widely practiced in primary care in many countries but in others, endoscopy is mandatory to receive approval from the payors for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, endoscopy has a role in ruling out an obstructing lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A "once-in-a-lifetime" endoscopy has been proposed as a way to improve our ability to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but cost-models suggest that this strategy is not cost-effective if current surveillance guidelines are followed after the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of routine endoscopic examination in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is therefore questionable and needs better definition in carefully designed trials </plain></SENT>
