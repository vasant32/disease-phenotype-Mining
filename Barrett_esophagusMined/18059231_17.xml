<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to evaluate the role of routine <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in distinguishing BE from CIM in mucosal biopsies and to assess the degree of interobserver variability in recognizing morphologic parameters that are of significance in making this distinction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several morphologic features, including presence of crypt disarray and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, incomplete and diffuse <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, multilayered epithelium, squamous epithelium overlying columnar crypts with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, hybrid glands, and esophageal glands/ducts, were significantly associated with a diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter 3 features were observed exclusively in BE biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, multiple BE-associated morphologic features were often present together in BE but not CIM biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was substantial agreement (kappa=0.6) among expert gastrointestinal pathologists for distinguishing BE from CIM even in the absence of clinical/endoscopic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interobserver agreement in recognition of BE-associated morphologic features ranged from almost perfect for some features like esophageal glands/ducts (kappa=0.83) to slight for multilayered epithelium (kappa=0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings indicate that several morphologic features are helpful in distinguishing BE from CIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combined presence of multiple BE-associated morphologic features can be used in making this distinction with a high degree of accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Larger prospective studies need to be performed to validate these findings and evaluate the reproducibility of this approach in routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
