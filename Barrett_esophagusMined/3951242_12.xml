<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The consensus in the conflict about surgical management of peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> presently favors conservative antireflux procedures with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> rather than resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, emphasis is now shifting to the controversy of conservative surgical treatment versus medical management with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the influence of seven variables on the postoperative result in 160 patients undergoing antireflux operations with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> for peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up is 47 months (range 6 to 240) and the mean age is 57 years (range 13 to 83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred seven patients operated on early in the course of the disease have better results (90% good, 9% fair, 1% poor) than 31 patients having a previous failed operation (52% good, 23% fair, 26% poor) and 22 patients having multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> (45% good, 23% fair, 32% poor) (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative manometry improves results (p less than 0.05), and postoperative reflux has a negative influence on results (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The postoperative lower esophageal sphincter pressure in patients without reflux (17.7 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) is higher than in those with reflux (8.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and is an accurate predictor of the risk of reflux (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative and postoperative sphincter pressures are objective indicators of outcome but because of variability are not predictive (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and the age and sex of patients do not alter outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> did not develop in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> once reflux was eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This information indicates that conservative antireflux operation with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> is the treatment of choice in patients with peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
