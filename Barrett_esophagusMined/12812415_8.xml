<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Biological tissues undergoing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> seem to exhibit changes in the intercellular space that can be sensed using low frequency electrical impedance methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Basically, low frequency electric current flows through this space and its widening as well as the disruption of the tight junction decrease the resistance, facilitating current flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The electrical changes accompanying structural changes from columnar tissue to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in Barrett's metaplastic mucosa and gastric tissue are illustrated using resected tissue from 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and fifty-eight biopsies were analysed, correlating their electrical resistivity (R) at 9.6 kHz and their histopathological interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to non-inflamed non-dysplastic columnar tissue (R = 4.9 ohms m), the results suggest a small but statistically significant decrease of electrical impedance in columnar tissue showing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (R = 4.2 ohms m, p = 0.016) and a larger decrease when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is present (R = 3.4 ohms m, p = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If this method is validated further, this technique could be used to obtain guided biopsies from patients undergoing surveillance programmes for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We aim to refine this technique using a new system with lower frequencies and, possibly, in vitro (cultured cells) and in vivo (rats) models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
