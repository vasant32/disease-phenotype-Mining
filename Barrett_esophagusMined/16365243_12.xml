<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: An evaluation of 92 esophageal samples, including 17 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, 22 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, 22 with indefinite/low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 16 with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and 15 with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were evaluated for MnSOD expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated MnSOD expression using immunohistochemistry and graded it separately on a 2-category ordinal scale in relation to the mucosa and submucosa that ranged from 0 (no staining) to 3 (strong staining) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total grading score of MnSOD immunoreactivity was the addition of mucosa and submucosa intensity, from 0 (no immunoreactivity in any of the anatomic sites) to a maximum score of 6 (strong staining reaction in both of the histoanatomic sites) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Study subjects were recruited from the Barrett's Esophageal Registry at the University of Louisville, Louisville, KY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">Manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase expression in established groups of progressive BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-two samples were evaluated for MnSOD expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of MnSOD was found to be significantly reduced in samples with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (mean score, 1.8), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (mean, 2.2), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (mean, 2.4), and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (mean, 2.4) when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (mean, 3.9; P = .002) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">Manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase expression is significantly reduced in patients with BE with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
