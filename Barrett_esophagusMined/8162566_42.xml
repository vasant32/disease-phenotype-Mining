<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aneuploid cell populations from Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> have a high prevalence of 17p allelic losses, and there is substantial evidence that the target of these losses is the p53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If 17p allelic losses lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, then they should be present in diploid cells from patients who develop <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We detected 17p allelic losses in diploid cells from 10 of 11 patients (91%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who developed aneuploid cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly suggest that 17p allelic losses precede the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in vivo and, therefore, support in vitro evidence for the role of p53 in genetic instability </plain></SENT>
