<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1975 and 1994, 113 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent antireflux procedures at the Mayo Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antireflux procedure was performed more than 3 months after the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's disease</z:e> in 39 patients (34.5%) and during the initial preoperative evaluation in 74 (65.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Uncut Collis-Nissen fundoplication was performed in 69 patients (61.1%), Nissen fundoplication was performed in 16 (14.2%), cut Collis-Nissen fundoplication was performed in 12 (10.6%), Belsey repair was performed in nine (8.0%), Collis-Belsey repair was performed in six (5.3%), and Nissen fundoplication with an anterior gastropexy was performed in one (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was one operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (0.9% mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morbidity occurred in 41 patients (36.3%), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in eight (7.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in six (5.3%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyema</z:mpath> in five (4.4%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in four (3.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in two (1.8%), and wound dehiscence, wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, perforated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo>, and postoperative leak in one each (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up for the 112 survivors of operation was 6.5 years (range 4 months to 18.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excellent or good alleviation of symptoms was obtained in 92 patients (82.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-nine patients (88.4%) are currently alive and 13 (11.6%) have died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients (2.7%) subsequently had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus after the antireflux procedure at 13, 25, and 39 months; two of these died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> in this select group of patients was one in 273.8 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that although antireflux procedures in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> result in long-term control of reflux symptoms, the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> still exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance should therefore be recommended </plain></SENT>
