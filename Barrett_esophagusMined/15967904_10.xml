<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the distal esophagus and at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) has been increasing in the last decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that patients in whom Barrett mucosa can be identified in the surgical specimen have a better prognosis compared with those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has led to the belief that patients with and without Barrett mucosa may represent 2 distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: Distal esophageal-GEJ <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with and without Barrett mucosa share the same origin, but differ only in clinical presentation and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort study in a university tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients and METHODS: Between 1992 and 2002, 215 patients (173 men and 42 women; median age, 66 years; age range, 26-91 years) had esophagogastrectomy for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal esophagus-GEJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical presentation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics, and survival were compared in patients with Barrett mucosa (n = 140) and those without (n = 75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with Barrett mucosa in the specimen had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that were diagnosed earlier; were smaller in size; earlier in stage, with fewer node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>; and had a better 5-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Observed differences in survival between patients with distal esophageal-GEJ <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with and without Barrett mucosa can be explained by earlier diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients without Barrett mucosa have their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> detected later, when the disease is more advanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests the possibility that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> without Barrett mucosa are not of a different origin, but rather are larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that may have overgrown areas of Barrett mucosa </plain></SENT>
