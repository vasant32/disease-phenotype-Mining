<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim in this exploratory study was to characterize the broad changes in gene expression that underlie this histologic progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and assess the potential for using these gene expression changes as a marker predictive of malignant progression in Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Microarray analysis was used to obtain individual gene expression profiles from endoscopic biopsies of nine esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and the Barrett's epithelia from which three of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> had arisen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pooled samples from the Barrett's epithelia of six patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> served as a reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Barrett's epithelia from which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> had arisen differed from the reference Barrett's epithelia primarily by underexpression of genes, many of which function in governing cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes in gene expression were found even in those specimens of Barrett's epithelia from which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> had arisen that lacked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> differed from the Barrett's epithelium from which it had arisen primarily by an overexpression of genes, many of which were associated with tissue remodeling and invasiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers</z:e> without identifiable Barrett's epithelium differed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> that had arisen from a Barrett's epithelium by having an even greater number of these overexpressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Histologic progression from Barrett's epithelium to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is associated with a gradient of increasing changes in gene expression characterized by an early loss of gene function governing differentiation that begins before histologic change; gain in function of genes related to remodeling and invasiveness follows later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This correlation of histologic progression with increasing changes in gene expression suggests that gene expression changes in biopsies taken from Barrett's epithelium potentially could serve as a marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> that could be used to predict risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
