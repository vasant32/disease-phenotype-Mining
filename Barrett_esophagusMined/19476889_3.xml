<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The development of high-resolution (HRM) catheters and software displays of manometric recordings in color-coded pressure plots has changed the diagnostic assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HRM may offer advantages over conventional methods, including improved identification of motility disorders, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and outflow obstruction, and ease interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: HRM studies were obtained in 50 healthy volunteers and 106 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HRM was performed using a 36-channel catheter, with sensors spaced at 1-cm intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Manometric findings were classified into abnormalities of the gastroesophageal barrier and those of the esophageal body and validated by comparison with endoscopic and radiographic diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean time for HRM was significantly lower than that for a conventional method (8.1versus 24.4 minutes; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A structurally defective lower esophageal sphincter (LES) was present in 53 (57.3%) patients, a hypertensive LES in 6 (7.8%), and impaired LES relaxation in 17 patients (16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Validating the LES findings, 86.3% (44 of 51) of patients with a defective sphincter by HRM had radiographic or endoscopic evidence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and 80% (41 of 51) had a positive pH study, endoscopic erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evidence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> by HRM was seen in 33 (56%) patients; a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was seen in 91% (30 of 33) of these on endoscopy and 81% (17 of 21) on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> swallow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients (54.7%) had an abnormal body motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HRM studies are shorter than those using conventional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interpretation is image based, and correlation with objective endoscopic and physiologic findings confirms the accuracy of interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The introduction of HRM is a significant advance in the outpatient evaluation of esophageal function </plain></SENT>
