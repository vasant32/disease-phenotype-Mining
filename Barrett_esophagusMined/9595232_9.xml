<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data from many early series do not support this contention, documenting pulmonary complications in up to 50% of patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in 5%-20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since 1990, we have implemented a management strategy designed to maximize airway protection in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the current incidence of pulmonary complications after transhiatal esophagectomy without thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1990 to 1995, 101 consecutive patients underwent THE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical indications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> (90 patients) and Barrett mucosa with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath> (11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 60.2 +/- 1.2 years; 89 patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two patients were smokers and 26 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists risk score 3 or 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were managed according to a standardized clinical pathway that included overnight mechanical ventilation, chest physiotherapy, video pharyngo-esophagram postoperative day 6 or 7, and graduated post-esophagectomy therapeutic diet after acceptable esophagram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pulmonary complications were classified as major or minor depending upon whether or not a change in therapy was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (10%) had 11 major pulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> requiring drainage (4), exacerbation of COPD (2), and mucus plug requiring bronchoscopy or intubation (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Minor pulmonary complications identified by chest film were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100750'>atelectasis</z:hpo> (97), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> (85), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with major pulmonary complications were older (69.3 +/- 9.8 vs. 59.2 +/- 12.1 years, p &lt; .02) and more likely to have COPD (70% vs. 21%, p &lt; .005) than those with only minor complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were 3 operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; 2 caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and 1 by fungal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> in a patient who had exacerbation of COPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Mean hospital length of stay was 13.1 +/- 1.4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minor pulmonary complications identified by chest film occur in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing THE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Strict adherence to a management protocol designed to maximize airway protection in the postoperative period results in a 10% incidence of major pulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Older patient age and COPD are risk factors for major pulmonary complications after THE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> is uncommon, it remains the most frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after THE </plain></SENT>
