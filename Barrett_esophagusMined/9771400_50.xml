<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, whether in the cardia or the distal oesophagus, has been uniformly defined as specialised columnar epithelium, suggesting a relation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is, however, not clear whether the risk factors associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> are identical at both sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate biopsy specimens obtained below the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) in relation to endoscopic aspect, gastric histology, and clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 423 patients investigated the endoscopic aspect of the SCJ was classified as unremarkable (group I, n = 315) or suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (group II, n = 108) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standardised biopsy specimens from the antrum, corpus, and directly below the SCJ were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was detected at the SCJ in 13.4% of group I patients, where it was significantly associated with gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (odds ratio (OR) 6.96; confidence interval (CI) 2.48 to 19.54) and H pylori (OR 7.85; CI 2.82 to 21.85), and in 34.3% of group II patients where it was significantly associated with reflux symptoms (OR 19.98; CI 6.12 to 65.19), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267055" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erosive oesophagitis</z:e> (OR 12.16; CI 3.86 to 38.24), and male sex (OR 6.25, CI 2.16 to 18.14), but not with H pylori or gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the pathogenesis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the SCJ is not uniform: at an endoscopically unremarkable SCJ it is a sequela of H pylori <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, but coexisting with endoscopic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> it is associated with male sex and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
