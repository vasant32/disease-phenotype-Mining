<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article reviews some of the notable advances over the past year in endoscopic therapy for the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: In 2002 several endoscopic therapies were reintroduced or modified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ablative treatments, including Nd:YAG laser, photodynamic therapy, and thermal contact treatments have been shown to be effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and some early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The addition of endoscopic mucosal resection may improve these therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic stenting remains the dominant endoscopic palliative modality for unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e>, and modifications of this therapy have focused on reducing side effects and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Innovations in endoscopic treatments for strictures and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> have been proposed and may improve outcomes, although probably only marginally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional endoscopic antireflux procedures have been introduced, although the results of long-term studies still need to be published before their place in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> can be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Rather than heralding novel endoscopic therapeutics, 2002 was a year of retooling and refining existing techniques </plain></SENT>
