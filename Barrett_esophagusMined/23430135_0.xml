<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study the histological features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of the lower esophagus and esophago-gastric junction in a German cohort were examined using immunohistochemical staining for MUC, CD10, intestinal and gastric type major tight junction proteins (claudins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies using rat duodenogastric content reflux models have also been performed and data show that most neoplastic lesions of the esophageal glands in humans express gastric mucin phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac type mucosa was the main histological type in the surrounding mucosa of neoplastic lesions; however, most cardiac type mucosa has intestinal type tight junction proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BE with goblet cells has been reported to originate from stem cells located in the basal layer of esophageal squamous cell epithelium in previous models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the cardiac type mucosa seems to develop from the site of the stomach and not from the basal layer of esophageal squamous cell epithelium according to our model </plain></SENT>
