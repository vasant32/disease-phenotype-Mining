<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty asymptomatic volunteers served as controls for both studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In study 1 there were 14 patients without reflux complications, 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> grade I to III, 13 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, and 12 with Barrett's epithelium (6 of whom had a stricture) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of a mechanically defective sphincter increased with the progression of the esophageal injury; 50% in the patients without complications to 84% and 92% in those with stricture or Barrett's epithelium, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a decrease in amplitude of contractions in the distal esophagus was observed in patients with stricture and patients with Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In study 2, these findings were applied in the surgical management of 28 consecutive patients with a reflux-induced stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative motility studies were performed after patients were dilated to 60F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Control of reflux by a Nissen fundoplication gave excellent (86%) to good (14%) results in patients who had relief of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> after dilation or adequate motility, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients with both persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> after dilation and inadequate motility underwent resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transmural presented are helpful in the selection of the optimal surgical procedure for the treatment of dilatable reflux-induced strictures </plain></SENT>
