<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, there is strong evidence that the targets of the 17p and 5q allelic losses are TP53, the gene encoding p53, and APC, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is widely accepted that 5q allelic losses precede 17p allelic losses in the progression to colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data, however, supporting this proposed order are largely based on the prevalence of 17p and 5q allelic losses in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and unrelated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> from different patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the order in which 17p and 5q allelic losses developed during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> by evaluating multiple aneuploid cell populations from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using DNA content flow cytometric cell sorting and polymerase chain reaction, 38 aneuploid cell populations from 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> who had high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or both were evaluated for 17p and 5q allelic losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>17p allelic losses preceded 5q allelic losses in 7 patients, both 17p and 5q allelic losses were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aneuploid populations of 4 patients, and only 17p (without 5q) allelic losses were present in the aneuploid populations of 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In no patient did we find that a 5q allelic loss preceded a 17p allelic loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that 17p allelic losses typically occur before 5q allelic losses during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
