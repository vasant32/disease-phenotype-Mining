<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective cohort study of 109 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at a single tertiary referral center, mucosal patterns visualized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> on NBI-Z were classified into four easily distinguishable types: A, round pits with regular microvasculature; B, villous/ridge pits with regular microvasculature; C, absent pits with regular microvasculature; D, distorted pits with irregular microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NBI-Z grading was compared with the final histopathological diagnosis, and positive (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reproducibility of the grading was then assessed by NBI-expert and non-NBI-expert endoscopists, and interobserver and intraobserver agreement were calculated using kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Per-biopsy analysis: In 903 out of 1021 distinct areas (87.9%) the NBI-Z grading corresponded to the histological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Per-patient analysis: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and NPV for type A pattern (columnar mucosa without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) were 100% and 97% respectively; for types B and C (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) they were 88% and 91% respectively, and for type D (high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) 81% and 99% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inter- and intraobserver agreement: The mean kappa values in assessing the various patterns were 0.71 and 0.87 in the non-expert group; 0.78 and 0.91 in the expert group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has validated a simplified classification of the various morphologic patterns visualized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and confirmed its reproducibility when used by NBI-expert and non-NBI-expert endoscopists </plain></SENT>
