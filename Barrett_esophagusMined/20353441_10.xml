<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current strategies to decrease morbidity and mortality from EAC have focused on identifying and surveying patients with BE using upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An accurate estimate of the number of patients with BE in the population is important to inform public health policy and to prioritize resources for potential screening and management programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the true prevalence of BE is difficult to ascertain because the condition frequently is symptomatically silent, and the numerous clinical studies that have analyzed BE prevalence have produced a wide range of estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to use a computer simulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease model</z:e> of EAC to determine the estimates for BE prevalence that best align with US Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A previously developed mathematical model of EAC was modified to perform this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The model consists of six health states: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), BE, undetected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Published literature regarding the transition rates between these states were used to provide boundaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the one million computer simulations that were performed, these transition rates were systematically varied, producing differing prevalences for the numerous health states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two filters were sequentially applied to select out superior simulations that were most consistent with clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>First, among these million simulations, the 1000 that best reproduced SEER <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence data were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Next, of those 1000 best simulations, the 100 with an overall calculated BE to Detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> rates closest to published estimates were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, the prevalence of BE in the final set of best 100 simulations was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We present histogram data depicting BE prevalences for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> one million simulations, the 1000 simulations that best approximate SEER data, and the final set of 100 simulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Using the best 100 simulations, we estimate the prevalence of BE to be 5.6% (5.49-5.70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Using our model, an estimated prevalence for BE in the general population of 5.6% (5.49-5.70%) accurately predicts incidence rates for EAC reported to the US SEER <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Future clinical studies are needed to confirm our estimate </plain></SENT>
