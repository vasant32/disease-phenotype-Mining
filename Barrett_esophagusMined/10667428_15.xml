<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Acidic mucin-positive nongoblet columnar cells (NGCC) have recently been observed in the surface epithelium of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and distal esophagus in resections from patients with traditional long segment (&gt;3 cm) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the significance of finding acidic mucin-positive NGCC in the surface epithelium of biopsy specimens from the distal esophagus/GEJ region in the absence of goblet cells (GC) remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to determine the significance of mucin histochemical changes in the distal esophagus/GEJ region, we analyzed and compared the types, prevalence, and distribution of neutral and acidic mucins in biopsy specimens obtained from 2 groups of patients: those with (32 patients) and those without (107 patients) GC identified in this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various mucin histochemical stains (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-Ab pH 2.5, HID-Ab pH 2.5, PB/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="32035">KOH</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>) were used to identify neutral mucins, acidic mucins (sialomucins and sulphomucins), and o-acetylated sialomucins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared between the 2 patient groups and correlated with the clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients without GC, patients with GC had a significantly higher male/female ratio and a higher proportion of patients with greater than 3 cm of columnar epithelium within the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Acidic mucin (sialomucin and sulphomucin)-positive NGCC in the surface, foveolar, and glandular epithelium did not show any correlation with any of the clinical, endoscopic, or pathologic features, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024959" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antritis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo>, or length of columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, acidic mucin-positive NGCC correlated strongly with the presence of GC (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, sialomucin-positive NGCC were present in 28 of 32 (88%) patients with GC compared with 31 of 107 (29%) patients without GC (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, sulphomucin-positive NGCC were present in 20 of 32 (62%) patients with GC, compared with 11 of 107 (10%) patients without GC (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the non-GC cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy specimens that stained positively for sulphomucin in surface NGCC (11 specimens), except one, showed staining restricted to the surface of multilayered epithelium, a distinctive type of epithelium that shows morphological, ultrastructural, and cytochemical features of both squamous and columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sialomucin positivity in surface NGCC from the distal esophagus/GEJ region is a sensitive (sensitivity 88%), but nonspecific (specificity 71%), indicator of GC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, sulphomucin expression in NGCC from the same anatomic area is a less sensitive (sensitivity 62%), but more specific (specificity = 90%) marker for the presence of metaplastic epithelium, of either the GC or the multilayered epithelial cell type and thus may represent an early or incomplete form of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
