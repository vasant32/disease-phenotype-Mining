<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> developing within previously documented Barrett's epithelium is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> for many years and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> beginning 21 cm from the incisor teeth was documented by endoscopy one year earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hospitalization was necessitated by an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal bleed</z:e> which was found to be due to an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> at 29 cm from the incisors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the surrounding columnar epithelium nor was there any <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> within the squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case documents that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> can arise de novo within the columnar epithelium despite the hypothesis that this epithelium is present because it is more resistant to acid/peptic damage than squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that some <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in Barrett's epithelium may be due to spontaneous degeneration of the epithelium as this patient had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> was not causing diffuse damage </plain></SENT>
