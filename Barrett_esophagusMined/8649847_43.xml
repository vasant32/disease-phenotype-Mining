<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well established that the progression to human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is characterized by the evolution of clones of cells with accumulated genetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, technical difficulties limit the ability to study this process in some premalignant and malignant conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For example, the progression to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is characterized by the evolution of genetic and cell cycle abnormalities, but it has been difficult to characterize this process completely because of the small size of biopsies and the relative abundance of genetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stromal cells in some esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and premalignant mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have combined flow cytometric cell sorting to obtain purified populations of neoplastic cells with whole genome amplification and analysis of microsatellite polymorphisms to determine the frequency of allelic loss on every nonacrocentric autosomal arm in 20 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and two high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA samples of purified flow-sorted aneuploid and corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue were amplified with a degenerate 15mer primer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aliquots of these reactions were then screened with forty-three highly polymorphic simple sequence repeat markers in PCR-based assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Allelic losses were observed at polymorphic loci in 38 of the 40 chromosome arms that were analysed and the median fractional allelic loss (FAL) observed in the samples was 0.28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The background allelic loss frequency was estimated at 0.23 with the highest rates of loss observed at 17p (100%), 5q (80%), 9p (64%), 13q (43%), 18q (43%) and 1p (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data represent the first comprehensive allelotype of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and show the feasibility of multiloci analyses with small highly purified human biopsy material </plain></SENT>
