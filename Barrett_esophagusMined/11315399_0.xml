<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) characterized by specialized columnar epithelium that contains goblet cells and replaces the squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is found in about 10% of patients with symptomatic reflux disease and more importantly has been associated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arises from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, which is usually not visible during routine endoscopy, therefore extensive random sampling of the entire Barrett's segment should be performed with biopsies in the 4 quadrants every 1 to 2 cm and of any macroscopic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We report the history of a 60-year-old man who was admitted to hospital because of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> not healing despite conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He has suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> for more than 30 years and an antireflux surgical procedure had not resulted in regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, close surveillance could not reveal any dysplastic or malignant lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic fluorescence detection (EFD) after sensitization with 30 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">5-aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> (5-ALA) in this patient demonstrated a selective red fluorescence in a macroscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing area near the already known <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopsies from this fluorescent area showed an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy confirmed the presence of intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
