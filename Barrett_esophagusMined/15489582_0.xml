<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In vitro proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows changes in cell membrane <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> structure associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> to be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magic angle <z:mp ids='MP_0001411'>spinning</z:mp> (MAS) MRS allows small esophageal tissue specimens to be studied directly without the need to extract the tissue, but it is not known how intact the tissue architecture remains after MAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the first prospective MAS MRS study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> using endoscopic biopsies with direct histological correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsies were obtained during surveillance esophagoscopy from Barrett's epithelium and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium in 16 patients (34 samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-resolution MAS MRS was performed at 500 MHz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following MRS, the histology was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A further, separate group of 14 biopsies were examined histologically to assess architectural damage caused by tissue preservation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For squamous and Barrett's epithelium, respectively, metabolite ratios of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>-containing compounds to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> plus phosphocreatine (Cho/Cr) were 1.99 and 5.65 (P &lt; 10) and <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> plus phosphocreatine ratios (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29438">CH3</z:chebi>/Cr) were 4.07 and 7.4 (P &lt; 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in histological preservation between the squamous and Barrett's mucosa without MRS (z = 0.67, P = 0.61), but significant differences were found post-MAS MRS (z = 4.06, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Squamous and Barrett's epithelium can be distinguished metabolically, based on Cho/Cr and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29438">CH3</z:chebi>/Cr ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although MAS does affect the histological architecture in Barrett's epithelium, compared with squamous epithelium, direct histological assessment was possible in the majority of samples </plain></SENT>
