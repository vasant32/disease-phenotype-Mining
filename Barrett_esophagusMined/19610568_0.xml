<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a condition in which an abnormal intestinal-type epithelium called specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) replaces the stratified squamous epithelium that normally lines the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This occurs as a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) which is present in more than 20% of adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is present in 1-2% of the United States population with an estimated prevalence as high as 25% in white males older than 50 yrs without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> predisposes patients to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the most rapidly rising <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> incidence over the last 30 years, with an annual incidence of 0.5% in patients with BE and a survival rate less than 10% in 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of circumferential endoscopic ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> using the HALO360 System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> confirmed within the previous year were treated twice per session with a balloon-based, bipolar radiofrequency ablation device with a pre selected energy of 10 J/ cm2 at 260 W for 10 secs, achieving full thickness ablation of epithelium followed by <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">Omeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg PO BID for 1 month and then, daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months with EGD with biopsy and a 2nd re treatment at 4 month if IM persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 21 Hispanic patients underwent treatment with a gender distribution of 9 female and 10 male, at a mean age of 59.6 years old (SD +/- 12.9) and a mean weight of 161 Lbs (SD +/- 26.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a complete response of 66.7%, 61.9%, 76.2%, 76.2% at 1, 3, 6, and 12 month respectively and a biopsy clearance rate (BCR) of 84.6% and 92.3% at 6 and 12 mo with single treatment and of 62.5% and 50.0% at 6 and 12 month in retreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No complications from the procedure such as strictures or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were reported at 1 year after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the multiple treatment options for BE, especially among ablation techniques, radiofrequency ablation therapy is achieving promising results with a full thickness ablation of Barrett's epithelium in 76.2% of patients without direct injury to the submucosa, avoiding formation of strictures and minimal side effects from treatment </plain></SENT>
