<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> in the established esophagojejunostomy model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) will reduce or eliminate the risk of developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Reflux of duodenal juice as well as gastric acid plays an important role in the pathogenesis of BE and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duodenoesophageal reflux (DER) per se induces these diseases without carcinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether antireflux surgery induces regression of BE and prevents <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred F344 male rats underwent one of following 3 operations: (1) total gastrectomy and esophagojejunostomy to induce DER, followed by killing after 20 (n = 13), 30 (n = 12), and 50 weeks (n = 30); (2) biliary diversion procedure, converted to Roux-en-Y method, to avoid bile regurgitation into the esophagus at 20 (n = 29) and 30 weeks (n = 32) after the operation to induce DER, followed by killing 50 weeks after initial operation; or (3) total gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy followed by killing after 50 weeks served as controls (n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE developed in more than half of the animals exposed to DER for 20 weeks, in more than 90% of rats with DER for 30 weeks, and in 100% of animals exposed to DER for 50 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the incidence and the length of BE, there is no difference between the animals that underwent biliary diversion at 20 (62%) and 30 weeks (94%) and those that had DER for 20 (54%) and 30 weeks (92%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was significantly lower in the rats that underwent the biliary diversion procedure after 30 (19%) and 20 weeks (3%) than in the rats that had DER for 50 weeks (60%) (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the control animals that underwent Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy developed BE and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that the converting procedure from the esophagojejunostomy to induce DER to biliary diversion does not lead to regression of BE but prevents the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the rats </plain></SENT>
