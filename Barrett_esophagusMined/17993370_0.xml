<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the accompanying <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may give information about the etiology of these metaplastic changes and whether there are further criteria which are helpful in differentiating Helicobacter-induced vs. reflux-caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and nine patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> diagnosed in biopsies obtained immediately below the Z-line were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further biopsies were taken from the gastric body and antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were diagnosed as having a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Z-line, or as showing short tongues or segments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> was graded according to the updated Sydney-system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>Metaplasia</z:mpath> was typed using Gomori's-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi>-fuchsin-Alcianblue staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, the active (p=0.0002) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (p=0.0004) at the squamocolumnar junction was higher in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Z-line and frequently accompanied by lymphoid aggregates (p&lt;0.0001) and regular cardia- (p=0.0044) and/or corpus-type glands (p=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pseudogoblet cells were more frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (p=0.0159) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic aspect of the Z-line, the inflammatory pattern, and the type of glands in biopsies from the squamocolumnar junction, as well as the presence of pseudogoblet cells are helpful tools in distinguishing Barrett's mucosa from Helicobacter-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
