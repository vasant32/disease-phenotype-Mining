<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The necessary amount of neoadjuvant chemotherapy within a multimodal therapy concept with following oesophageal resection has never been evaluated so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical course of 122 patients with Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, who <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent a neoadjuvant chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, five fluorouracil and leucovorin and following oesophagectomy, was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pretherapeutic clinical and postoperative histopathological staging, histopathological response, clinical course, recurrence rates and long-term survival were retrospectively analysed and compared to the data of 30 patients, who were included in the same multimodal therapy concept, but who had to cease the chemotherapy early because of toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative pathological staging showed that the response rate correlates with the N and R status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The responding patients benefit from longer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing the two subgroups, we could not find a significant difference in response rate, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> staging, resection rate, long-term survival or pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, postoperative morbidity and mortality did not correlate with severe chemotherapy-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on the necessary number of chemotherapy cycles in terms of a neoadjuvant therapy for Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We could show a similar downstaging effect, a good histopathological response and a comparable ameliorated long-term survival of patients with one compared to patients with three chemotherapy cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A biological selection seems to determine the course of the disease already at this early stage </plain></SENT>
