<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We believe this provides evidence for a new site of isolation, since previous reports of the organism's incidence were confined to skin and lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case 1 is an eight-year-old female with a three-year history of gagging and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Esophagoscopy revealed a mass biopsied as vegetable material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 2 is a 66-year-old retired male with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following back surgery, the patient developed odynophagia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Esophageal biopsies showed ulceration and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> colonies with no evidence of fungus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Case 3 is a 62-year-old male gardener who is also a nail biter </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Material biopsied was consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and evidence of fungi was seen </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>Aspiration</z:hpo>, reflux, and mechanical disruption of the esophageal mucosa are possible predisposing factors in colonization of esophageal lesions by this ubiquitous, normally low virulence organism </plain></SENT>
