<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present correlative immunohistochemical study was to assess the utility of cytokeratin (CK7 and CK20) expression in the diagnosis of short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, particularly its efficacy in differentiating Barrett mucosa from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastric cardia and corpus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups of endoscopic biopsy specimens were examined, including 20 endoscopic biopsy specimens of short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (Group A) and equal number exhibiting Helicobacter pylori associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastric cardia and corpus (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were investigated by immunohistochemistry using the standard ABC method for CK7 and CK20 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis of Barrett CK7/20 and gastric CK7/20 patterns between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The anticipated pattern of reactivity in Barrett mucosa (CK7: strong diffuse positivity in superficial and deep glands; CK20: positivity in surface epithelium and superficial glands) was seen in 2 cases of Group A specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expected gastric pattern (CK7: patchy immunostaining with variable involvement of deep glands; CK20: patchy immunostaining of superficial and deep glands in incomplete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> / absence of CK7 immunoreactivity with strong CK20 staining in superficial and deep glands in complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) was seen in 8 cases of Group B specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The respective sensitivity and false-negativity values of CK7/20 staining for Barrett pattern in Group A were 10% and 90%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These values for gastric pattern in Group B were 40% and 60%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specificity and false-positivity values of both patterns were same (100% and 0%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference for Barrett pattern between the two groups (P = 0.487), while the observation of gastric pattern was significantly higher in Group B than in Group A (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that these hypothesized and recently applied diagnostic criteria involving CK7 and CK20 immunoreactivity are not reliable in distinguishing short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> as seen in gastric cardia and corpus </plain></SENT>
