<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most previous studies of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> have used biopsy material to document cell, gland, and architectural types, leading to inaccurate or incomplete conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study presents data from eight esophagogastrectomy specimens of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, which were evaluated topologically by use of dissecting microscopy, specimen radiography, scanning electron microscopy, and routine histologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was found to be mosaic of cell, gland, and architectural types, showing variable degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and maturation toward intestinal and gastric epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Zonation was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surface mucous, goblet, absorptive, mucous neck, mucous gland, and neuroendocrine cells were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases; Paneth, chief, and parietal cells were found in approximately half </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of villar architecture with lining goblet and absorptive cells is unique and can be used to make a biopsy diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case, only a minute residual focus of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was found, suggesting that the pathogenesis of some cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the lower esophagus and gastric cardia unassociated with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> may be the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the gastroesophageal junction unassociated with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, studied during the same time period, had similar epidemiologic characteristics including mean age, age range, and sex distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multifocal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two of eight cases adenomatous change was present; one of these resembled a villous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> of the colon with malignant degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> thus appears to be important as a precursor of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the region of the lower esophagus and gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The significance of these findings in relation to previous reports is discussed </plain></SENT>
