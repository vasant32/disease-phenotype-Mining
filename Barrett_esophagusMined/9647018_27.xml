<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) is defined as the presence of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) in the distal 2-3 cm of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and heartburn is very common in these patients, the pathophysiology of the development of a short segment of SIM versus a longer segment of Barrett's epithelium is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in short versus long segments of SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 203 consecutive patients undergoing endoscopy with two biopsies performed just distal to the squamocolumnar junction, 28 patients were identified as having SSBE as evidenced by SIM on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two SSBE patients underwent esophageal manometry and 24-h dual pH monitoring, and the results were compared with 18 long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (LSBE) patients and 15 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 24-h pH studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SSBE and LSBE patients were significantly older than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, lower esophageal sphincter pressure was significantly greater in SSBE patients compared with LSBE patients (12.3 +/- 1.6 vs 5.2 +/- 1.0 mm Hg,p &lt; 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LSBE patients had a significantly lower distal esophageal peristaltic amplitude as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> (p &lt; 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 5 cm proximal to the LES, SSBE patients had significantly lower total 24-h pH scores, percent upright and percent supine reflux as compared with LSBE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, when measured at the proximal LES (0 cm), SSBE patients had significantly lower 24-h pH scores when compared with LSBE patients (p &lt; 0.03), whereas percent upright and percent supine reflux were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both LSBE and SSBE patients had a greater degree of GER measured at 5 cm above and just proximal to the LES when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As a group, SSBE patients have more competent LES sphincters and less <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> at 0 and 5 cm above the LES as compared with patients with LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the degree and length of acid exposure in the esophagus are important factors in the pathogenesis of SIM involvement of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
