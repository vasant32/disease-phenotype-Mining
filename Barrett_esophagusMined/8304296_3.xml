<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After follow-up averaging 13 yr, 46 patients were reexamined with endoscopy, biopsy, and manometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the distal esophagus was found in four patients 6, 13, 20, and 23 yr after the myotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These four also underwent ambulatory 24-h pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They had the lowest distal esophageal sphincter pressures (1-5 mm Hg), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four had symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and pathologic pH values (&lt; 4 in the distal esophagus for 32-62% of the total recording time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of heightened risk for the development of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> following cardiomyotomy for esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo>, with increased liability to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus, regular endoscopic surveillance of these patients is advisable </plain></SENT>
