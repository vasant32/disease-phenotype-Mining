<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine if immunohistochemistry (IHC) could be used to monitor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity in oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and pre-malignant (Barrett's) oesophageal tissues, relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8), a transcriptional target of NF-kappaB, was also studied to better understand NF-kappaB functionality; its <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were assessed in oesophageal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IHC was employed using an antibody against the nuclear localisation sequence (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLS</z:e>) of the p65 subunit as well as an antibody against IL-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess NF-kappaB function, changes in gene expression of NF-kappaB controlled genes (IL-8 and I-kappaB) were also assessed in the histological sequence using real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More global expression changes were also studied using membrane arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IHC was effective at monitoring overall NF-kappaB activity and IL-8 abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method also allowed NF-kappaB activity and IL-8 abundance to be pinpointed in specific cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant increases in nuclear NF-kappaB activity and IL-8 abundance across the histological series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analysis also showed consistent up-regulation of IL-8, confirming the IHC data and showing enhanced transcriptional NF-kappaB activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>I-kappaB (another NF-kappaB target) showed down-regulation in dysplastic and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of I-kappaB gene expression may partly explain increased NF-kappaB activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IHC, using antibodies against the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLS</z:e> of p65, may be useful in monitoring overall NF-kappaB activity in oesophageal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As IHC is amenable to high-throughput screening (whereas traditional electrophoretic mobility shift assay methods are not), this may lead to the development of a better screening tool for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
