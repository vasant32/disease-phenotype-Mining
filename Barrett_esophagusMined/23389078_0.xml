<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic therapy has emerged as an alternative to surgical esophagectomy for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE)-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accurate pretreatment staging is essential to ensure an appropriate choice of therapy and optimal long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the frequency with which expert histopathologic review of biopsies combined with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) would alter the pretreatment diagnosis of BE-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients referred to the Vanderbilt <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> Endoscopic Treatment Program (V-BEET) were retrospectively identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic, histopathologic, and endoscopic data were extracted from the medical record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For this study, 29 subjects referred for endoscopic staging of BE fulfilled the entry criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The referral diagnosis was low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) in 3 % (1/29), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) in 62 % (18/29), intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (T1a) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 17 % (5/29), and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 17 % (5/29) of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expert histopathologic review of available referral biopsy specimens altered the diagnosis in 33 % (5/15) of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further diagnostic staging with EMR showed BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 10 % (3/29), LGD in 14 % (4/29), HGD in 34 % (10/29), T1a <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 28 % (8/29), and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 14 % (4/29) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combination of expert histopathologic review and EMR altered the initial diagnosis for 55 % (16/29) of the subjects, with 56 % (9/16) upstaged to more advanced disease and 44 % (7/16) downstaged to less advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The practice of combined expert histopathologic review and EMR alters the pretreatment diagnosis for the majority of patients with BE-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Caution is advised for those embarking on endoscopic or surgical treatment for BE-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in the absence of these staging methods </plain></SENT>
