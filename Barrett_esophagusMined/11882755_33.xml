<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing esophagectomy and gastric tube reconstruction represent a good model for studying the pathophysiology of columnar cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the human esophagus because the cervical esophagus is rarely or never exposed to gastric contents before the surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent manometry, simultaneous 24-hour pH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring, and endoscopy with biopsy 3 to 10.4 years after esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of columnar mucosa in the cervical esophagus was confirmed on histologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings on endoscopy and histology were related to clinical data and the results of pH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring 1 cm proximal to the esophagogastrostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen (46.9%) of the 32 patients had metaplastic columnar mucosa within their cervical esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>Metaplasia</z:mpath> was significantly more common in patients with a preoperative diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The length of metaplastic mucosa correlated significantly with the degree of esophageal acid exposure, but the presence of abnormal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> exposure was unrelated to the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> did not change with increasing time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was found within the columnar-lined segment in three patients 8.5, 9.5, and 10.4 years after esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> had abnormal exposure of both acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, but the presence of combined reflux was not significantly higher in these patients compared with patients with nonintestinalized segments of columnar mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is a common complication after gastric pull-up esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>Metaplasia</z:mpath> is more likely to develop in patients with previous BE than other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>Metaplasia</z:mpath> develops in response to squamous epithelial injury in predisposed individuals </plain></SENT>
