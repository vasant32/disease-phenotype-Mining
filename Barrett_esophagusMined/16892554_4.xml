<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paraffin-embedded endoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumor</z:e> biopsies of 38 patients with advanced esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent two cycles of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy with or without additional paclitaxel (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi>) followed by abdominothoracal esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression levels of 5-FU-metabolism associated genes thymidylate synthase (TS), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> phosphorylase (TP), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR), MAP7, ELF3, as well as of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxane</z:chebi> associated related genes caldesmon, excision cross-complementing genes (ERCC1 and ERCC4) HER2-neu, DNA damage-inducible gene 45 (GADD45) and multidrug resistance genes (MDR1, MRP1) were determined using real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression levels were correlated with the histopathological response to chemotherapy assessed in surgically resected specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responding patients showed significantly higher pretherapeutic expression levels of MTHFR (p = 0.012), Caldesmon (p = 0.016), MRP1 (p = 0.007) and MDR1 (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with high pretherapeutic MTHFR and MRP1 levels had a survival benefit after surgery (p = 0.013 and p = 0.015, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, intratumoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of gene expression of selected genes (TP, DPD, MTHFR, HER2-neu, Caldesmon, ERCC4, MRP1) was additionally verified in 9 untreated Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> by examination of 5 distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> areas and was observed in 12.7% (5.6%-23.5%, CI 95%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that determination of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of a few genes may be useful for the prediction of the success of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
