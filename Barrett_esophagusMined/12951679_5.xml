<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of BE was based on the cytologic presence of goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases were reviewed and categorized into: 1) benign esophageal lesions (125 cases), with 48 cases of Candida (32 cases diagnosed by both techniques and 16 diagnosed only by cytology), 3 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> with only 1 case diagnosed by cytology, and 74 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and/or repair; 2) benign BE (141 cases), with 74 cases (52%) diagnosed by both techniques, 11 cases by cytology only (8%), and 56 cases (40%) by histology only; 3) low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD, 30 cases), with 5 cases (17%) diagnosed with both specimens, one case (3%) by cytology only, and 24 cases (80%) by histology only; 4) high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD, 10 cases), with 8 cases (80%) diagnosed with both specimens, 1 case (10%) by cytology, and 1 case (10%) by histology; and 5) <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (23 cases), with 20 cases (87%) diagnosed with both specimens, 2 cases (9%) by cytology only, and 1 case (4%) by histology only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results support the high degree of diagnostic accuracy of cytology for the diagnosis of Barrett's-associated HGD and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and moderate sensitivity for BE </plain></SENT>
