<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the functions of GRPs suggest that they also may play important roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulated proteins GRP78 (BiP) and GRP94 (GP96) in a series of human esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> to determine their implications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of primary resected esophageal (Barrett) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (n = 137) and corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-gene expression levels of GRP78 and GRP94 were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR after <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein expression analysis was performed with immunohistochemical staining of the cases, assembled on a tissue micorarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with pathologic features (pT, pN, G) and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GRP78 and GRP94 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative gene expression of GRP78 was significantly higher in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (pT1m and pT1sm) as compared to more advanced stages (pT2 and pT3) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue (p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Highly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed also higher GRP78 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels compared to moderate and low differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (p = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with higher GRP78 levels tended to show a survival benefit (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GRP94 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-levels showed no association to pathological features or clinical outcome.GRP78 and GRP94 protein expression was detectable by immunohistochemistry in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between a strong GRP78 protein expression and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stages (pT1m and pT1sm, p = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For GRP94 low to moderate protein expression was significantly associated with earlier <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage (p = 0.001) and less lymph node involvement (p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the patients with combined strong GRP78 and GRP94 protein expression exclusively showed either early (pT1m or pT1sm) or advanced (pT3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stages and no pT2 stage (p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We could demonstrate an association of GRP78 and GRP94 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and behaviour in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of GRP78 may be responsible for controlling local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stages, while high expression of GRP78 and GRP94 in advanced stages may be dependent from other factors like cellular stress reactions due to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> or the hosts' immune response </plain></SENT>
