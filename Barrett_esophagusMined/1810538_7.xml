<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>H. pylori was observed in 31 biopsies (44.3%) of the 70 studied, mainly when the epithelium is of the gastric atrophic-fundic type (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its presence shows no relation to the degree of inflammatory activity and does not seem, therefore, to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the lesion </plain></SENT>
