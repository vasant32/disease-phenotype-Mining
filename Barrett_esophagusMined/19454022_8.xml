<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) allow systematic assessment of preferences by asking respondents to choose between scenarios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a labelled discrete choice experiment with realistic choices to investigate patients' trade-offs between the expected health gains and the burden of testing in surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen choice scenarios were selected based on 2 attributes: 1) type of test (endoscopy and two less burdensome fictitious tests), 2) frequency of surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each test-frequency combination was associated with its own realistic decrease in risk of dying from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A conditional logit model was fitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 297 eligible patients (155 BE and 142 with non-specific upper GI symptoms), 247 completed the questionnaire (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients preferred surveillance to no surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current surveillance schemes of once every 1-2 years were amongst the most preferred alternatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher health gains were preferred over those with lower health gains, except when test frequencies exceeded once a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For similar health gains, patients preferred video-capsule over saliva swab and least preferred endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This first example of a labelled DCE using realistic scenarios in a healthcare context shows that such experiments are feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A comparison of labelled and unlabelled designs taking into account setting and research question is recommended </plain></SENT>
