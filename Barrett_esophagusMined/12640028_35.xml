<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To explore mechanisms whereby Malpighian keratinocytes can transdifferentiate into an intestinal-like epithelium, as observed in the early steps of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) development, long-standing cultures of esophageal keratinocytes derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mouse esophageal explants were developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cells were able to form multilayers and to differentiate on filter support by the formation of differentiated layers of basal cells (cytokeratine 14 positive) on which secondary suprabasal cell layers (cytokeratine 4 positive) spontaneously developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, these cultured cells, referred to as P3E6, reproduced, at least in part, the proliferation and stratification pattern existing in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure to acid pH is known to be a critical factor for BE development, culture medium at pH 3.5 was added into the apical chamber of cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This led to a decrease in the overall number of cells but it did not affect cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, external acid environment triggered expression of the GFP reporter gene fused downstream of the cdx2 intestinal homeogene regulatory sequences in P3E6 transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of the endogenous CDX2 protein, detected by western blot and immunocytochemical analysis, correlated with promoter activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure of esophageal keratinocytes to acid pH induces transcription of cdx2, an intestinal specific homeobox gene known to play a critical role in the differentiation and maintenance of intestinal epithelial functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> acid exposure can modify the fate of P3E6 esophageal keratinocytes towards an intestinal program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This can be a key step in the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> often observed in esophagus-cardia junction </plain></SENT>
