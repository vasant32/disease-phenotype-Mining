<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the past, the treatment for this <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, new techniques, including endoscopic mucosal resection, sometimes replace esophagectomy and are becoming standard procedures in clinical practice, not just in major medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathologists must learn to handle these specimens, which have extensive artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, Barrett mucosa has duplicated stromal layers beneath the mucosa that include a new lamina propria and a new muscularis mucosae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We must be aware of these peculiarities because of staging implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regardless of new technology, the diagnostic approach to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> depends on the light microscopic interpretation, which is not as reliable or consistent as one would wish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hopefully, better diagnostic criteria will arise, and perhaps a new histologic stain or a molecular or genetic test will emerge that complements "our eyeballs." </plain></SENT>
