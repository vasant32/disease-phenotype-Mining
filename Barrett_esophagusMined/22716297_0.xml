<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-one biopsies from 35 ASPirin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">Esomeprazole</z:chebi> ChemopreventionTrial (AspECT) trial patients were given a Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> score (1-5) by a panel of five pathologists using conventional microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three biopsies positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were digitized and rescored blindly by virtual microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic reliability was compared between conventional and virtual microscopy using Fleiss' kappa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was substantial reliability of diagnostic agreement (κ = 0.712) scoring the 61 biopsies and moderate agreement scoring the subgroup of 33 'positive' biopsies with both conventional microscopy (κ = 0.598) and virtual microscopy (κ = 0.436) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inter-observer diagnostic agreement between two pathologists by virtual microscopy was substantial (κ = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of panel consensus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> scores between conventional and virtual microscopy was almost perfect (κ = 0.8769) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, with virtual microscopy there was lowering of the consensus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> score in nine biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic agreement with virtual microscopy compares favourably with conventional microscopy in what is recognized to be a challenging area of diagnostic practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, this study highlights possible limitations for this method in the primary diagnostic setting </plain></SENT>
