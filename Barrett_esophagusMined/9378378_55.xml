<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is acquired by severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> and is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acid suppression or anti-reflux surgery alone do not cause significant regression of the metaplastic mucosa nor reduce the malignant potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have suggested that the combination of mucosal ablation with acid suppression may result in squamous regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To destroy Barrett's mucosa by thermal ablation (in the setting of acid suppression) and so induce squamous regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Sixteen patients with non-dysplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were recruited from a surveillance programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had been on a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: At intervals, non-circumferential areas of columnar mucosa were ablated using the KTP laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Acid suppression was obtained with 40 mg <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple biopsy specimens were obtained for histological examination from ablated areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas of glandular mucosa resulted in squamous regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of treatments required depended on the length of the Barrett's segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients there was evidence of squamous regeneration over remaining Barrett's glands (in some of the post-treatment biopsy specimens) whilst in nine patients <z:mpath ids='MPATH_171'>squamous metaplasia</z:mpath> was seen within Barrett's glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mucosal ablation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> by laser, in the setting of acid suppression, results in squamous regeneration (though some burying of Barrett's glands did occur) </plain></SENT>
