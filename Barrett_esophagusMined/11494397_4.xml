<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Where the flap is completely buried, this becomes almost impossible unless part of the flap is exteriorised or an overlying skin window is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, complicated and often impractical monitoring devices have been advocated, but these have failed to gain widespread acceptance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A simpler solution to this problem has been evaluated in a series of patients using colour duplex Doppler imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This re-appraisal of a previously reported technique has been facilitated by updated technology in diagnostic radiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Duplex Doppler imaging was confirmed as an accurate, non-invasive, and inexpensive tool for the postoperative measurement of blood flow within the pedicles of five buried free flaps in four patients undergoing surgery in our unit </plain></SENT>
