<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has been associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagogastric junction and gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have a higher prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> involving the gastric cardia than those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups of patients were compared for the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1 included 50 patients with well-defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who were being followed in an endoscopic surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 2 consisted of 104 individuals participating in a separate study identifying the prevalence of cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in patients undergoing elective upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups had biopsy specimens taken from the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients in group 2 were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and were excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was defined as specialized columnar epithelium containing goblet cells staining with Alcian blue at pH 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the 50 patients in group 1 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) was 22%, whereas the prevalence in the 93 patients in group 2 (no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) was 24%, which was not a statistically significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant difference between groups still could not be identified when the results were examined with regard to equal number of biopsy specimens taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients in either group had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> identified within the cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> do not have a higher prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastric cardia than those presenting for routine endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastric cardia is a relatively common finding, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that screening biopsy specimens of the gastric cardia in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> be limited to study protocols at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, we believe that these data raise the question of whether a true association exists between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333763" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastric cardia cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
