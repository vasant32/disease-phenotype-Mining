<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, dysplastic foci identified initially may not be relocated subsequently, making chemoprevention studies difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using a special gastroscope, systematic mapping (4-quadrant biopsy specimens at 1-cm intervals) was performed in 22 patients (33 total mappings yielding 700 biopsy specimens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>H&amp;E, immunohistochemistry, and DNA ploidy analysis were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>c-erbB-2 and positive Ki-67 were detected only in dysplastic sites; thus, their detection did not precede morphologically identifiable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and p53 were detected in dysplastic and nondysplastic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p53 was correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and S-phase narrowly missed correlation, while <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was not correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCNA and bcl-2 were ubiquitous, limiting their usefulness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On second maps, epithelial type was reidentified with 81% accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between p53 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sites of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and abnormal biomarkers could be relocated accurately by using endoscopic mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mapping combined with biomarker studies may provide better surveillance and serve as a useful technique in chemoprevention studies </plain></SENT>
