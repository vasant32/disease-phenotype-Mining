<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> of Barrett's epithelium (BE), we assessed the expression of Ki-67 antigen and bcl-2 protein and the occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in metaplastic epithelium with and without regenerative atypia (RA), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To refine our understanding of the epithelial kinetics during the carcinogenic sequence, we performed separate analyses of four different mucosal regions, i.e., surface epithelium, upper and lower crypts, and glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expansion of the proliferative zone was noted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and to a mild degree in epithelium with RA but not in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of bcl-2 protein was seen in the proliferative zone in BE and showed a significant increase in RA but was essentially absent in HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Numerous apoptotic nuclei were seen in HGD, decreasing along the cellular gradient from gland to surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We noted a positive correlation between Ki-67 and bcl-2 in the proliferative zone of BE and RA, whereas a negative correlation was present on the surface of RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 was positively correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the lower crypts of HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 expression was negatively correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions except the proliferative zone of dysplastic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that overexpression of bcl-2 protein is not an important step in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We confirm the upward shift of cellular proliferation in dysplastic epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> that is increased in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> might play a significant role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> by restraining increased cellular proliferation </plain></SENT>
