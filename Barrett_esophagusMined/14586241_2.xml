<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the different endoscopic ways of diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and assess the quality of BE endoscopic reports using a rating grid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three-hundred and forty-six reports concerning BE (1997-2000) were divided into two groups, circular and non-circular BE, and rated on a scale (0 to 20 points) by two readers using a grid to evaluate, in particular, the description of BE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and biopsy practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The score was &gt;=10 points for 129 reports (37.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Points were deducted because of inadequate description of BE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and particularly for a lack of biopsies (54% of reports) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indication of endoscopy (BE monitoring) and the form of medical arrangements (out- or in patients) had a significant effect on the mean score of the reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circular BE (46.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reports) was described with respect to the height of the squamo-columnar junction (Z line) and the length of BE, and non-circular BE (40.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reports) with respect to the number and height of the strips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, if detected, was described (67.2%) by its length, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> by standard classifications (70.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, biopsy practice differed significantly as a function of the indication, the experience and status of the operator, or the medical management of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that the endoscopic reports of BE are not sufficiently rigorous and that the absence of biopsies is frequently not justified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the future, standardized reports could be proposed by working groups of experts and then prospectively tested and approved </plain></SENT>
