<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: To compare the prevalence of extra-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> in patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) with SEER database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with BE and EAC are part of a NIH supported Familial Barrett's investigation involving personal and family history and pathology correlation recorded in the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data pertaining to extra-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> in the proband was extracted into an excel datasheet for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expected prevalence obtained from SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) NIH database (1973-2006) for the general population, matched for age, was compared with our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 1091 probands in the database of whom 876 had complete personal history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 57.6 (5-84 years) with 807 Caucasians and 710 males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall incidence of extra-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> was higher in our cohort when compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a strong association of certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types in patients with BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, further epidemiologic and genetic research is needed for investigation and development of genetic fingerprints </plain></SENT>
