<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Twenty six patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> mainly located in the distal/ abdominal esophagus were treated by THDE: <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> (Group-S, n=17) and BAC (Group-A, n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The length of the mobilized esophagus (D1) and that of the removed esophagus (D2) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After surgery, we measured the distance between the stapled line of the esophagogastrostomy and the diaphragmatic hiatus (D3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ratio of D3 to the distance between the bronchial bifurcation and the hiatus (D3-ratio) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean D1, D2 and D3 were 91.2mm, 65.2mm and 63.2mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences among D1, D2 and D3 between Group-S and Group-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean D3-ratio was 51.9%, and there was no difference between Group-S and Group-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No postoperative mortality was observed, although postoperative complications were observed in 2 patients (7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After THDE, no local recurrence was observed, node recurrence in 4 (15.4%) and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in 7 (26.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival rate after THDE was 70.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (26.9%) complained of heartburn and only one of Group-S frequently felt heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In endoscopic findings, most of the patients with heartburn were classified as Grade M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 65mm of the distal esophagus and approximately 50% of the distance between the bronchial bifurcation and the hiatus was safely removed by THDE for <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> and BAC of the distal/abdominal esophagus, in spite of limited cases </plain></SENT>
