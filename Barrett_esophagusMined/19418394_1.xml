<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The current gold standard in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> monitoring consists of four-quadrant biopsies every 1-2 cm in accordance with the Seattle protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adding brush cytology processed by digital image cytometry (DICM) may further increase the detection of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who are at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the additional diagnostic value and accuracy of DICM when added to the standard histological analysis in a cross-sectional multicenter study of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in Switzerland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred sixty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent 239 endoscopies with biopsy and brush cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DICM was carried out on 239 cytology specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measures of the test accuracy of DICM (relative risk, sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios) were obtained by dichotomizing the histopathology results (high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> vs. <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> others) and DICM results (<z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>/intermediate pattern vs. diploidy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DICM revealed diploidy in 83% of 239 endoscopies, an intermediate pattern in 8.8%, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in 8.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An intermediate DICM result carried a relative risk (RR) of 12 and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> a RR of 27 for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adding DICM to the standard biopsy protocol, a pathological cytometry result (aneuploid or intermediate) was found in 25 of 239 endoscopies (11%; 18 patients) with low-risk histology (no high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow-up of 14 of these 18 patients, histological deterioration was seen in 3 (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DICM from brush cytology may add important information to a standard biopsy protocol by identifying a subgroup of BE-patients with high-risk cellular abnormalities </plain></SENT>
