<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the inter-observer agreement (IOA) in identifying AFI-positive lesions and to assess the overall accuracy of AFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anonymized AFI and high resolution white light (HRE) images were prospectively collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The AFI images were presented in random order, followed by corresponding AFI + HRE images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three AFI experts and 3 AFI non-experts scored images after a training presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IOA was calculated using kappa and accuracy was calculated with histology as gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-four sets of images were prospectively collected from 63 patients (48 males, mean age 69 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The IOA for number of AF positive lesions was fair when AFI images were presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This improved to moderate with corresponding AFI and HRE images [experts 0.57 (0.44-0.70), non-experts 0.47 (0.35-0.62)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IOA for the site of AF lesion was moderate for experts and fair for non-experts using AF images, which improved to substantial for experts [κ = 0.62 (0.50-0.72)] but remained at fair for non-experts [κ = 0.28 (0.18-0.37)] with AFI + HRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among experts, the accuracy of identifying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 0.76 (0.7-0.81) using AFI images and 0.85 (0.79-0.89) using AFI + HRE images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The accuracy was 0.69 (0.62-0.74) with AFI images alone and 0.75 (0.70-0.80) using AFI + HRE among non-experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The IOA for AF positive lesions is fair to moderate using AFI images which improved with addition of HRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall accuracy of identifying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was modest, and was better when AFI and HRE images were combined </plain></SENT>
