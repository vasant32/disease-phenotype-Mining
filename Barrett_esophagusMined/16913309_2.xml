<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although technically complex, combined laparoscopic and thoracoscopic esophageal resection is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A case series of 20 patients who underwent minimally invasive total esophagectomy is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was a review of a prospective database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose was to evaluate early results with laparoscopic total esophagectomy for benign and malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between January 2003 and November 2005, 20 patients underwent minimally invasive esophageal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations were performed by the same two surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age, gender, indications for surgery, pathologic stage, operative time, blood loss, transfusion requirements, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, postoperative complications, and mortality were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diet progression, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, and need for stricture management were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 20 minimally invasive total esophagectomies performed, 18 (90%) were completed successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average age of the patients was 53 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (n = 13), <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 2), and benign stricture (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The average operating time was 467 minutes (range 346-580 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median blood loss was 350 mL (range 150-500 mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The median intensive care unit stay was 2 days, and the median hospital length of stay was 12 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pathology revealed that 7 per cent of patients had stage I disease, 27 per cent of patients had stage II disease, and 53 per cent of patients had stage III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There was a single mortality (5%), a cervical leak in two patients (10%), a gastric tip <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in one patient (5%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002575'>tracheoesophageal fistula</z:hpo> in one patient (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Major complications occurred in eight patients (40%) and minor complications in nine (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (72%) patients were discharged on enteral tube feeds to supplement caloric intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The application of minimally invasive techniques in the arena of esophageal surgery continues to evolve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This approach has the potential to improve mortality, hospital stay, and other outcomes when compared with open methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Although technically complex, laparoscopic total esophagectomy is feasible </plain></SENT>
