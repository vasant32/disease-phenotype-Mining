<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> has been known to occur after esophagectomy or gastrectomy in which the gastroesophageal junction with its associated lower esophageal sphincter has been resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is thought to be secondary to the refluxogenic nature of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was based on the hypothesis that patients who undergo a fundoplication with the resection would have a lower incidence of the development of postoperative Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent any type of esophagectomy or proximal gastrectomy in which the gastroesophageal junction was resected and an esophagogastrostomy performed were eligible for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data gathered included age, gender, preoperative diagnosis, operation, postoperative pathology, occurrence and timing of postoperative upper endoscopy, and presence of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> on postoperative endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was done with Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 179 patients who underwent resection, 151 had follow-up endoscopy documenting the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 53 patients without fundoplications, 8 (18%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> on follow-up upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 98 patients with fundoplications, 5 (6%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that concomitant fundoplication with resection of the gastroesophageal junction may have some protective effect against the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A randomized trial will be required to prove this assertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Also, it is still unclear as to the consequences of the development of post-resection <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
