<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002575'>tracheoesophageal fistula</z:hpo> (EA-TEF) were treated in Tampere University Hospital in the years 1963 through 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcome was evaluated with a questionnaire, pulmonary and esophageal function test results, 24-hour pH level monitoring, tracheobronchoscopy findings, and esophagogastroscopy with biopsy sections and samples for <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One third of the respondents reported having impaired quality of life because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory infections</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">difficulties in swallowing</z:e> and coughing at night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen percent had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of symptoms decreased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Impaired pulmonary function, GER, <z:mp ids='MP_0004108'>abnormal esophageal peristalsis</z:mp>, and transit time were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tracheobronchoscopy showed tracheal narrowing and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in one third; in histopathologic analysis, however, the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was more than doubled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologically, <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> was found in 51%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 6%, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> in 21% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The severity of GER, esophageal peristaltic abnormality, tracheal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and impairment of pulmonary function seems to be alleviated with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the long-term outcome of EA-TEF patients seems to be favorable, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as functional abnormalities remain frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>Gastric metaplasia</z:mp> in the esophagus and the high rate of tracheal, esophageal, and gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> indicate a need for long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
