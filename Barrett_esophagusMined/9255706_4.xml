<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four gels were tested: noveon AA-1, keltrol T, lutrol and blanose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An initial in-vitro study of gel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> showed that noveon and keltrol had longer <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> transit times than lutrol and blanose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In-vivo assays indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX was synthesized by gastric mucosa when ALA-noveon and ALA-lutrol were used (preferable results for noveon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Keltrol was eliminated from the study after these investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only ALA-noveon gel was retained for studies of the relationship between ALA dose and fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence measurements in-vivo showed that ALA concentration and application time had an influence on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum intensity (2091 counts s-1) was found with 2 mg mL-1 ALA, and fluorescence intensities differed with application time, reaching 1805 counts s-1 after 240 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ALA-noveon, showing good <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and enabling efficient diffusion of ALA at a pH &lt; 6, was considered the best formulation for maintaining ALA stability </plain></SENT>
