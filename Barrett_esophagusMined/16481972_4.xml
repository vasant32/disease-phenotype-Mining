<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, many endoscopic therapies based on thermal or photobiologic ablation of BE have been provided, with positive short-term results in 60-100% of cases, but long-term results are still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate long-term results of BE endoscopic ablation with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi>-Plasma Coagulation (APC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients were treated (every 3 weeks) with APC until the eradication of BE and the squamous epithelium restoration were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the treatment and the first 6 months of follow-up, patients received 40 mg/die <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi>; then the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) dose was 20 mg/die </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic and histologic controls have been performed every 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study considered the f√¨rst 32 patients who completed at least 24 months of follow-up, whose median was 49.5 months (range: 24-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ablation of BE was achieved with a median of 2.0 APC sessions, without side- effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recurrence of SIM (specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) was detected in 3 patients, while nor <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that APC can lead both to eradication of BE and the restoration of squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="?"><plain>As recent reports indicated the persistence of SIM beneath the new epithelium and even a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic growth</z:e> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) in the treated area, despite APC, 2 questions have arisen: is APC unable to radically ablate BE or on the contrary are these findings due to defects of the ablative technique needing improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To settle more precise conclusions, further investigation with larger numbers of patients and for longer follow-up is required </plain></SENT>
