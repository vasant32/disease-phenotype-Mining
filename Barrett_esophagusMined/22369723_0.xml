<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Oesophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> are benign lesions known as risk factors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to diagnose these early changes before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Autofluorescence endoscopy is a fast and non-invasive method of imaging of tissues based on the natural fluorescence of endogenous fluorophores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to prove the diagnostic utility of autofluorescence endoscopy with digital image processing in histological diagnosis of endoscopic findings in the upper digestive tract, primarily in the imaging of oesophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the retrospective analysis of about 200 endoscopic procedures in the upper digestive tract, 67 cases of benign, precancerous or cancerous changes were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>White light endoscopy (WLE) image, single-channel (red or green) autofluorescence images, as well as green and red fluorescence intensities in two modal fluorescence image and red-to-green (R/G) ratio (Numerical Colour Value, NCV) were correlated with histopathologic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The NCV analysis in autofluorescence imaging (AFI) showed increased R/G ratio in cancerous changes in 96% vs. 85% in WLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous analysis with digital image processing allowed us to diagnose suspicious tissue as cancerous in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was confirmed in 90% vs. 79% (AFI vs. WLE), and 98% in imaging with digital image processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In benign lesions, WLE allowed us to exclude tissue as malignant in 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using autofluorescence endoscopy R/G ratio was increased in only 10% of benign changes causing the picture to be interpreted as suspicious, but when both methods were used together, 97.5% were cases excluded as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean R/G ratios were estimated to be 2.5 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, 1.25 in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and 0.75 in benign changes and were statistically significant (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Autofluorescence imaging is a sensitive method to diagnose precancerous and cancerous early stages of the diseases located in oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Especially in two-modal imaging including white light endoscopy, autofluorescence imaging with digital image processing seems to be a useful modality of early diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Also in observation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> changes, it facilitates differentiation between neoplastic and benign lesions and more accurate estimation of the risk of potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
