<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Guidelines suggest that patients with nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) undergo endoscopic surveillance every 3 to 5 years, but actual use of surveillance endoscopy and the determinants of variation in surveillance intervals are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure use of surveillance endoscopy and its variation in patients with nondysplastic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Multicenter, cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Three sites in Arizona, Minnesota, and North Carolina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved patients who had prevalent BE without a history of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Participants were given validated measures of quality of life, numeracy, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk perception, and the total number of prior endoscopic surveillance examinations was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Oversurveillance was defined as &gt;1 surveillance examination per 3-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 235 patients with nondysplastic BE, 76% were male and 94% were white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average (± standard deviation [SD]) duration of BE was 6.5 ± 5.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean (± SD) number of endoscopies per 3-year period was 2.7 ± 2.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Oversurveillance was present in 65% of participants, resulting in a mean of 2.3 excess endoscopies per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither numeracy skills nor patient perception of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk were associated with oversurveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Endoscopies were measured by patient report, which is subject to error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Results may be generalizable only to patients seen in academic centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most patients with nondysplastic BE had more surveillance endoscopic examinations than is recommended by published guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patient factors did not predict oversurveillance, indicating that other factors may influence decisions about the interval and frequency of surveillance examinations </plain></SENT>
