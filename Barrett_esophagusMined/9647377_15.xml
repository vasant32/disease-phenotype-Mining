<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Instillation of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> onto the uterine cervix at colposcopy has been used for many years to highlight dysplastic areas and thereby enhance the ability to obtain targeted biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As part of an ongoing trial of multipolar electrocoagulation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, we sought to develop a simple technique to identify small islands of residual specialized columnar epithelium after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 21 consecutive patients, 5 to 10 mL of 1.5% <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> was sprayed onto the distal esophagus using a spray catheter, followed immediately by spraying 50 mL of tap water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initially, a whitish coloration developed in both esophageal and gastric epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2 to 3 minutes, the esophageal squamous mucosa remained white but the columnar epithelium became reddish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remnant islands of Barrett's epithelium were outlined by a white rim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">Acetic acid</z:chebi> instillation enhances the ability to detect small or indistinguishable remnant islands of columnar epithelium after endoscopic treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This method is safe, rapid, and inexpensive </plain></SENT>
