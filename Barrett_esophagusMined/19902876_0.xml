<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heavy use of tobacco and alcohol are common associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The premalignant potential of ESP has long been debated in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical course is variable, ranging from spontaneous regression to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to the paucity of reported cases, no generalized therapeutic or surveillance recommendations exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) has been successfully used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> as well as superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, its safety and efficacy in treating ESP with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Balloon-based radiofrequency ablation using the HALO90 Ablation System is designed to remove the diseased cells using controlled heat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In recent clinical trials, it has shown great promise in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We report the first ever use of balloon-based radiofrequency ablation to treat ESP with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms resolved after the first therapy session, however, ablation therapy was terminated early because <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> in-situ was detected on surveillance endoscopy prior to the fourth therapy session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although we failed to treat type 4 ESP with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with balloon-based radiofrequency ablation therapy, we believe that it might play a role in treating other localized types of ESP </plain></SENT>
