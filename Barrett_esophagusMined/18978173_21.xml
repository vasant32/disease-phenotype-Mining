<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the demographics and incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> diagnosis using community-based data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Kaiser Permanente, Northern California healthcare membership, 1994-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Members with an electronic diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and prevalence of a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> diagnosis by race, sex, age and calendar year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 4205 persons met the study definition for a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence in 2006 was highest among non-Hispanic whites (39/100,000 race-specific member-years, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 35 to 43), with lower rates among Hispanics (22/100,000, 95% CI 16 to 29), Asians (16/100,000, 95% CI 11 to 22), and blacks (6/100,000, 95% CI 2 to 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence was higher among men than women (31 vs 17/100,000, respectively, year 2006; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence increased with age from 2 per 100,000 for persons aged 21-30 years, to a peak of 31 per 100,000 member-years for persons aged 61-70 years (year 2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no increase in the incidence of new diagnoses until the last two observation years, which coincided with changes in data collection methods and may be due to bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence among active members increased almost linearly to 131/100,000 member-years by 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The demographic distributions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> differ markedly by race, age and sex and were comparable to those for oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, demographic disparities in oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> risk may arise partly from the risk of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, rather than from differing risks of progression from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There has been an almost linear increase in the prevalence of diagnosed disease </plain></SENT>
