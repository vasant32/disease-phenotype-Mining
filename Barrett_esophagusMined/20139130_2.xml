<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of inflammatory processes is a hallmark of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to investigate (i) the transcriptional responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (DCA) in cell lines representative of either end of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> sequence, (ii) the expression of DCA-regulated genes in data charting oesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and (iii) the impact of these genes on oesophageal inflammatory signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene expression microarrays were utilized to demonstrate differential transcriptional responses between squamous (HET-1A) and adenomatous (SKGT4) cell lines exposed to DCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differential basal and DCA-inducible expression of cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 8 was observed between both cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cohort of DCA-regulated genes specific to each cell type was identified in microarray experimentation and subsequently validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell type-specific genes included TRB3, CXCL14, GDF15 and LIF in HET-1A cells, with COX2-, ESM1-, URHF1- and IL1alpha-and IL1beta-specific expression in SKGT4 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over 30% of the genes altered in BO and OAC were shown to be regulated by DCA utilizing an integrative genomic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One such gene, tribbles-homology-3 (TRB3) was induced specifically in HET-1A cells, absent in SKGT4 cells and decreased in BO samples in silico and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition and re-introduction of TRB3 in HET-1A and SKGT4 cells, respectively, demonstrated the ability of TRB3 to regulate inflammatory signalling through nuclear factor-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study identifies mechanisms through which <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> such as DCA, in conjunction with the loss of key signalling molecules, could regulate oesophageal metaplasticity </plain></SENT>
