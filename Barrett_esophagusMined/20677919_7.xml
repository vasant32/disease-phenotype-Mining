<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of bone marrow expressing beta galactosidase into a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mouse, followed by surgical esophagojejunostomy, allowed tracking of BMDCs into the surgical anastomosis and resulting Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human tissue from a male patient who had been transplanted with female bone marrow and later developed esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> allowed us to tract donor-derived cells into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of antibodies directed against beta-galactosidase (animal studies) and X/Y fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (human studies), combined with specific lineage staining directed against epithelial, fibroblast, endothelial, and leukocyte markers, we show that bone marrow cells contribute to both the epithelial and stromal component of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that BMDCs can generate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated fibroblasts as well as contribute directly to epithelial cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0152018" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the esophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
