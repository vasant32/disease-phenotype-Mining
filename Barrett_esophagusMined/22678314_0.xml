<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2007 to June 2008, 43 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> underwent laparoscopic Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication; 7 were lost during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent endoscopy, 24-hour pH-metry, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</z:hpo>-Health-Related Quality-of-Life (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-HRQL), and Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaires preoperatively, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopic findings revealed complete healing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> was still present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients reported persistence of symptoms but postoperative pH-metry and endoscopy showed the absence of reflux; 2 patients (5.5%) were still on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (19.4%) reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> for solids for at least 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Readmission for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was required for 2 (5.5%) and 1 patient underwent endoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 6 and 12 months, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, no gas-bloat syndrome was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Johnsson &amp; DeMeester score and QoL measurement obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-HRQL and SF-36 revealed a significant improvement in the related domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, 23 patients (63.8%) were completely satisfied and after 12 months, 30 patients (83.3%) were satisfied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication is safe and effective for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, improving QoL </plain></SENT>
