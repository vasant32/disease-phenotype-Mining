<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to review the experience of patients with distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> that was diagnosed after bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted to identify patients who had undergone bariatric surgery (1999 to 2006) and who later developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients (of 2,875 [0.1%]) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>: 2 after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 1 after vertical banded gastroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients had complaints of reflux, and two were treated with esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The third patient presented with invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and died 2 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the importance of precise endoscopic evaluation before bariatric surgery in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), of the necessity for continuing postsurgical surveillance in patients with known Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and of early evaluation in patients who develop new symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> after bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
