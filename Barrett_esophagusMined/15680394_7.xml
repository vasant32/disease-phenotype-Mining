<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Decreased cell-surface expression of Fas (CD95) results in resistance to Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because p53 is known to increase transcription of Fas and also may induce trafficking of the protein to the plasma membrane, we investigated whether the loss of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt)-p53 function accounts for our previous findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> containing areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were immunostained for p53 and Fas protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three EA cell lines were transfected with a wt-p53 containing adenovirus to examine the effects of p53 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The p53 status of these EA cell lines was determined by sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Regions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> where p53 protein accumulation was observed corresponded to areas of loss of Fas expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the p53 coding sequence in three EA cell lines (Seg-1, Bic-1, and Flo-1) that retain Fas protein within the cytoplasm, demonstrated that Seg-1 contained wt-p53, but mutations were found in Flo-1 and Bic-1 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adenoviral transduction of the cell lines with wt-p53 resulted in cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> in Seg-1 and Bic-1 and induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in Flo-1, but did not result in an increase in Fas protein expression, cell-surface expression, or restoration of sensitivity to Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that decreased cell-surface expression of Fas and resistance to Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may occur independently of loss of wt p53 expression </plain></SENT>
