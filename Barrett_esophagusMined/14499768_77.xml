<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> for which regular endoscopic follow-up is usually advised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC) in patients with BE and the impact of endoscopic surveillance on mortality from AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of newly diagnosed BE patients was studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic and histological surveillance was recommended every 2 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up status was determined from hospital and registry office records and telephone calls to the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1987 to 1997, BE was diagnosed in 177 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We excluded three with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) at the time of enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was complete in 166 patients (135 male, 31 female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean length of endoscopic follow-up was 5.5 yr (range 0.5-13.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) was present initially in 16 patients (9.6%) and found during follow-up in another 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in 75% of cases, LGD was not confirmed on later biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HGD was found during surveillance in three patients (1.8%), one with simultaneous AC; two with HGD developed AC later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AC was detected in five male patients during surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of AC was 1/220 (5/1100) patient-years of total follow-up, or 1/183.6 (5/918) patient-years in subjects undergoing endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Four AC patients died, and one was alive with advanced-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mean number of endoscopies performed for surveillance, rather than for symptoms, was 2.4 (range 1-10) per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up years the cohort had a total of 528 examinations and more than 4000 biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AC in BE is low, confirming recent data from the literature reporting an overestimation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In our patient cohort, surveillance involved a large expenditure of effort but did not prevent any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The benefit of surveillance remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
