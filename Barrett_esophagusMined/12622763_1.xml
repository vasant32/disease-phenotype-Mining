<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of gastric acid is difficult to separate from that of bile in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">oesophageal reflux</z:e>, and the complications of this can take many years to develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gastric surgery patients provide a good model for both significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> and marked gastric acid inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the oesophageal abnormalities in gastric surgery patients undergoing long-term follow-up, compared with patients with intact stomachs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and forty adult patients were endoscoped regardless of their age, sex or type of surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oesophageal damage was graded on a scale of 0-5, and biopsies were taken to exclude <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, to diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and to identify Helicobacter pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 240 patients studied, 140 had undergone gastric surgery 27 years (19-31 years) [median (interquartile range)] prior to endoscopy, and these patients had milder oesophageal scores and fewer cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 119 patients with post-surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, 31 (26%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, two (1.7%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagitis</z:e> and oesophageal scores of 0 (0-1) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results compared with corresponding values of 37 (37%; P = 0.11), 11 (11%; P = 0.007) and 0 (0-2) (P = 0.046), respectively, in 100 patients with intact stomachs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, of the 83 patients with vagotomy, 19 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> (23%; P = 0.05), none had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagitis</z:e> and lower oesophageal scores (P = 0.02) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and severity of reflux and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagitis</z:e> are not increased in patients with a long history of gastric surgery, particularly after vagotomy, and despite being at risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
