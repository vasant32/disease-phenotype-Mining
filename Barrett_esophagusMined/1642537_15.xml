<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the approach used for resection influences outcome, we studied 88 patients who underwent resection; 14 had stage I or II disease, 74 had stage III, and 40 had stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One third of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were noted on screening endoscopy to have potentially curable disease; the others were diagnosed with stage III or IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transhiatal esophagectomy was performed in 63 patients; 24 patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found no difference in survival or morbidity between transhiatal and transthoracic esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall 5-year survival for stage I and II disease was 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For stage III and IV disease, 5-year survival was 14.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aggressive surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> facilitates the discovery of early disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> can result in cure of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and improved palliation of more advanced disease </plain></SENT>
