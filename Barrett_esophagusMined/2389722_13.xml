<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine whether patients with endoscopically proven active <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease have a salivary deficiency of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), compared to patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Saliva was collected from fasting subjects prior to EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of EGF were measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical evaluation was performed by analysis of variant followed by Student's t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were lower in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease (3.1 +/- 0.54 ng/ml, mean +/- SE, n = 25) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (4.9 +/- 0.56 ng/ml, n = 58, p less than 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in salivary hEGF were noted between patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EGD and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (3.85 +/- .86 ng/ml, n = 13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (4.5 +/- 1.3 ng/ml, n = 7), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (5.3 +/- 1.5 ng/ml, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the salivary levels of hEGF between males and females, or between smokers and nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation of hEGF levels with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiologic significance of this finding is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lower salivary hEGF may reduce one of the defensive mechanisms responsible for protecting the gastroduodenal mucosa from injury by physicochemical agents, thus contributing to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
