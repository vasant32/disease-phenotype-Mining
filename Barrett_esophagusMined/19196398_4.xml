<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: It has been reported that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) may have gastric acid hypersecretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serological markers such as serum pepsinogen or gastrin have been used to estimate the gastric secretory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the serum pepsinogen and gastrin concentrations in view of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> status between BE patients and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six patients with long-segment BE were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three age- and sex-matched controls were assigned to each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum pepsinogen and gastrin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay and H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was determined by histology and serum IgG antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> was present in 4 of 36 patients (11%) with BE and in 80 of 108 controls (74%), being less prevalent in BE patients than in the controls (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When examined in the H. pylori-negative subjects, both the serum pepsinogen I and pepsinogen II concentrations in BE patients were significantly higher than those in the controls (mean pepsinogen I:BE 51.0 +/- 14.0 ng/mL vs control 38.9 +/- 13.5 ng/mL, P = 0.0012; mean pepsinogen II:BE 10.8 +/- 4.0 ng/mL vs control 7.9 +/- 2.0 ng/mL, P = 0.0097) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the serum gastrin levels between BE patients and the controls irrespective of the H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most of the Japanese BE patients are characterized by the absence of H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and high levels of serum pepsinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Determination of the serum pepsinogen level in combination with the H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> status could be a useful serological marker for BE screening </plain></SENT>
