<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique was prospectively studied in 27 patients with histologically proved <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and 17 patients with biopsy-confirmed reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The esophageal transit time and percentage of emptying were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The only quantitative parameter of radionuclide esophageal scintigraphy to show a significant difference between the two conditions was the percentage of emptying, which was abnormal in 48% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> versus 31% of patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the latter group, the mean percentage of emptying approached <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (89.5%), while in the former group it was decreased to 82.1% (P less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither emptying parameter correlated with length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data support the hypothesis of inherent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal dysmotility</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Half of the patients with this condition have impaired esophageal clearance and may benefit from drug therapy </plain></SENT>
