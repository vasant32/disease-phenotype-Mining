<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its expression has not been well characterized in human gastrointestinal tissues, but has been reported in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the increasing appreciation for the role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cells or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-initiating cells in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, we sought to explore the expression of Lgr5 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and premalignant human gastrointestinal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using standard immunostaining, we compared expression of Lgr5 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon and small intestine vs. small intestinal and colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue, Lgr5 was expressed in the expected stem cell niche, at the base of crypts, as seen in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e>, Lgr5+ cells were not restricted to the crypt base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, their overall numbers were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, Lgr5+ cells were commonly found clustered at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface and rarely at the crypt base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we compared immunostaining of Lgr5 with that of CD133, a previously characterized marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-initiating cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and found that they identified distinct subpopulations of cells that were in close proximity, but did not costain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that (1) Lgr5 is a potential marker of intestinal stem cells in humans and (2) loss of restriction to the stem cell niche is an early event in the premalignant transformation of stem cells and may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
