<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Imaging and other advanced technologies for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> are undergoing a major revolution on several fronts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is facilitated by convergence of key technologies including advanced endoscopic-detection systems, more specific contrast agents, rapid and high-resolution cross-sectional imaging, and miniaturization of construction systems for making <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> imaging equipment smaller and less invasive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This convergence is occurring along traditional translational research pathways (clinical medicine-molecular biology) as well as nontraditional lines (clinical medicine-optical physics/engineering and molecular biology-optical physics/engineering) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These new efforts are producing a wide array of technologies aimed at improving detection, classification, and monitoring of gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, especially for colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> because of easier accessibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A critical goal is to detect lesions at their premalignant stages, thereby permitting meaningful intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inspired by these advances, the American Gastroenterological Association and the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute sponsored a symposium held in Bethesda, MD, from October 4-5, 2004, bringing together leading investigators with diverse backgrounds in imaging technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aims of this symposium were to summarize the state of the art and priorities for research in the coming decade in the field of imaging and advanced technology for gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this overview, we summarize the salient results of that symposium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The initial sections discuss the major technologies in each area of endoluminal imaging and molecular imaging followed by applications to specific diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and colon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Each section focuses on the current state of the art then lists major priorities for research in the field </plain></SENT>
