<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to compare the demographic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in men and women and to determine the prevalence and incidence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients enrolled in the Cleveland Clinic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> Registry from 1979-2002 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age, ethnicity, number of endoscopies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> size, length of Barrett's segment, and prevalence and incidence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were compared between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 839 patients in the registry (628 men and 211 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Barrett's segment length was greater in men than in women (mean, 5.06 +/- 4.2 vs 4.05 +/- 3.27 cm, respectively; P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences for other parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 114 prevalence cases of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (96 men, 18 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women were less likely to have prevalent high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> than men (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.88; P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 13 incidence cases of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (11 men, 2 women) during a mean follow-up of 4.72 years, which was similar in both genders with an incidence rate of 1 in 179 patient-years of follow-up for women and 1 in 91 patient-years of follow-up in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five percent of patients in our registry are women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is greater in men than in women, but other features are similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in women is approximately half that of men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> are similar in men and women, although the number of cases is small </plain></SENT>
