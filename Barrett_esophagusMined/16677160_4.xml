<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to elucidate its underlying pathologies and their chronology by investigation of esophageal specimens in patients undergoing surgery (esophageal resection or myotomy) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo>, histopathologic examinations of the esophageal wall focussing on the myenteric plexus were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative diagnosis was based on clinical evaluation, esophagogastroscopy, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> esophagogram in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, and esophageal manometry in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age at the time of surgery was 54 years (range: 14-78 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In eight cases, the complete esophageal, body and in nine cases a smooth muscle biopsy including parts of the myenteric plexus from the distal part of the esophagus (high pressure zone) was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The tissue specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The staining procedures were <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (HE), Elastica van Gieson (EvG), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>) reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical examinations were performed with antibodies against B and T lymphocytes, neurofilament, protein gene-related product (PGP 9.5), S-100 protein, myosin, desmin, smooth muscle actin and substance P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 13 of 17 patients, a significant reduction of the number of intramural ganglion cells was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Common findings were a severe <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of the smooth muscle layer (10/17) and obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> of the smooth muscle cells (5/17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Staining for B and T lymphocytes found signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in mucosal and muscular areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients exhibited a marked invasion of eosinophilic granulocytes of the muscularis propria (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>Esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> had developed in three patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> in two and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ in another patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Severe inflammatory reactions (neural, eosinophilic and mucosal) dominated in patients with a longstanding history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> (&gt;10 years) as well as a marked endomysial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The histopathological investigations of the esophageal wall in 17 patients undergoing esophageal resection or myotomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> suggest that the reduction of intramural ganglion cells might be a secondary change, probably due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> triggered by autoimmune mechanisms or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> degenerative process of the central and/or peripheral part of the vagal nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e> could also be a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> of the smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
