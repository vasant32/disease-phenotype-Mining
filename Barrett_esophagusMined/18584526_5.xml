<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of a new ingestion protocol for capsule endoscopy (CE) in evaluating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (GORD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy (OGD) was performed 1 week prior to CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first 28 subjects swallowed the capsule following the original ingestion protocol (OIP) and the subsequent 30 subjects following a simplified ingestion protocol (SIP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CE videos were reviewed by two independent investigators who were blinded to the OGD findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 48 patients included, 24 were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e> (67% male, mean age 49.5+/-13 years) and 24 with Barrett oesophagus (BO) (88% male, 55.6+/-10 years) by OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 10 asymptomatic healthy controls (50% male, 45.8+/-7.1 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oesophageal transit time was faster in patients using the SIP compared to the OIP (126+/-26 s versus 214+/-33; p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete evaluation of the Z-line was possible in 19/28 (68%) of the OIPs compared to 28/30 (93%) of the SIPs (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity for detecting any oesophageal abnormality was higher in the SIP group than in the OIP group (97% versus 89%; p=0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, CE detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> in 22/24 patients (sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 88%) and BO in 23/24 patients (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 41/44 (93%) preferred CE over OGD and experienced less discomfort and pain during CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CE is an accurate method for detecting mucosal oesophageal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The new ingestion protocol improves the visualization of the Z-line, which is likely to increase the diagnostic yield of CE </plain></SENT>
