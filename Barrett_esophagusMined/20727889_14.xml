<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied gastric biopsy samples from 78,985 unique patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologic findings were correlated with sociodemographic patient characteristics using multivariate logistic regression to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> had similar epidemiologic patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of each, based on histology analyses, was significantly associated with that of the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were also characterized by similar geographic distributions within the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 disorders were more common among men and among Medicaid patients (compared with those with other insurance) and were inversely associated with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (less frequent in patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e> and associated disorders, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, are inversely associated with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
