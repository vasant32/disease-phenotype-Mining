<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In Barrett's patients, functional disorders of oesophageal motility are currently measured by oesophageal manometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet abnormalities of oesophageal volume transport in the critical regions of the upper oesophageal sphincter (UOS) and lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) cannot be determined using these methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To further characterise the activity of the sphincter regions, we developed a quantitative method for differentiation of oesophageal volume transport in Barrett's patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a new technique of processing scintigraphic images, with data analysis based on a new concept of relative local transit time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and 11 healthy volunteers were examined using alimentary scintigraphy after a semisolid test meal in a multiple swallow test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In individual scintigraphic images of five swallows we studied: (1) overall oesophageal clearance and (2) the topographic profile of the relative local transit time obtained by image conversion to a two dimensional line graph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This profile was reconstructed by assembling constituent Gauss bands, allocating their integrals to five oesophageal regions according to their band position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Overall oesophageal clearance was not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(2) In comparison with healthy volunteers, relative regional transit times of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 Barrett's patients were significantly increased in the hypopharyngeal region and decreased in the region of the distal oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extent of the decrease in the region of the distal oesophagus showed a close correlation with the length of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Improvement in image processing allows alimentary scintigraphy to describe different regional patterns of oesophageal volume transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Local oesophageal bolus transit is markedly abnormal in Barrett's patients without alteration in clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> itself implies a negative impact on both sphincter functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings substantiate the diagnostic value of refined oesophageal scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
