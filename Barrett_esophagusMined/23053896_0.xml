<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Liver-intestine (LI)-cadherin, an intestine-specific marker, is involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> development in gastric and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> and could be of value in diagnosis and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the expression of LI-cadherin in the sequence of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and to evaluate its association with clinicopathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LI-cadherin expression was immunohistologically investigated, by use of anti-CDH17 antibody, in gastric mucosa (GM) biopsies taken from the cardia (n = 9), in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) without intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (without IEN) (n = 9) and BE with low-grade IEN (n = 11), and in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The immunoreactivity score was highest in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (mean IRS = 4.0), and dropped gradually from BE with IEN and BE without IEN (mean IRS = 2.0) to cardia mucosa (IRS = 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the intensity of staining and the percentage of positive cells increased during the sequential stages of BE <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis showed that LI-cadherin expression was significantly different between cardiac epithelium and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, percentage of positive cells in GM was significantly different from that in BE with IEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LI-cadherin IRS was lower for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with poor differentiation than for moderately differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, but the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LI-cadherin is a sensitive marker of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and can be helpful for early histologic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; it is, however, not significantly different between BE with and without IEN, and cannot be used to distinguish between these </plain></SENT>
