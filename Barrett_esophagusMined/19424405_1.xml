<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Determine the prevalence, clinical-epidemiological characteristics and predictive factors for Barrets Esophagus (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: An analytical and transversal study was conducted, followed by a case-control study nested in a population participating in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> screening campaign, from January to June 2008 at the Central Hospital of the Peruvian Air Force (FAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A BE case was defined due to the endoscopic presence of columnar-appearing mucosa confirmed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical and endoscopic variables were evaluated, and bivariate and multivariate studies were conducted to identify predictive risk factors, using patients with gastroesophagic reflux and control patients of the study population as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 2273 patients studied, 11 (0.48%) patients with an average age of 52.2 +/- 7.7 years (43-69 year range) suffered from BE, out of which 81.8% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 81.8% were symptomatic, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> in 54.5% and with reflux in 27.3%, while 18.2% were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The short-segment BE was more common than the long-segment BE (72.7% versus 27.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predictive factors found after the bivariate and multivariate analysis (comparing cases versus population control group) were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> [OR = 12.1, CI 95% 2.25 64.75], consumption of AINES [OR = 6.72, CI 95% 1.6-29.1] and consumption of alcohol [OR = 4.22, CI 95% 1.1-16.91] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BE prevalence in the study was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, consumption of AINES, and consumption of alcohol were predictive risk factors to develop BE in the study </plain></SENT>
