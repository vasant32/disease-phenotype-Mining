<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Historically, the majority of patients had been diagnosed with more advanced stages of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, with screening programs, like those in place for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, many patients are being diagnosed earlier in their disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of randomized trials and meta-analyses have led to emerging guidelines advocating for neoadjuvant therapy as part of the treatment algorithm for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, particularly for T3 or greater T-stage and/or node-positive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And for those patients that present with disease localized to the esophageal mucosa, endoscopic mucosal resection has proved to be an effective and less morbid alternative to radical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there is a group of patients that lie between these two extremes for which evidence is sparse and treatment recommendations vary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this manuscript, recent data regarding work-up and treatment are reviewed along with a closer look at those patients clinically staged with T2N0M0 (Stage IIA) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pertinent data in this subset of patients is analyzed as potential treatment algorithms are discussed </plain></SENT>
