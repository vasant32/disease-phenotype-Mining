<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although still controversial, periodic direct clinical examination as well as endoscopic techniques are currently performed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and melanocytic <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in order to detect and treat dysplastic or early malignant changes and therefore improve the patients' prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not known if patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206139" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral lichen planus</z:e> (OLP), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory condition associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development, might benefit from such surveillance as well, nor how this should be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we present the clinical criteria we have adopted over a 12-year period to detect early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of OLP, and report on their impact on the management and prognosis of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall data from 45 patients affected by 117 neoplastic events arising from OLP have been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> surveillance has led us to diagnose most episodes (94.9%; n.: 111) of OLP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in early intraepithelial and microinvasive phases, namely stage 0 and I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153381" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oral cancers</z:e> (T(is) N0M0 or T1N0M0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate, where applicable, has been 96.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Advanced stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153381" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oral cancers</z:e> have been diagnosed in six patients, three of whom have died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the application of strict and rigorous clinical criteria in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> surveillance could help clinicians to detect and treat early OLP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> and therefore improve long-term survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a small subgroup of patients has been shown not to benefit from such surveillance and to be characterized by a rapid development of advanced-stage oral <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, with consequent poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
