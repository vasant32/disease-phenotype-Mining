<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> complications may reflect imbalances between protective and injurious factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through its effects on cell growth, leptin may influence oesophageal mucosal homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine whether leptin receptors are present in the oesophagus, and whether serum or gastric leptin levels are associated with oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From patients referred for upper endoscopy, biopsies were obtained from the stomach and distal oesophagus, and serum samples were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, inflamed or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed on representative sections, and leptin levels in plasma and gastric biopsy samples were determined by specific immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 269 individuals enrolled, 105 were Helicobacter pylori-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 88 patients with complete oesophageal biopsies, 44 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 24 were inflamed and 20 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Receptors for leptin were highly expressed on oesophageal epithelial cells, with similar density and staining pattern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three conditions, and plasma and antral leptin levels did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with Barrett's had significantly (p = 0.01) higher fundic leptin levels (median 202 (interquartile range 123-333) pg/mg) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (126 (78-221) pg/mg) or inflamed (114 (76-195) pg/mg) oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, for every twofold increase in fundic leptin, the odds of having Barrett's was 3.4 times (95% CI 1.5 to 7.6) higher compared with having a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Leptin receptor expression on oesophageal epithelial cells provides a pathway for leptin-mediated signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Variation in gastric leptin production could contribute to differential oesophageal healing and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> progression </plain></SENT>
