<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: A major limitation of photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed an animal model of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> to elucidate the mechanism of stricture development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our studies began in a mouse but, due to its limitations, we advanced to a porcine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the mouse model, 62 mice were injected with Photofrin (2-10 mg/kg) 48 h prior to photoactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Light energy (20-400 Joules/cm (J)) was delivered with a laser probe as a single dose, or fractionated doses (20-150 J) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed when showing signs of distress or 6 to 18 weeks post-illumination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Esophagus was removed, with gross and microscopic examination performed on frozen specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To develop a pig model, six pigs were injected with Photofrin (2 mg/kg) 48 h prior to photoactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Light energy (400 J) was delivered via an endoscope using a laser probe as a single dose or repeated at 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed if they could not eat soft food or lost more than 10% of their original weight according to the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure of mice to doses of 400 J x 1, 125 J x 3, or 150 J x 3 fractions resulted in severe lung damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 90% of the mice without any evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lower energy levels caused minor lung damage and no change in the endothelial layer or a stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In pigs, exposure of 400 J as one or two fractions resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of 10% within 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy, upper GI, contrast swallow, and pathological and histological examination showed evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> at the exposed area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the mouse model, pulmonary toxicity is the limiting factor following esophageal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the pig model we induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> following <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This is the first animal model created to study <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> resulting from <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
