<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human esophagus is lined by stratified squamous epithelium (ESSE), and in some subjects with reflux disease the distal esophagus becomes lined by Barrett's specialized columnar epithelium (BSCE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ESSE and BSCE differ both histologically and functionally, the latter evident by differences in their in vivo transmural electrical potential difference (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), ESSE averaging -15 mV and BSCE being greater than -25 mV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we examine the basis for this difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is done by mounting endoscopic biopsies of ESSE from 25 subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> and BSCE from 19 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in mini-Ussing chambers for electrical recordings basally and after bathing solution ion replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results show that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> of human ESSE reflects a low level of active ion transport (5.1 +/- 0.8 muA/cm(2)) combined with a high level of tissue (electrical) resistance (344 +/- 34 Omega.cm(2)) and that of BSCE reflects a high level of active transport (43.6 +/- 11.6 muA/cm(2)) combined with a low level of resistance (69 +/- 8 Omega.cm(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, active transport in ESSE was principally due to <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> absorption whereas in BSCE it was equally divided between <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> absorption and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>/bicarbonate) secretion, the latter through an apical membrane, 4-acetamido4'-isothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid-sensitive <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As an <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>-secreting tissue with bicarbonate secretory capacity more than fivefold greater than ESSE, BSCE is better suited than ESSE for defense of the esophagus against reflux disease </plain></SENT>
