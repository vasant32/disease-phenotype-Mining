<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between reflux and aberrant <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (DNA) methylation, comparing methylation in the columnar epithelium following successful fundoplication to that in subjects with a failed fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> is the main risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these diseases, there is a high level of DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 41 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and a fundoplication at least 5 years earlier for a 24-hour pH study, endoscopy, and collection of biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were obtained from 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> subjects who had not undergone esophageal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the time of the study, 31 subjects were pH <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 10 abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Columnar biopsies were collected from 21 of the pH <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 9 pH abnormal subjects, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> no surgery subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete regression of columnar mucosa was seen in 7 subjects with pH <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 1 with pH abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> did not differ between groups preoperatively, but was significantly less at the time of the study in the pH <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> compared with pH abnormal or no surgery groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly, fewer genes were methylated in the pH <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> than the pH abnormal or no surgery groups, which did not differ from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of methylated genes correlated with increased reflux, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> length, but not acid-suppression medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fundoplication that reduces reflux to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels can lead to regression of the columnar mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reflux is associated with aberrant DNA methylation, and control of reflux reduces deleterious genomic changes associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
