<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EE) in patients presenting for upper endoscopy may prevent the detection of underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To prospectively determine the proportion of patients detected with BE upon repeat endoscopy after healing of EE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with endoscopically confirmed EE without BE were treated with standard doses of acid suppression therapy and a repeat endoscopy was performed to assess the presence of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If columnar mucosa was visualized in the distal esophagus, targeted biopsies were obtained and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsies were evaluated for the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BE was defined as columnar mucosa in the distal esophagus with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 172 patients with reflux symptoms were diagnosed with EE without BE on initial endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were treated with standard doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy, and after a mean duration of 11 wk (range 8-16 wk), a repeat endoscopy was performed to confirm healing of EE and to document the presence of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On repeat endoscopy, EE was completely healed in 116 patients (67%), and of those, BE was suspected in 32 patients (i.e., columnar-lined distal esophagus) and was confirmed in 16 patients (13.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 56 patients with persistent EE on repeat endoscopy, columnar mucosa in areas of previously healed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was visualized in 8 and confirmed in 5 patients (8.9% of nonhealed cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, 21 (12%) patients were confirmed with BE on repeat endoscopy; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men, mean age 61 yr with a median BE length of 0.5 cm (range 0.5-5 cm, interquartile range 0.5 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of these patients (N = 19) had short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) (i.e., length &lt;3 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with EE undergoing treatment with acid suppressive therapy, BE (mainly SSBE) is detected in approximately 12% of patients on repeat endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with reflux symptoms undergoing endoscopy for the detection of BE (i.e., screening) should be treated with acid suppressive therapy prior to endoscopy to enhance the yield of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, if the goal is to document BE and if EE is found at the initial endoscopy, then repeat endoscopy may be considered after acid suppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
