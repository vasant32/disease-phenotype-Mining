<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its photobleaching characteristics were determined by continually infusing Chromeo P503-labeled alpha-lactalbumin into a sheath-flow cuvette and monitored fluorescence as a function of laser power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The labeled protein is relatively photo-labile with an optimum excitation power of about 2 mW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The unreacted reagent is weakly fluorescent but present at much higher concentration than the labeled protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The unreacted reagent undergoes photobleaching at a laser power more than an order of magnitude higher than the labeled protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-dimensional capillary electrophoresis analysis of Chromeo P503-labeled alpha-lactalbumin produced concentration detection limits (3sigma) of 12 pM and mass detection limits of 0.7 zmol, but with modest theoretical plate counts of 17,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reagent was employed for the two-dimensional capillary electrophoresis analysis of a homogenate prepared from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cell line; the separation quality is similar to that produced by 3-(2-furoyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17362">quinoline</z:chebi>-2-carboxaldehyde (FQ), a more commonly used reagent </plain></SENT>
