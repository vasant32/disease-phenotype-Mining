<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aim to investigate OCM for ex vivo imaging of upper and lower gastrointestinal tract tissues, to establish correlations between OCM imaging and histology, and to provide a baseline for future endoscopic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Co-registered OCM and OCT imaging were performed on fresh surgical specimens and endoscopic biopsy specimens, and images were correlated with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed at 1.06-microm wavelength with &lt;2-microm transverse and &lt;4-microm axial resolution for OCM, and at 14-microm transverse and &lt;3-microm axial resolution for OCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple sites on 75 tissue samples from 39 patients were imaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OCM enabled cellular imaging of specimens from the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts over a smaller field of view compared to OCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Squamous cells and their nuclei, goblet cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, gastric pits and colonic crypts, and fine structures in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OCT provided complementary information through assessment of tissue architectural features over a larger field of view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OCM may provide a complementary imaging modality to standard OCT approaches for endoscopic microscopy </plain></SENT>
