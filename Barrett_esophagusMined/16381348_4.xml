<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Esophagectomy is an operation with high morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its adoption as a minimally invasive operation worldwide has been slow, but the potential benefits of reducing the trauma of surgery need to be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our 30-month experience with transhiatal esophagectomy in a district general hospital is presented herein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were considered for surgery after radiological staging had excluded inoperable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic staging was initially performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors of the esophagus</z:e> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were referred for consideration for resectional surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine underwent outpatient laparoscopy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (age range, 34 to 78, 15 males:5 females) underwent resectional surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventeen transhiatal resections were completed, 2 were converted to open procedures, and 1 transhiatal resection of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086692" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign tumor</z:e> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median time of surgery was 415 minutes (range, 320 to 480) and blood loss was 300 mL (range, 200 to 350) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median length of post-operative ventilation and critical care stay were 1 (range, 1 to 4) and 4 (range, 2 to 8) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median duration of hospitalization was 17 days (range, 10 to 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality was 0; 1 patient who was converted to an open procedure died after a cerebrovascular event on day 34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A zero mortality rate for laparoscopic resection and a low-morbidity rate compare well with morbidity and mortality in reported series using this method and open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy is an advanced, complex procedure that can be performed safely in a district general hospital setting </plain></SENT>
