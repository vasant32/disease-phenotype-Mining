<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 4,002 patients underwent endoscopy from March 2010 to December 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BE was diagnosed if there was histologically proven specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and CIM was diagnosed if <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was accompanied with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005231'>chronic gastritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred twenty four patients underwent endoscopic biopsy, and the prevalence of BE was 1.0% (42/4,002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age and the proportion of males in BE were significantly higher than those of the rest of study population, and BE had slight tendency related to RE than the rest of study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CIM was observed in 34 patients and BE and CIM showed similar results, regarding age, sex and association with RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean length of endoscopic Barrett's mucosa of BE group was 9.2Â±5.1 mm, and it was similar to that of CIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of BE in the secondary care hospital was not low, and old age and male sex were significantly associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because BE was observed in about 10% of biopsied patients and CIM was observed in a similar percentage with BE, the precise targeted biopsy is warranted and the biopsy method should be reestablished through the large prospective study of multiple secondary care hospitals </plain></SENT>
