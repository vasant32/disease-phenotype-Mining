<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An ALA thermosetting gel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">Pluronic</z:chebi> F-127) was developed and evaluated in an in vivo mouse model for potential use in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies of the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">Pluronic</z:chebi> F-127 percentage on thermosetting gel temperature, followed by the influence of ALA concentration on thermosetting temperature and ALA-gel stability as a function of time or temperature were studied </plain></SENT>
