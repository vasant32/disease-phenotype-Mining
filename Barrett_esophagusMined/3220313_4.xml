<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Benign oesophageal stricture</z:e> was present in 23 (41%) of 56 patients consecutive with CLO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 18 the stricture lay at the squamocolumnar mucosal junction and was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e>, in five it was situated in the columnar lined segment and in four of these it was known to have been preceded by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> at the site of the stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls were an age and sex matched group of patients with benign stricture related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e> unassociated with columnar epithelialisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLO associated strictures involving squamous mucosa were situated significantly (p less than 0.01) higher in the oesophagus than non-CLO strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response to endoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and active medical treatment was significantly better, as judged by the need for subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (p less than 0.01) in the CLO than in the non-CLO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that associated columnar epithelialisation of the oesophagus is not in itself an indication for antireflux surgery in the management of benign stricture and these usually respond well to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and medical treatment </plain></SENT>
