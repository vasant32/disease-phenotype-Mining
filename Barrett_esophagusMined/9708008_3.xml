<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As compared to the general population, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) present a 30 to 40 times higher risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their prognosis is poor and it will only be changed trying to recognize and detect preneoplastic changes early in order to provide these patients with an effective surgical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath> is still the "gold standard" as a marker of increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, in view of the inter and intraobserver differences for interpreting it, both as regards its existence and grade, we have investigated other markers which can show this increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim has been to analyze which parameters, in addition to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, can distinguish groups with a higher or lower risk of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> for a differentiated follow-up, so that the cost-benefit ratio is adequate and a sufficiently early diagnosis can be achieved which allows for a healing surgical therapy in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients have been studied, 9 with BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (control group), 9 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 9 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> over BE, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which the presence of p53, c-erb-2, PCNA and CEA was established by histochemistry and the existence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> by static cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PCNA was positive in the three groups, though it was not at the surface epithelium in 55.5% of the control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>C-erb-2 was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> control cases and positive in 5 cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 2 with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protein p53 was positive in one control case, in 2 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 4 with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CEA was positive in 7 control cases and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was found by static cytometry in 5 of 9 control cases, in 4 of 9 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From the analysis of the results obtained, it can be concluded that a positive marker, even in the absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, suggests the presence of a "genomic instability" which may lead to progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study allows us to establish three risk groups (high, low and intermediate) for a differentiated follow-up which allows an early diagnosis, with an adequate cost-benefit ratio </plain></SENT>
