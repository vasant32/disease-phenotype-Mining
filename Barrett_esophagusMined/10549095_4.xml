<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of currently performed surveillance in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is substantially compromised by shortcomings of dysplastic lesions as diagnostic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role of p53 protein expression as complementary method in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>41 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time of surveillance was 46 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>234 archival paraffin blocks containing a total of 627 biopsies were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p53 protein immunostaining by application of the monoclonal antibody DO-1 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of immunohistochemistry were compared with the exact histopathological diagnosis and grading of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In merely four of 206 nondysplastic mucosal sites p53 expression was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, p53 expression was detected with increasing frequency in sites indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (2/9), specimens with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (9/15), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (3/3) and the one with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study shows a close association of nuclear p53 protein expression to the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> in Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, it apparently does not precede the appearance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, nuclear p53 expression as detected by immunohistochemistry may serve to confirm a suspected diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE </plain></SENT>
