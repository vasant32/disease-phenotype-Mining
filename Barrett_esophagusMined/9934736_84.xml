<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We described incidence rates of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in Denmark in a 20-yr period and determined the proportion of patients diagnosed with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> who had a previous diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, making them potential candidates for endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rates of esophageal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> were collected from the Danish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> registry for the period 1970-1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The registry was used to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the period 1987-1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records were retrieved and details concerning previous diagnosis of reflux disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age- and gender-adjusted incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> increased eightfold, from 0.3/10(5)/yr in 1970 to 2.3/10(5)/yr in 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This increase could not be explained by changes in classification or diagnostic routines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Medical data were retrieved for 524 of the 578 cases of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> reported during the period 1987-1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A history of reflux symptoms or a diagnosis compatible with reflux was reported in 113 of 524 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 119 patients (23%) had previously been investigated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> or reflux symptoms, most often by endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A previous diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was found in only 1.3% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in Denmark has increased eightfold over a 20-yr period, and this increase is not explained by changes in classification or diagnostic routines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More than 98% of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were found in patients who could not have entered endoscopic surveillance, as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had not been diagnosed before the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> may be an option for the individual patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but these screening programs are not likely to reduce the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in the general population </plain></SENT>
