<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging medical technology capable of generating high-resolution cross-sectional imaging of tissue microstructure in situ and in real time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assess the use and feasibility of OCT for real-time screening and diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and also review state-of-the-art OCT technology for endoscopic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: OCT imaging was performed as an adjunct to endoscopic imaging of the human esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time OCT (13-microm resolution) was used to perform image-guided evaluation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beam delivery was accomplished with a 1-mm diameter OCT catheter-probe that can be introduced into the accessory channel of a standard endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different catheter-probe imaging designs which performed linear and radial scanning were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Novel ultrahigh-resolution (1.1-microm resolution) and spectroscopic OCT techniques were used to image in vitro specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopic OCT images revealed distinct layers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human esophagus extending from the epithelium to the muscularis propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the presence of gland- and crypt-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> and the absence of layered structures were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> OCT images showed strong correlations with architectural <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ultrahigh-resolution OCT techniques achieved 1.1-microm image resolution in in vitro specimens and showed enhanced resolution of architectural features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spectroscopic OCT identified localized regions of wavelength-dependent optical scattering, enhancing the differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OCT technology with compact fiberoptic imaging probes can be used as an adjunct to endoscopy for real-time image-guided evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Linear and radial scan patterns have different advantages and limitations depending upon the application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ultrahigh-resolution and spectroscopic OCT techniques improve structural tissue recognition and suggest future potential for resolution and contrast enhancements in clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A new balloon catheter-probe delivery device is proposed for systematic imaging and screening of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
