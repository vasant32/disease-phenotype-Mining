<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The regeneration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> by squamous epithelium in 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> after endoscopic laser ablation in a reflux-free environment after successful antireflux surgery was prospectively examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had antireflux surgery, and healing of reflux was verified at postoperative endoscopy and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, in 11 patients, the whole Barrett's epithelium was ablated using endoscopic Nd-YAG laser energy in 1 to 8 sessions (mean, 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The needed energy was 965 to 11,173 joules (mean 4709), or about 1000 joules per centimeter of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients had no laser ablation but were treated by antireflux surgery and served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> laser-treated patients, the regenerated epithelium was histologically of squamous type in the tubular esophagus, but two patients still had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In controls, the length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The length of follow-up was 26 months after the last laser session and 21 months in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The regenerated esophageal epithelium arising after laser ablation in reflux-free environment surgery is of squamous type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This treatment may have a role in preventing the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
