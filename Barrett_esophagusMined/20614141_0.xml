<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes the authors' results with a new device and technique for strip endoscopic mucosal resection (SEMR) using a cold excision blade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of ex vivo and in vivo animal and human esophagi experiments was conducted to develop the essential design characteristics of a transoral strip mucosal excision device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Depth, size, shape, and technique of excision were serially evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SEMR device allows precise capsule positioning with satisfactory excision size and depth in ex vivo and in vivo experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 10 excisions were performed on five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ex vivo cadaveric human esophagi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specimens ranged in size from 3×2.5 to 2.5×2.2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average specimen thickness was 0.297 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For 147 (99.8%) of 150 fields of examination, muscularis mucosa was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six additional in vivo experiments demonstrated device safety and feasibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Satisfactory excision depth was reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further animal survival experiments and clinical trials will define the role of the SEMR device for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
