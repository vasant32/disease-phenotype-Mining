<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has been observed in individuals without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms, with prevalence up to 25% in 50 years older men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Assess the association between symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing endoscopy at our center were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before endoscopy, through a direct interview <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were asked to complete the Carlsson-Dent questionnaire for determining 2 groups (patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those subjects with suggestive image of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, biopsy specimens were obtained from the distal esophageal mucosa with the intention of find <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and nine patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> was 37.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was found in 9.7% of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> patients and in 9.6% of subjects without symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (p = 0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gender and age were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> hiatal was bigger in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (90 vs. 42%) (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study didn't show association between symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> detected by a questionnaire and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
