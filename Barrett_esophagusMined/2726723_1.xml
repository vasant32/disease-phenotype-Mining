<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two biopsies were taken from each of 4 areas of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One was processed for light microscopy (LM) and one for scanning electron microscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those in whom dysplastic BE was demonstrated by LM were reexamined at 6-mo intervals, and the others at yearly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) by LM on entry, and in 2 others, LGD was recognized on the second examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes have persisted in semiannual examinations over 3, 2, and 2 yr, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> prints were examined without knowledge of LM findings, and features that might correlate with LGD by LM were sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> findings were similar to those of Zwas et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(Gastroenterology 90:1932, 1986) in that most glandular cells had surface features unlike either gastric or intestinal cells but unique to BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the patient with LGD on entry, there was an aggregate of very large cells covered by short microvilli with bald patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the other patients with LGD, there was more variation in size and shape of cells than in nondysplastic cases </plain></SENT>
