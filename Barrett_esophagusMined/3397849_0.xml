<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a 4-month-old infant affected by severe reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> who developed a junctional-type Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histochemical procedures to detect mucin pattern were also carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was observed 4 months after antireflux surgery whereas medical therapy had been unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that esophageal biopsy should also be performed in the presence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up observations of other patients may clarify the role of antireflux surgery when <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> complicates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) </plain></SENT>
