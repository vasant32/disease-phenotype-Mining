<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) remains elusive in the general populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GOALS: The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence and clinical characteristics of BE in a Chinese general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY: Between June 2003 and December 2006, consecutive subjects were evaluated via upper gastrointestinal endoscopy during a routine health examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated for any abnormalities, including endoscopically suspected esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (ESEM) and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were attained from patients with ESEM to confirm a diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The demographic data and endoscopic findings were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 19,812 endoscopies performed, 56 patients (0.28%) were diagnosed with ESEM and 3129 patients (15.7%) with EE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 56 patients diagnosed with ESEM (0.06% of the total number of patients who underwent endoscopy) were confirmed to have BE after histologic analysis of the biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE were older than patients without BE (61.6 vs. 51.7 y), and only one of the 12 patients diagnosed with BE (8.3%) reported typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A majority of the BE patients were categorized as short-segment BE (91.7%) and concomitant EE was found in 4 (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Smoking, alcohol, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> seemed to be associated with the presence of BE and EE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of BE in a Chinese general population was lower than that in other reported studies, particularly in comparison with the studies originating from Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with advanced age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> are risk factors for developing BE </plain></SENT>
