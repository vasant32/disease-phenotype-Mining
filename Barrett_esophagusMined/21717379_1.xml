<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An overall complete reversal of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was achieved in 86 % with a combination of RFA and rescue endoscopic mucosal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median total follow-up is 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of strictures was 7 % (1/14) and there was a low rate of buried glands (0.5 % follow-up biopsies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest RFA is both safe and effective for eradication of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients in whom <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> has failed </plain></SENT>
