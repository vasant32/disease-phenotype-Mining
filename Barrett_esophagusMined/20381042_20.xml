<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the preliminary evaluation accuracy and interobserver agreement of probe-based CLE (pCLE) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind review of pCLE images of 40 sites of BE tissue by using matching biopsies as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A training set of 20 images with known histology was first reviewed to standardize image interpretation, followed by blinded review of 20 unknown images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Eleven experts in BE imaging from 4 different endoscopy centers from the United States and Europe evaluated the images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved nonconsecutive patients undergoing BE surveillance or evaluation of high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> pCLE imaging of each site within the BE segment, followed by matching biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity, specificity, and agreement for the pCLE diagnosis of high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the validation set (n = 20), 11 cases had high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> for the 11 endoscopists was 88% (range 6 of 11 to 11 of 11), and the specificity was 96% (range 7 of 9 to 9 of 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was substantial agreement on the pCLE diagnosis (86%, kappa 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endomicroscopists with prior pCLE experience had an overall sensitivity of 91% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 of 11), specificity of 100% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 of 9), and almost perfect agreement (92%, kappa 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and use of offline video sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results suggest that pCLE for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in BE has very high accuracy and reliability </plain></SENT>
