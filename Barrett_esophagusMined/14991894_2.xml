<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro, laminin, a component of the epithelial basement membrane (BM), is important in regulation of cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is limited information on the distribution of laminin chains in the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and none in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate qualitatively the distribution of laminins in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> upper GIT mucosa and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> in order to understand the role of laminins in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase staining for laminin chains alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, beta1, beta2, beta3, gamma1, and gamma2 was performed on frozen endoscopic squamous and Barrett's oesophageal biopsies and surgical resection specimens from squamous oesophagus (in resection specimens for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e>), and in oesophageal and gastric biopsies from control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>alpha1 laminin was expressed in the BM of submucosal glands and ducts in squamous oesophagus and Brunner's glands in the duodenum, but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> or elsewhere in the upper GIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>alpha2 laminin chain was expressed in a granular distribution in the BM of squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In columnar epithelium, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, alpha2 laminin chain was expressed continuously in the BM of glands and deeper pits, but expression was reduced and granular in the surface epithelial BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>beta2 laminin was continuous in squamous epithelial BM, but in Barrett's and cardia, gastric body, and duodenum, it was expressed faintly in the surface but continuously in the BM of glands and deeper pits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The constituents of laminin-5 were continuously expressed in the BM of squamous epithelium, but in the cardia, gastric body, duodenum, and Barrett's, they were expressed only in the BM of surface epithelium, with a sharp decline in the glandular and deeper pit BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Site-specific distribution of the alpha2 and beta2 laminin chains may therefore have an important role in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the absence of alpha1 laminin in Barrett's mucosa suggests that this is unlikely to play an important role in columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
