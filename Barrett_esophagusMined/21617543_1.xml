<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval, first-degree relatives of patients with EAC/HGD underwent unsedated ultrathin transnasal endoscopy (UUTNE) with biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BE was suspected if any salmon-colored epithelial tongues were seen above the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of BE was made only if biopsy from these areas confirmed columnar-lined epithelium with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 23 families, 47 first-degree relatives underwent ultrathin transnasal endoscopy and 1 patient underwent routine upper endoscopy with sedation as part of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of cases was 44.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients tolerated the procedure well and there were no procedure-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BE was suspected in 16 (34%) patients and confirmed in 13 of 16 (27.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 4 long segments (&gt;3 cm) and 9 short segments (&lt;3 cm) of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a significantly higher than expected prevalence of BE in first-degree relatives of patients with EAC/HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This should be taken in to consideration to develop further screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further work is needed to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Unsedated transnasal endoscopy is a safe and well-tolerated method for BE screening </plain></SENT>
