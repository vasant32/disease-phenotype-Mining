<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously described a method that permits percutaneous replacement of surgically placed jejunostomy feeding tubes, and now present our results with the use of this technique in 350 consecutive esophagogastrectomy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Replacement jejunostomy as required in 17 patients (4.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had successful percutaneous jejunostomy replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no procedural complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The timing of feeding tube replacement following esophagogastrectomy was predictive of the indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before 16 weeks, the indication for feeding tube replacement was intubation and inability to eat (1 patient) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> (7 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At or after 16 weeks, the indications for feeding tube replacement were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> related to symptoms resulting from recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the technique of percutaneous jejunostomy allows the surgeon tremendous flexibility in the management of the postesophagogastrectomy patient as it preserves the advantages of an adjuvant surgically placed feeding tube over the lifetime of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The technique is safe, and the success rate is excellent </plain></SENT>
