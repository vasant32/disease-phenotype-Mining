<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of symptomatology and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the diagnosis of proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the symptoms and EGD findings of 100 consecutive patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients' symptoms were scored at their first visit with a standardized symptom scoring system (grades 0-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 symptoms were the most severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EGD findings were classified according to the modified Savary-Miller scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Esophageal acid exposure was quantified using 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring; a positive composite score was considered evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients had positive pH scores, and 43 were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of grade 2 or 3 heartburn and/or regurgitation with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> on EGD had a 97 per cent specificity and 64 per cent sensitivity for accurately diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that, in the presence of moderate to severe symptoms and endoscopic injury, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> can be made without further studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring is still indicated in patients with mild typical symptoms, atypical symptoms, or when the combination of heartburn and regurgitation, regardless of their severity, occurs in the absence of severe mucosal damage </plain></SENT>
