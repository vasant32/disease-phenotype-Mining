<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified individuals diagnosed with BE in the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked their information with that from England's Hospital Episode Statistics database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients (N = 8448) were matched with individuals without BE for age, sex, and general practice (controls, N = 155,212) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were obtained from the UK's Office for National Statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard regression, excluding data from the first year of follow-up, was used to estimate hazard ratios and cumulative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absolute excess risks were calculated by subtracting cause-specific mortality values of controls from those of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control population, patients with BE had increased risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and from respiratory and digestive causes but not from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_105'>circulatory disorders</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annual mortality rate from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> among patients with BE was 0.14%; 4.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among these patients resulted from this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, leading to a cumulative 10-year risk of almost 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the largest single cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among patients with BE was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (5.6 per 1000 patients); 168 patients with BE died of this cause, nearly 4-fold the number that died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with BE, approximately 2% will die of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> within 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, patients with BE died more frequently of other causes, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evidence-based strategies are available to prevent this disease and might be more cost-effective for reducing mortality among patients with BE </plain></SENT>
