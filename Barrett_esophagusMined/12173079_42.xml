<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: In recent years, short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) has attracted increasing attention in the context of reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is continuing controversy regarding its potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1996 and September 1999, 50/115 patients (43 %) with intraepithelial high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or early Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, who underwent local endoscopic treatment, had developed a malignant lesion in an (SSBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the framework of a prospective observational study, 28 patients were treated with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), 13 with photodynamic therapy, and three with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation; six patients received combinations of these treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete local remission was achieved in 48/49 patients (98 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient switched to surgery after the first EMR, because there was submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltration, and in one patient out of 50 local endoscopic treatment failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mean of 1.7 +/- 1.4 treatment sessions was required for local endoscopic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The method-associated mortality was 0 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of relevant complications (stenosis, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>) was 6 % (3/50 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No cases of severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (Hb fall &gt;2 g/dl) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 34 +/- 10 months, metachronous intraepithelial high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> or early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were seen in 11/48 patients (23 %), who received further successful endoscopic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients died during the follow-up period, but in only one patient was this due to his Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (this was the patient who underwent esophageal resection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The malignant potential of short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> must not be underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Organ-preserving local endoscopic treatment shows good <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase and long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Local endoscopic treatment represents an alternative to esophageal resection in the case of intraepithelial high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and selected early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
