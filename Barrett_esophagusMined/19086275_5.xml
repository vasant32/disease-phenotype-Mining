<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about its pathogenesis and significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between ectopic gastric tissue development and endoscopic features of the upper gastrointestinal tract, especially in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 9437 endoscopic examinations were analyzed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic features and histological examinations of inlet patch and stomach specimens were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings in patients with inlet patch were compared with those in patients without inlet patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inlet patch was present in 171 (1.8%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-three (25.1%) patients with inlet patch and 519 (5.6%) patients without inlet patch had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was more frequent among patients with inlet patch than among patients without inlet patch (3.5% versus 0.5%, p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prevalences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> in the two groups were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Open cardia was diagnosed more frequently in the inlet patch group than in the other group (24.5% versus 10.0%, p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Helicobacter pylori colonization was detected in only 11% of inlet patch specimens, whereas 58% of stomach specimens from the same patients contained H. pylori colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inlet patch seem to have predisposing factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is found more frequently in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>H. pylori colonization is involved in ectopic gastric tissue less frequently than in gastric tissue </plain></SENT>
