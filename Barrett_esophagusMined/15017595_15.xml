<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although clinically important, histological distinction between both conditions by endoscopic biopsies is considered problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 4-mm samples of BIM (n=31) and CIM (n=9) were selected from esophagectomy specimens that had been resected for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Slides were coded and stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E), Alcian blue-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>), cytokeratins (CK) 7 and 20, and CD10, which labels the intestinal brush border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of these stains for the recognition of BIM and CIM was evaluated independently by two senior pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the use of H&amp;E-stained slides exclusively, BIM samples were categorized correctly in 93.5% and 83.9% of cases (pathologists 1 and 2, respectively), and CIM samples, in 100% and 88.9% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alcian blue-<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-positive goblet cells were identified by both investigators in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BIM and CIM samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BIM-typical CK 7 and 20 immunostaining pattern was identified in 90.3%/83.9% of BIM but only in 11.1%/11.1% of CIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD10-positive brush border was present in 32.3%/25.8% of BIM and in 88.9%/88.9% of CIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When HE-stained slides and immunohistologically stained slides were used together for tissue recognition, BIM were categorized correctly in 90.3%/80.6% of cases, and CIM, in 88.9%/88.9% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, BIM and CIM can be usually distinguished on the basis of HE sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CK 7 and CK 20 expression pattern analysis discriminates correctly between BIM and CIM in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CD10-positive intestinal brush border is present in the majority of CIM but only in a minority of BIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, immunohistochemical investigations could not improve the diagnostic accuracy of HE histology alone </plain></SENT>
