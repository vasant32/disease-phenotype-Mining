<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">Proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) represent, therefore, the first choice medical treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, in that they are able to provide an 80-85% healing rate for esophageal lesions, a 56-76% symptom relief and also reduce the incidence of complications, such as strictures as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to a widely quoted systematic review, compared to patients with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, patients with non-erosive reflux disease (i.e., NERD) display a reduced symptom relief with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>, with about 20% reduction of therapeutic gain </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study shows clearly that, when the diagnosis is accurately made by including a functional test, NERD patients respond to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy in a similar way to those with erosive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although not as frequent as previously suggested, however, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>-refractory heartburn does exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some 20% (range: 15-27%) of correctly diagnosed and appropriately treated patients do not respond to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment at standard doses </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A better and more predictable form of acid suppression should therefore be pursued </plain></SENT>
