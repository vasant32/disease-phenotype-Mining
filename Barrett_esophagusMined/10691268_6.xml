<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The presence of squamous epithelium in the stomach has been rarely noted in the past with only <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> case reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the stomach and a variety of other pathological processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the documentation, over a period of 9 months, of squamous epithelium extending beyond the esophagogastric junction and into the proximal stomach in 16 patients who underwent upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This newly recognized mucosal abnormality was systematically identified by both antegrade and retrograde views of the esophagogastric junction during routine upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other associated mucosal abnormalities were also evaluated (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, etc.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were obtained from the distal esophagus, cardia, antrum and the squamous extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent a detailed interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the patients, 14 were Caucasian and two Hispanic; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were males, with a mean age 61.2+/-4.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indications for upper endoscopy included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> surveillance, failure of antireflux treatment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heartburn was reported by 12 patients (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients reported a history of corrosive injury, foreign body ingestion or surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 12 patients had a solitary tongue of squamous cell extension, three had two tongues and in addition, two had squamous islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in six (37.5 %), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Squamous cell extension into the proximal stomach is a newly recognized mucosal abnormality with presently unknown clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This mucosal abnormality may represent an esophageal mucosal response to proximal gastric injury </plain></SENT>
