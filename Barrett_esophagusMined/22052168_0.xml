<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> (1 case each of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) and present literature review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: Both of our patients had common symptoms of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We were unable to identify any specific predisposing factors for either <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (caustic ingestion, reflux disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (caustic ingestion, inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both patients responded poorly to chemotherapy and died of progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On account of the rarity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> in this age group, there are no management guidelines for the pediatric oncologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is a strong need for collaborative efforts between adult and pediatric oncologists to establish cooperative diagnostic and therapeutic protocols for successful management of rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric tumors</z:e> like <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
