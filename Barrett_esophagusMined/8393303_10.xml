<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of esophageal squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> is not known, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mucosal irritation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850011,C0850009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">human papillomavirus</z:e> are two proposed etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate these hypotheses, we analyzed the clinical data and histological features of 38 esophageal squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papillomas</z:mpath> from 33 patients and performed the polymerase chain reaction technique for detection of several common human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> virus types on a subset of cases (n = 26) with sufficient available material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, males were affected more often than females (M:F ratio = 24:9); average age was 50 (range, 2-86 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papillomas</z:mpath> occurred singly (85%) and were located in the distal esophagus (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with esophageal squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papillomas</z:mpath>, especially those with lesions in the distal esophagus, commonly had an associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and often severe form of esophageal mucosal irritation such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Esophageal squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papillomas</z:mpath> were small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (average size, 0.5 cm) that we classified histologically into three types (exophytic, 50%; endophytic, 37%; spiked, 13%) based on the predominant shape of the squamous papillae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papillomas</z:mpath> (13 of 26) tested, from 57% of patients (12 of 21), were positive for human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> virus, most commonly type 16 (nine of 13), less often type 16 and 18 together (3/13), and rarely type 6b/11 (1 of 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose a multifactorial etiology in which the synergistic action of mucosal irritation and human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> virus may be necessary for the development of esophageal squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papillomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
