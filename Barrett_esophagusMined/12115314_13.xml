<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the actual use and clinical impact of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in screening and surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort included 1633 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (777 esophagus, 856 cardia) who were 70 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were diagnosed between 1993 and 1996 and were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> claims for upper endoscopy and a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> from 1991 through 1 year before diagnosis were identified from linked Medicare files </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One or more upper endoscopies before diagnosis were performed in 9.7% of patients (13.0% esophagus, 6.8% cardia) and a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> was present in only 3.7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A shift toward earlier stage at diagnosis was observed in patients with previous endoscopy or Barrett diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For example, 62% of patients with esophageal and 49% of patients with cardia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> who underwent previous endoscopy presented with in situ or local stage <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, compared with 35% and 27% of other patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Receipt of endoscopy was also associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (relative hazard 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.57-0.93; P = 0.01), but not for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of upper endoscopy at least 1 year before diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, which may reflect prediagnosis screening, was associated with an earlier <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data support the role of endoscopic screening and surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and highlight the underdiagnosis of populations at risk </plain></SENT>
