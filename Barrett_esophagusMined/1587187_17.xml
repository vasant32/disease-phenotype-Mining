<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with both classic manometric findings of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> and endoscopic findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004791'>esophageal ulcerations</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were compared to nine patients with similar endoscopic findings but with no evidence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> patients had significantly fewer reflux events (P less than 0.01), but the reflux events had significantly longer duration (P less than 0.01) compared to patients with similar severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that decreased smooth muscle peristalsis appears to be the primary contributor to acid exposure and esophageal injury in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
