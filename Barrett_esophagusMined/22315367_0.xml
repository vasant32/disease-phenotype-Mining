<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have previously established aberrant DNA methylation of vimentin exon-1 (VIM methylation) as a common epigenetic event in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and as a biomarker for detecting colon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now examine vimentin methylation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of the upper gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a quantitative real-time methylation-specific PCR assay, we tested for vimentin methylation in archival specimens of esophageal and gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We find that acquisition of aberrant vimentin methylation is highly common in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, but largely absent in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest frequency of vimentin methylation was detected in lesions of the distal esophagus, including 91% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 11), 100% of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD, n = 5), and 81% of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC, n = 26) but absent in controls (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vimentin methylation similarly was detected in 87% of signet ring (n = 15) and 53% of intestinal type <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in tests of cytology brushings vimentin methylation proved detectable in 100% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cases (n = 7), 100% of HGD cases (n = 4), and 83% of EAC cases (n = 18) but was absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish aberrant vimentin methylation as a highly common epigenetic alteration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of the upper gastrointestinal tract and show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, even without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, already contains epigenetic alterations characteristic of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: These findings suggest vimentin methylation as a biomarker of upper gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> with potential for development as molecular cytology in esophageal screening </plain></SENT>
