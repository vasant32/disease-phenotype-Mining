<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although a combination of genomic and epigenetic alterations are implicated in the multistep transformation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal epithelium to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the combinatorial effect of these changes is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By integrating genome-wide DNA methylation, copy number, and transcriptomic datasets obtained from endoscopic biopsies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> within the same individual, we are uniquely able to define the molecular events associated progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We find that the previously reported global hypomethylation phenomenon in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> has its origins at the earliest stages of epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Promoter hypomethylation synergizes with gene amplification and leads to significant upregulation of a chr4q21 chemokine cluster and other transcripts during Barrett <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, gene-specific hypermethylation is observed at a restricted number of loci and, in combination with hemi-allelic deletions, leads to downregulatation of selected transcripts during multistep progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observe that epigenetic regulation during epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> is not restricted to traditionally defined "CpG islands," but may also occur through a mechanism of differential methylation outside of these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, validation of novel upregulated targets (CXCL1 and 3, GATA6, and DMBT1) in a larger independent panel of samples confirms the utility of integrative analysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> biomarker discovery </plain></SENT>
