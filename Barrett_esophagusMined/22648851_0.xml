<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were divided into 3 groups: model group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> group, and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rat surgical model was established by performing a gastrojejunostomy plus an esophagojejunostomy 5 mm distal to the gastrojejunal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight weeks after surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals were sacrificed and the pathological changes in the esophagus were examined macroscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>COX-2 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">Prostaglandin E2</z:chebi>(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the model group was 84% and 57% respectively, significantly higher than those in the control group(P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>-treated group was significantly lower than that in the model group(P&lt;0.01), and no esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was detected in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>COX-2 expression was detected in 100% of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, but not found in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue from the esophagus and the jejunum(P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> level in the esophageal tissue in the model group was significantly higher than that in the control group(P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rats in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>-treated group had significantly lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> level than that in the model group(P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> than those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>(P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> successfully prevents the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in a rat surgical model with mixed reflux of acid and duodenal juice and significantly decreases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>COX-2 maybe an effective selective target of chemoprevention for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
