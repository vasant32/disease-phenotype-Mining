<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare clinical, endoscopic, histological, and functional features in patients with LSBE, SSBE, and IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 582 patients who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the squamocolumnar junction in the distal esophagus and divided them into three groups based on the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> observed endoscopically: 1) patients with IMC who had no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (i.e., the squamocolumnar and gastroesophageal junctions coincided), 2) patients with LSBE who had &gt;3 cm of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e>, and 3) patients with SSBE who had &lt;3 cm of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had esophageal manometric evaluation, and 24-h esophageal pH monitoring was performed to determine the extent of acid and bile (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>) reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 174 patients with IMC, 155 with LSBE, and 25 with SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients with LSBE and SSBE, patients with IMC had significantly lower frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>; significantly higher lower esophageal sphincter pressures; and significantly shorter durations of acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between patients with SSBE and LSBE, significant differences were found in the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> (both greater in the patients with LSBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was significantly more frequent in patients with LSBE than in those with SSBE or IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, signs, and physiological abnormalities are found more often in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> than in those with IMC, and the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> in patients with LSBE is greater than that in patients with SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the esophagus is related directly to the severity of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
