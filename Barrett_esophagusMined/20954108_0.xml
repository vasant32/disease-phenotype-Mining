<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent EA/TEF correction were followed up over an 18-year period (1990-2009) with regular pH probe and endoscopy investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were performed at 3 year intervals to evaluate for metaplastic changes in the esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> correction and the development of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The development of complicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> was statistically correlated to age at detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 51 patients (28 male) underwent EA/TEF correction during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ages of the children followed up ranged from 7 months to 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 5 Type A, 44 Type C and 2 Type D <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>37 patients (5 Type A, 31 Type C, 1 Type D) had documented reflux and 14 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>17 (46%) of the patients with reflux underwent an anti-reflux operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>4 of the 17 underwent 2 or more anti-reflux procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>21 patients had pH probe studies positive for reflux, 3 had negative pH probe studies after an anti-reflux operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>18 of the 37 patients with reflux (about 50%) needed esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> for either anastamotic or non-anastamotic strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only 4/14 (28.5%) patients without reflux underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> and only in their first year of life (p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>15 patients had mucosal abnormalities in endoscopic biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>8 patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> and 1 patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The mean age in the group with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (gastric and intestinal) was 13 years, which was significantly different from the mean age of the group (5.2 years) without mucosal changes (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>2 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pH probe studies had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> on biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>Metaplasia</z:mpath> arises in about 15% of patients with EA/TEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The lag time to developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> from the time of initial surgical correction is about 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy and biopsies are the best way of detecting mucosal changes </plain></SENT>
