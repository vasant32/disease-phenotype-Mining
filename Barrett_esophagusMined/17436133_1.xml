<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to analyse pH- and bile-monitoring data in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and in age- and gender-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive Barrett's patients (8 females, 16 males, mean age 57 years), 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (10 females, 11 males, mean age 58 years), and 19 healthy controls (8 females, 11 males, mean age 51 years), were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only patients underwent endoscopy with biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups were investigated with manometry, gastric and esophageal 24-h pH, and simultaneous bile monitoring according to a standardized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> absorption&gt;0.25 was determined as noxious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) method was applied to determine the optimal cutoff value of pathologic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of Barrett's patients, 79% had pathologic acidic gastric reflux (pH&lt;4&gt;5% of total measuring time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, 32% of healthy controls also had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> (p&lt;0.05) without any symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median of esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> was 7.8% (lower quartile (LQ)-upper quartile (UQ)=1.6-17.8%) in Barrett's patients, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 3.5% (LQ-UQ=0.1-13.5), and in contrast to 0% (LQ-UQ=0-1.0%) in controls, p=0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ROC analysis showed the optimal dividing value for patients at more than 1% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> over 24 h (75% sensitivity, 84% specificity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An optimal threshold to differentiate between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> into the esophagus is 1% (24-h bile monitoring with an absorbance&gt;0.25) </plain></SENT>
