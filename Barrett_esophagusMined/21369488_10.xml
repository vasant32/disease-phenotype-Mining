<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrieved the studies which have been published regarding the epidemiologic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) in Asia, based on the definitions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, study settings, publication years and geographical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the population-based studies, the prevalence of symptom-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in Eastern Asia was found to be 2.5%-4.8% before 2005 and 5.2%-8.5% from 2005 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Southeast and Western Asia, it was 6.3%-18.3% after 2005, which was much higher than those in Eastern Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were robust epidemiologic data of endoscopic reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in medical check-up participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of endoscopic reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in Eastern Asia increased from 3.4%-5.0% before 2000, to 4.3%-15.7% after 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there were only limited studies, the prevalence of extra-esophageal syndromes in Asia was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> group than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was 0.06%-0.84% in the health check-up participants, whereas it was 0.31%-2.00% in the referral hospital settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, the prevalence of symptom-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and endoscopic reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> has increased in Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in Asia has not changed and also still rare </plain></SENT>
