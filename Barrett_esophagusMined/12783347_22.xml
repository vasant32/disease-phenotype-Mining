<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is a major risk factor for oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, a condition which is rapidly increasing in incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) is a developing treatment in which tissue damage is caused by the action of light on a previously administered photosensitizing agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the results of long-term follow-up of its efficacy in patients with dysplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 40 patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were treated with oral 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) at a dose of 30 mg/kg, followed by laser endoscopy 4 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated between December 1995 and December 1998, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were followed up regularly with endoscopy and biopsies in our surveillance programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the patients, 35 (88%) showed a macroscopic reduction in the area of the columnar epithelium, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 40 patients <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found to be eradicated at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect has been maintained for a median follow-up of 53 months (range 18-68 months), although one patient developed a late <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in an untreated area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> 3 years after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Safe and effective ablation of low-grade dysplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> can be achieved with the use of ALA-induced <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, and the effects are maintained in the long term </plain></SENT>
