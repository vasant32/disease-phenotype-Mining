<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic management often differs based on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is limited information on the difference in outcomes for T1b-EAC with and without esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate (1) the outcomes of T1b EAC treatments with and without esophagectomy and (2) the percentage of LNM at esophagectomy for T1b-EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Sixty-eight T1b EAC patients based on EMR histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Esophagectomy and endoscopic therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Survival duration and mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 68 patients had T1b EAC; cumulative mortality rate was 30.9% and median survival duration was 39.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine underwent esophagectomy and 29 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among patients who underwent esophagectomy, 13 (33.3%) had LNM, and the mortality rate was 50.0% and 11.1% for those with and without LNM, respectively (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For those with and without esophagectomy, the cumulative mortality rates were 25.6% and 37.9%, and median survival duration was 48.9 and 34.8 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference in Charlson comorbidity index, number of EMRs, mortality rate, or survival duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In Cox proportional hazard model analysis, the hazard ratio for esophagectomy was 0.5 (P = .21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective, nonrandomized small sample size cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among the patients with T1b EAC found in EMR specimens who underwent esophagectomy, one third had regional LNM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In our small series, patients who underwent esophagectomy did not have a significantly different survival duration from that of those who did not, indicating that these patients may have similar outcomes [corrected] </plain></SENT>
