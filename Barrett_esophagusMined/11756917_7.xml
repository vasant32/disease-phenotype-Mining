<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The histologic presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the esophagus is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, use of the term <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to describe certain endoscopic features in the distal esophagus is inappropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is no accepted classification system for the endoscopic description of the squamocolumnar mucosal junction, the so-called "Z-line." Furthermore, no clear definition of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Z-line exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A classification of the Z-line appearance has been proposed: the ZAP classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility of this classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten physicians with varying endoscopy experience were presented with 15 endoscopic photographs of the Z-line and were asked to classify them according to the ZAP classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A second assessment was conducted between 7 and 15 weeks after the first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median kappa values were in the range of 0.72 to 0.90 with regard to intraobserver as well as interobserver reproducibility, irrespective of experience with upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of the ZAP classification is substantial and thus it is feasible to use this classification to characterize the appearance of the Z-line at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
