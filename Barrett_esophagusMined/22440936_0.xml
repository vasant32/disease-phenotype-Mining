<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess p16 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene alterations in the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant conditions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL &amp; METHODS: In the present study two p16 gene mutations (A148T and I49S) analysis with PCR- RFLP method have been performed in oesophageal biopsy specimen in 33 patients with Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> (GM), 27 - with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM), 8 - with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 11 - with <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have detected the I49S mutation in 12% (4/33) patients with GM, 18% (5/27) with IM, 50% - with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (4/8) and in 27% (3/11) - with <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The A148T mutation were found in 3% (1/33) patients with GM, 22% (6/27) - IM, 25% (2/8) - <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 27% patients with <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> (3/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the A148S mutation was rising in GM - IM - <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> - <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> sequence and was significantly lower in GM compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other grades taken together (p=0.0256) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the I49S mutation was rising in GM - IM - <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> sequence, to drop in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in frequency of the I49S mutation between studied groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis on the role of the p16 mutations in early phase of Barrett's epithelium progression to <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of p16 mutations in esophageal metaplastic columnar epithelium without goblet cells suggest that this pathology may have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> potential </plain></SENT>
