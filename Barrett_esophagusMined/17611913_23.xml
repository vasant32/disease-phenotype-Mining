<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective randomized pilot study with a crossover design was to compare CVC with conventional chromoendoscopy with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> (CAA) for the detection of high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS:57 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (mean length 3.8 cm) and a history of HGIN/early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or suspected HGIN/early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were randomly allocated to undergo either CAA or CVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were re-examined with the alternative procedure at 4 - 6 weeks after the initial endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two procedures were performed by five endoscopists, who were blinded to the findings of the other examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At each examination, targeted biopsies were taken from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> detected lesions, followed by random four-quadrant biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 24/57 patients, 30 lesions with HGIN/early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of targeted biopsies for HGIN/early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> on a 'per lesion' basis was 87 % (26/30) for both CAA and CVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value was 39 % (26/66) for CAA and 37 % (26/70) for CVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 'per patient' analysis, sensitivity was 83 % (20/24) and 92 % (22/24) for CAA and CVC, respectively ( P = 0.617) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stepwise random four-quadrant biopsies identified only one patient with HGIN/early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> that was missed by both, CAA and CVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Computed virtual chromoendoscopy is a helpful adjunct for surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and appears to be as accurate as conventional chromoendoscopy in the detection of HGIN/early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
