<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability of this drug to decrease <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> contents in human esophageal tissues has not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were treated with DFMO at a dose of 1.5 g/m2/day for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four sites (Barrett's lesion, adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus, gastric tissue, and small bowel) were biopsied in each patient before, during, and after DFMO treatment in order to assess the effects of this drug on tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">Ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase activities and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> contents varied in each site analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rank orders were Barrett's &gt; small bowel congruent to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus &gt; gastric tissue for <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> activities, and small bowel &gt; or = Barrett's congruent to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus &gt; gastric tissue for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> contents </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systemic DFMO treatment did not affect the levels of either of these two <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> in gastric tissue and small bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since DFMO can suppress <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> contents in several gastrointestinal tissues, including Barrett's mucosa, we conclude that it is an effective agent with which to test the hypothesis that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">spermidine</z:chebi> contents may prevent the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus in this specific patient group </plain></SENT>
