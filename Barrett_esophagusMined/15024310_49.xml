<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) in Barrett's epithelium and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and the impact of NF-kappaB expression on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is associated with a wide range of cellular and molecular abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) regulates several genes involved in inflammatory, immune and apoptotic responses, but its role in <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mobility shift assay was used to measure NF-kappaB activity in nuclear extracts of fresh-frozen biopsies from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and uninvolved tissues (n = 30) and esophageal cell lines OE33, SKGT-4, and OE21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RelA expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining (n = 97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NF-kappaB/RelA and IkappaB protein expressions were also examined by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NF-kappaB was not expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous epithelium, in contrast to increased expression in 40% of patients with Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one percent of resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (n = 97) displayed NF-kappaB immunoreactivity, and 87.5% of the NF-kappaB-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were Stage IIb and III compared with only 12.5% of patients with Stage I and IIa disease (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of NF-kappaB inversely correlated with major or complete pathologic responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with 15/20 (75%) responders in the NF-kappaB-negative group compared with 7/38 (18%) in the NF-kappaB-positive group (P &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, incubation of esophageal cell lines OE33, SKGT-4, and OE21 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> or low pH induced NF-kappaB expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">Bile acids</z:chebi> and low pH induce NF-kappaB expression in esophageal cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB activation is common in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with Barrett's epithelium and an associated esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, there is a progressive expression of NF-kappaB through Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The absence of NF-kappaB expression in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> correlates with response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and may be of value in predicting response to neoadjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
