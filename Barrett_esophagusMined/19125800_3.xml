<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9-CM code used for BE, 530.2, is also used for patients with '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> of the esophagus.' We aimed to determine if the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9-CM code of 530.2 is reliable for identifying cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> within databases for research purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients assigned code 530.2 at two university medical center hospitals and a veterans' administration hospital over a cumulative 16-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Billing records provided information about where the code was assigned, whether it was a major or minor diagnosis, and if the code was assigned on multiple occasions for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histology and endoscopy records were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 435 patients with code 530.2 in their records, 354 (82%) had an esophageal biopsy reported and 393 (90%) had an endoscopy report available for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 182 (42%) had specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> documented in a biopsy from an area of salmon-colored mucosa arising above the esophagogastric junction (51% of those with histology available) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 288 patients (66%) with an endoscopic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (73% of those with an endoscopy reported) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Variables associated with documented specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were age &gt; or = 60 (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.4-3.7), multiple assignments of 530.2 (OR 3.2; 95% CI 2.0-5.0), and assignment of 530.2 in a gastrointestinal (GI) clinic or an endoscopy unit (OR 3.5; 95% CI 2.0-6.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of the code being assigned in a GI location was 48% (95% CI 43-54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9-CM code of 530.2 is not specific for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The usage of code 530.2 in a GI setting was not sufficiently predictive of BE to be reliable for rigorous epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
