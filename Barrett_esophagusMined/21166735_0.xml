<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, a mouse model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> based on a zinc-deficient diet supplemented with deoxycholic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> has been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to attempt to reproduce these data and extend them by employing genetically modified mice and intraperitoneal iron supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study design encompassed six experimental groups (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, Apc-mutant and Smad4-mutant mice, with or without iron injections), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals fed with the zinc-deficient diet supplemented with deoxycholic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatments were started at 3-5 weeks of age (the majority [78%] at 5 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were scheduled for euthanasia at two distinct time points, namely at 3 and 6 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mice showed signs of considerable distress already 4 weeks after the start of the modified diets, and had to be euthanized before the first evaluation time point (mean age 9.3 weeks, range 5-15 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and genetically modified mice, or between animals with or without iron supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On histological examination, we could not detect any lesions (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>-like or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>) other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the currently presented experimental settings, we were not able to reproduce the mouse model according to which Barrett's-like lesions could be detected in animals fed with the zinc-deficient diet supplemented with deoxycholic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
