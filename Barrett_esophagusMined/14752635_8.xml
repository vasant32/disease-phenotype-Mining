<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is the major risk factor for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the incidence of which is increasing rapidly in the Western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">Aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> for photodynamic therapy (ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) is effective in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but controversy exists regarding optimum ALA dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish the optimum dosage regime for ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were randomized to receive 30 (low-dose) or 60 (high-dose) mg/kg oral ALA at 4 or 6 h or 30 mg/kg in two fractions 4 and 6 h before <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was standardized using red (635 nm) light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were taken for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi>) quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy was repeated 4 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed a macroscopic response, with squamous re-epithelialization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This response was greatest in the 30 mg/kg and fractionated ALA groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in response between dosing 4 or 6 h prior to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tissue levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> were similar for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dosage groups and were not predictive of clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Side effects were more common with the higher dose of ALA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low-dose ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> appears to be a safe protocol for the ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
