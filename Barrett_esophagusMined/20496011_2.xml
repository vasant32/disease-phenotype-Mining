<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: C1q, an element of the first component of complement, is known to be expressed by interdigitating and follicular dendritic cells in the spleen, where it has been suggested that C1q is involved in capturing immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated whether C1q is expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and, if so, whether its expression is associated with dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Endoscopic biopsy or operative surgical specimens were obtained from 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 13 patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 12 patients whose biopsy specimens did not show the presence of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was diagnosed by the presence of a macroscopic area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> as well as microscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry utilizing anti-C1q and markers for dendritic cells and macrophages was performed on sections of tissue samples embedded in paraffin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double immunostaining with C1q/CD83 and C1q/CD68 was used to analyze the possible co-localization of C1q with dendritic cells and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of C1q by dendritic cells and macrophages was also examined in in vitro studies using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens studied, C1q expression was detected as being distributed irregularly throughout the lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A computerized quantitative analysis showed that C1q expression was significantly higher in tissue specimens without specialized intestinal-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> specimens and specimens with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Double immunostaining revealed that dendritic cells and macrophages expressed C1q in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyzed esophageal specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of C1q by dendritic cells and macrophages was also demonstrated in in vitro studies using RT-PCR and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that reduced levels of the expression of C1q by dendritic cells and macrophages in the esophagus may play a role in the formation of immune responses associated with the formation of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
