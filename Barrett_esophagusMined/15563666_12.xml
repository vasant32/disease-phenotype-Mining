<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) are at risk of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the pattern of mucosal mucins changes during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>, it may serve as a marker of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the expression pattern of mucins in neoplastic BO epithelium (high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) and correlate it with the expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> markers Bax and Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty seven patients with BO were studied: 16 without intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, six with high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGN), and 15 with infiltrating <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were obtained from squamous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1258085" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epithelium, Barrett</z:e>'s epithelium, and (when present) foci of suspected HGN or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MUC1-4, MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC6, Bax, and Bcl-2 mRNA were determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6 protein was determined by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mucin expression varied between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> stages in BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mucin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were low in squamous epithelium, except for MUC4, and were at least four times higher in BO and HGN (p&lt;0.001), but less so in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MUC4 expression was significantly lower in BO than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium, whereas in HGN and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, levels were significantly higher than in BO (p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Bax:Bcl-2 ratio was increased in HGN compared with BO (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6 protein values correlated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mucin expression varies during the development of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MUC4 could serve as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> marker in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In contrast to animal studies, upregulation of MUC4 in HGN is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp>, suggesting that MUC4 plays a minor role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> regulation in BO </plain></SENT>
