<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether there is any appreciable difference in imaging characteristics between high-resolution magnification white-light endoscopy (WLE-Z) and narrow-band imaging (NBI-Z) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BE) and if this translates into superior prediction of histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective single-centre study involving 21 patients (75 areas, corresponding NBI-Z and WLE-Z images) with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mucosal patterns (pit pattern and microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>) were evaluated for their image quality on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 1-10 by five expert endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The endoscopists then predicted mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> based on four subtypes which can be visualized in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type A: round pits, regular microvasculature; type B: villous/ridge pits, regular microvasculature; type C: absent pits, regular microvasculature; type D: distorted pits, irregular microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy (Acc) were then compared with the final histopathological analysis and the interobserver variability calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall pit and microvasculature quality was significantly higher for NBI-Z, pit: NBI-Z=6, WLE-Z=4.5, p &lt; 0.001; microvasculature: NBI-Z=7.3, WLE-Z=4.9, p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This translated into a superior prediction of histology (Sn: NBI-Z: 88.9, WLE-Z: 71.9, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the prediction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, NBI-Z was superior to WLE-Z (chi(2)=10.3, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall kappa agreement among the five endoscopists for NBI-Z and WLE-Z, respectively, was 0.59 and 0.31 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NBI-Z is superior to WLE-Z in the prediction of histology in BE, with good reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This novel imaging modality could be an important tool for surveillance of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
