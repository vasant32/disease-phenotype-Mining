<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) has a significant impact on patients' quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was (a) to evaluate and compare quality-of-life data before and after laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE); and (b) to compare quality-of-life data of these patients to normative data for a comparable general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) was administrated to 75 BE patients and to 174 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> without BE (Savary-Miller classification: grade 1: n = 49; grade 2: n = 69; grade 3: n = 56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire was given to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients preoperatively, 3months, 1 year, and 3 years after laparoscopic "floppy" Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before surgery, BE patients (mean: 96.8 +/- 9.3 points) had a better but not significant (p&lt;0.06) general score of the GIQLI when compared with patients without BE (mean: 86.4 +/- 10.1 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This difference is solely based on the subdimension "gastrointestinal symptoms" which means that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms are less intensively and frequently recognized in BE patients than in patients without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are no other differences in the other four subdimensions of the GIQLI between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three months, 1 year, and 3 years after LARS, GIQLI was significantly (p&lt;0.01) improved in both groups (BE patients mean after 3 years: 121.9 +/- 8.2 points; non-BE patients mean after 3 years: 122.8 +/- 9.3 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This improvement was significantly better (p&lt;0.05) in patients without BE than in BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, both groups scored significantly below average on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subscores of GIQLI compared to general population (mean: 122.6 +/- 8.5 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After surgery, there are no differences detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As our data show, non-BE patients undergoing LARS achieve a better quality-of-life improvement than those patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, after surgery GIQLI of both groups is comparable to the mean value of general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This means that LARS is able to improve quality of life significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients, with and without BE </plain></SENT>
