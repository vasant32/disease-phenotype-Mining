<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether iron intake and iron stores were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, a metaplastic change that is a strong risk factor for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a case-control study within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons with a new diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (cases); they were matched to persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) and to population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects completed examinations, dietary questionnaires, and testing for serum iron stores (ferritin and transferrin saturation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses used unconditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We evaluated 319 cases, 312 GERD patients, and 313 population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with population controls, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients had lower dietary iron intakes (4th vs 1st quartiles, odds ratio [OR]= 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.80), similar total iron intakes (including supplement use), and lower iron stores (4th vs 1st quartiles, ferritin OR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.14-0.40;% transferrin saturation OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.41-1.04; P value trend &lt;0.01 and 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar associations were observed in comparisons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> controls and among subjects without clear sources of blood loss on endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had lower dietary iron intakes and lower serum iron stores than controls in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings do not provide support for the current hypothesis that high iron stores or a high iron intake are risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, a potential early event in the carcinogenic sequence for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
