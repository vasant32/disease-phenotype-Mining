<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Redo cardiomyotomy is complicated and associated with rerecurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with failed redo myotomy were clinically evaluated with radiology, endoscopy, and manometry in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> type III or IV was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose as treatment for these selected cases an inversed Y cardioplasty + truncal vagotomy, a partial distal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy in order to facilitate esophageal emptying and avoid the appearance of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> as a side effect of this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient was reoperated on in order to enlarge the cardioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented reflux symptoms and were treated with 20 mg of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">Omeprazole</z:chebi> 20 twice/day </plain></SENT>
