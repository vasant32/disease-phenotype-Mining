<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various techniques are available for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in the GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The " suck and cut technique, which uses a transparent cap or modified multiband variceal ligator, is usually the most practiced method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A multiband ligator (ML) allows sequential resection without the need for submucosal injection and endoscope withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EMR with a ML device in the treatment of Barrett s high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight consecutive patients (4 men; median age, 62 years; range 38-89 years) with BHGD (4) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> (4) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EMR was performed with a multiband ligator in order to create a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudopolyp</z:e> and then permit snare polypectomy of flat mucosal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudopolyp</z:e> was resected by using pure coagulating current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No submucosal saline injection was administered before resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 8 consecutive patients were treated with the multiband ligator (ML) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Barrett s esophagus (BE): one patient with long BE received 3 EMR sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented with short BE and received 1 EMR session each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The histology of the EMR specimens confirmed a moderately differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with submucosal infiltration (1 patient) and BHGD (3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e>): 3 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> (type IIa) and 1 patient had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>EMR was accomplished in 1 session for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The histology of EMR specimens confirmed a mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with submucosal infiltration (1 patient), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> (2 patients), and HGD (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Complications (mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo>, minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>) occurred in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EMR has diagnostic and therapeutic implications, and represents a superior diagnostic modality as compared to traditional biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>By means of EMR the resected mucosa is pathologically examined, and the lesion may be appropriately treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>EMR-ML is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of superficial lesions of the digestive tract, and is accepted as an alternative to surgical therapy for non-invasive lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up is needed to determine the clinical impact of this method </plain></SENT>
