<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to identify the most effective and cost-effective strategy for managing high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without associated endoscopically visible abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By using decision analysis, the lifetime costs and benefits of 4 strategies for which long-term data exist were estimated by us: esophagectomy, endoscopic surveillance, photodynamic therapy, followed by esophagectomy for residual high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; and photodynamic therapy followed by endoscopic surveillance for residual high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was assumed by us that there was a 30% prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> patients and a 77% efficacy of photodynamic therapy for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Esophagectomy cost 24,045 dollars, with life expectancy of 11.82 quality-adjusted life years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In comparison, photodynamic therapy followed by surveillance for residual high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was the most effective strategy, with a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 12.31 quality-adjusted life years, but it also incurred the greatest lifetime cost (47,310 dollars) for an incremental cost-effectiveness of 47,410 dollars/quality-adjusted life years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were sensitive to post-surgical quality of life and survival, and to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevalence if photodynamic therapy efficacy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was less than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy followed by endoscopic surveillance for residual high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> appears to be cost effective compared with esophagectomy for patients diagnosed with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials directly comparing these strategies are warranted </plain></SENT>
