<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the relation between VIP plasma concentration and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure in 24 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean VIP plasma concentration in 14 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> was 25.6 +/- 0.75 pg/ml, significantly higher than the mean value observed in 10 patients with moderate reflux (18.9 +/- 0.67 pg/ml) (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean LES resting pressure was significantly lower in the group of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> than that observed in patients with moderate reflux (3 +/- 0.64 and 10.3 +/- 0.69 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean VIP plasma concentration in 11 healthy volunteers (20.6 +/- 0.65 pg/ml) was significantly lower than the mean value observed in the subgroup of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VIP values in patients with moderate reflux were not significantly different from those observed in our volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between LES pressure and VIP plasma level (r = -0.9253; p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it is possible that the decreased LES resting pressure observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> may be due to impairment of the VIPergic innervation, resulting in an increased local VIP release with possible overflow to peripheral plasma </plain></SENT>
