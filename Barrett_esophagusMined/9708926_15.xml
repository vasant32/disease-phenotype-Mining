<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a considerable degree of subjectivity and, therefore, substantial interobserver and intraobserver disagreement in the diagnosis and grading of dysplastic lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of DNA flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining for p53 protein as objective methods to complement the conventional histologic diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common problems and the possible advantages of using these procedures are analyzed briefly in this article </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue from 55 patients diagnosed with BE were processed for flow cytometric measurements (ploidy and proliferation index) and p53 immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both the cytometric data and the positivity of staining for p53 revealed a statistically significant increase throughout the following sequence: no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> --&gt; indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> --&gt; low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> --&gt; high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> --&gt; <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also a highly significant correlation between the results of the cytometric study and the positivity of staining for p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the future, the use of this procedure could play an important role in the evaluation of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Considering that staining for p53 is technically simple, economical, and quick, and the materials required are available to most pathology laboratories, this method appears to be a firm candidate for application as a biomarker in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors have shown that it is possible to obtain adequate results for cytometric analysis with small formalin fixed, paraffin embedded biopsies if a strict protocol for the acceptance of tissue samples and/or histograms is observed </plain></SENT>
