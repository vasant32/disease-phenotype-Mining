<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">Bile salts</z:chebi> increase proliferation in a Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line (SEG-1 cells) by activating ERK and p38 MAPK pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear that these findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells are applicable to non-neoplastic cells of benign BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> on three human cell lines: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous (NES) cells, non-neoplastic Barrett's cells (BAR cells), and SEG-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> exposure activates proproliferative and antiapoptotic pathways to promote increased growth in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NES, BAR, and SEG-1 cells were exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36274">glycochenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (GCDA) at a neutral pH for 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation was measured by Coulter counter cell counts and a 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GCDA-induced MAPK activation was examined by Western blot analysis for phosphorylated ERK and p38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was measured by TdT-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling and annexin V staining after GCDA and UV-B exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NES cells exposed to 5 min of GCDA did not increase cell number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In BAR cells, GCDA exposure <z:mp ids='MP_0000318'>increased cell number</z:mp> by 31%, increased phosphorylated p38 and ERK levels by two- to three-fold, increased BrdU incorporation by 30%, and decreased UV-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by 15-20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in a non-neoplastic Barrett's cell line, GCDA exposure induces proliferation by activation of both ERK and p38 MAPK pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a potential mechanism whereby <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> may facilitate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> of BE </plain></SENT>
