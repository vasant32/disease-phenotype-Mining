<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because local invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> occurs early in the pathogenesis of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, we hypothesized that EMT may be important in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemistry in a well-characterized set of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissues, we showed down-regulation of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and cytokeratin 18) and up-regulation of mesenchymal markers (vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin) with concomitant transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression at the invasive margin compared with the central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A panel of esophageal cell lines was examined for the ability of TGF-beta1 to induce EMT in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TE7 cells were selected as a model because TGF-beta1 (0-5 ng/mL) treatment induced morphologic and molecular expression changes suggestive of EMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In TE7 cells, these TGF-beta1-induced changes were reversed by 100 ng/mL of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7), another member of the TGF-beta1 superfamily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EMT was mediated via canonical TGF-beta1 signaling with concomitant up-regulation of SMAD-interacting protein 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alterations in functional variables (aggregation, wounding, motility, and invasion) following TGF-beta1 treatment were consistent with a more invasive phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These functional changes were reversed by BMP7 and SMAD4 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that TGF-beta1-mediated EMT may be relevant in esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
