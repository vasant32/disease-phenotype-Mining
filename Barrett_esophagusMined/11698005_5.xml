<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present 2 cases received in consultation which demonstrated peculiar artifacts that closely mimicked <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In case 1, contaminating products of conception were confused with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In case 2, artifactual signet ring cells induced by procedural trauma were suspicious for signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both cases, clinical correlation failed to completely exclude <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and limited tissue prevented use of ancillary studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our final resolution of these artifacts required lengthy and detailed morphologic analysis </plain></SENT>
