<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The interpretation of magnification endoscopy regarding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histology of areas endoscopically suspected of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> often reveals only cardia-type mucosa (CTM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize the surface structure of CTM by magnification endoscopy, in comparison with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) and gastric corpus mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnification endoscopy was performed in 52 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EGJ and 36 patients with columnar lined lower esophagus (CLE) on endoscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies for histology were obtained from EGJ and CLE segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cases with CLE, biopsies were targeted after <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A gyriform or oval pattern was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EGJ, histologically representing CTM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patterns of CTM were easily discernible from the small pits of corpus mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A gyriform or villous pattern was dominant in CLE, both in areas with CTM and those with SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">Methylene blue</z:chebi> staining was more frequent in SIM than in CTM, but was of insufficient specificity for SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although magnification endoscopy allows one to differentiate CTM from gastric corpus mucosa, a clear distinction from SIM is not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Auxiliary methods that complement magnification endoscopy, like <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> staining and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> contrast enhancement, should be evaluated regarding the differentiation between CTM and SIM </plain></SENT>
