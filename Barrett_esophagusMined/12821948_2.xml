<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This deleted region, designated minimal region III (MRIII), lies between the two microsatellite markers D17S1852 and D17S954 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computational sequence analysis techniques, BLAST and NIX, were used to assemble a physical map of MRIII, consisting of three overlapping <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, 297N7, 963H4 and 795F17, from the RPCI-11 library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 270 kb genomic sequence of MRIII was analysed using the computational gene prediction methods NIX and TAP to identify putative BOA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A transcript map of MRIII has been generated and contains 25 candidate BOA genes, four of which are the named genes MYH3, SCO1, x006 and MAGOH-LIKE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other candidates consist of seven genes predicted by TAP with associated ESTs identified by NIX, two genes predicted by TAP alone and 12 genes/ESTs (or pairs of ESTs) identified by NIX alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No disease-specific mutations were identified in x006 or MAGOH-LIKE, although expression analysis of these genes suggests that they may show alternative splicing or be altered epigenetically or in regulatory regions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
