<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Magnification endoscopy after contrast enhancement with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> or staining with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> has been reported to be highly accurate in predicting specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, however, no data have been published on the interobserver and intra-observer variability of these new methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with reflux symptoms were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy was carried out with a magnification endoscope, and video sequences were recorded in standard and zoom modes (at the 12-o'clock, 3-o'clock, 6-o'clock, and 9-o'clock positions) before and after instillation of 1.5 % <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> (n = 26) or staining with 0.5 % <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were obtained from the same locations for histopathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 102 video sequences were shown to four experienced endoscopists in a mixed and blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The evaluation criteria used followed the published criteria; classification was carried out according to the pit-pattern structure, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> positivity, and the presence of villous structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, a general statement on suspected SIM in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was requested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With regard to the criteria selected for evaluation, there was a high level of interobserver variability among the four examiners (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kappa &lt; 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SIM was histologically detectable in 60.8 % of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the examiners for predicting SIM by magnification endoscopy was around 50 %, with no differences observed before and after instillation of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The suggested criteria for identifying SIM using magnification endoscopy are associated with a high level of interobserver variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When evaluated in a blinded manner, staining techniques do not significantly improve the yield for detecting SIM at the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
