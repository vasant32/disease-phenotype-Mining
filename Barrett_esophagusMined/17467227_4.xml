<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated whether DNA damage linked to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (as 8-OHdG) is present in Barrett's mucosa with or without associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls' squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We measured 8-OHdG in 51 patients (13 Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 18 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal oesophagus/oesophagogastric junction and 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount of DNA damage was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in oesophagus samples obtained either from endoscopy or as samples from surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median 8-OHdG concentration was expressed as the ratio of 8-OHdG per 10(5) deoxyguanosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis revealed that 8-OHdG was present in both Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> as well as in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus/oesophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the study group was small the amount of 8-OHdG was significantly increased in the distal oesophagus both in Barrett's epithelium 1.26 (0.08-29.47) and in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> 1.35 (1.04-1.65) as well as in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of oesophagus/oesophagogastric junction 1.08 (0.59-1.94) compared to controls 0.06 (0-4.08) (p=0.002, p=0.012, p=0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Barrett's patients had no significant difference in 8-OHdG levels between their distal and proximal oesophageal samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the presence of oxidative DNA damage in the distal oesophagus of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus/oesophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
