<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter usually develops from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> named <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MUC genes are known to be specifically expressed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, premalignant and malignant epithelia of various tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish the pattern of MUC gene expression in the esophageal mucosa under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions, and under pathological conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples of esophageal control mucosa, metaplastic and malignant tissues were obtained from 40 patients undergoing esophagectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (n = 17), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization and northern blot were used with probes specific for the MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC6 and MUC7 genes to assess their expression in these samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Submucosal glands of control esophageal mucosa expressed MUC5B, whereas MUC1 and MUC4 were found in both control epithelium and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MUC4 expression correlated with squamous cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> exhibited various patterns of MUC gene expression, the strongest being in the well-differentiated mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was also associated with a specific MUC gene expression pattern, since the gastric apomucin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, MUC5AC and MUC6, were expressed in <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp>, and the intestinal apomucin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, MUC3, MUC4 and mostly MUC2, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Residual expression of gastric apomucin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> was found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From these results, we conclude that MUC genes can be considered reliable phenotypic markers of the esophageal cell differentiation, thus providing new insight into the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
