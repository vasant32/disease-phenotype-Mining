<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the different gene expression profiles in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) induced by gastro-duodeno-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Esophagoduodenostomy was performed in 8-wk old Sprague-Dawley rats to induce gastro-duodeno-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e>, and a group of rats that received sham operation served as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Esophageal epithelial pathological tissues were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression profiles of 4096 genes in EA and BE tissues were compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus epithelium in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (NC) by cDNA microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-eight genes in BE were more than three times different from those in NC, including 312 upregulated and 136 downregulated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and seventy-seven genes in EA were more than three times different from those in NC, including 255 upregulated and 142 downregulated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to BE, there were 122 upregulated and 156 downregulated genes in EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the interested genes were those involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among them, the upregulated genes included cathepsin C, aminopeptidase M, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> epoxygenase, tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, cyclic <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-stimulated phosphodiesterase, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, betaine-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> methyltransferase, lysozyme, complement 4b binding protein, complement 9 protein, insulin-like growth factor binding protein, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3, aldolase B, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> X receptor gamma, carboxylesterase and testicular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The downregulated genes included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> synthetase, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, p55CDC, heart fatty acid binding protein, cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> regulator and endothelial cell selectin ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Esophageal epithelium exposed excessively to harmful ingredients of duodenal and gastric reflux may develop into BE and even EA gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The gene expression level is different between EA and BE, and may be related to the occurrence and progression of EA </plain></SENT>
