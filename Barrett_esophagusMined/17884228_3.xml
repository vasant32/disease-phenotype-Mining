<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Once being established, this technique will be a potential alternative to today's standard diagnosis, i.e. four-quadrant random biopsies which are taken every 1-2 cm of the esophagus for histopathological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to further improve this methodology, topical application of lipophilic 5-ALA <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> to the esophagus could be advantageous in terms of fluorescence contrast and fluorescence intensity in the target tissue, adverse side effects, as well as application time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a bioadhesive formulation loaded with hexylaminolevulinate (HAL) targeting the esophageal lining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, different mucoadhesive gels including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">poloxamer</z:chebi> 407, cross-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51133">polyacrylic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30618">hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> carboxymethylcellulose and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> have been evaluated with respect to bioadhesion to the esophagus using an ex vivo rat model and a clinical study on healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to visualize the mucoadhesive properties of the formulations, a blue dye was incorporated as contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">Chitosan</z:chebi> has shown the best esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using the in vitro release profiles from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> loaded with 40 mM of HAL, one can estimate that after a residence time of 10 min on the esophageal wall, the amount of HAL delivered to the epithelium will be sufficient to perform fluorescence diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> following swallowing of this formulation </plain></SENT>
