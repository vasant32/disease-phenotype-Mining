<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has become a recognized tool in the treatment of dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but its use in gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> has not yet been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to describe three cases of RFA treatment in patients with persistent dysplastic gastric mucosa confirmed by consensus of two expert gastrointestinal pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each patient, two catheter-based RFA procedures were performed 8 weeks apart in an outpatient setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although each patient reported minor epigastric pain after RFA, there were no major complications such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, stricture, or the need for hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic follow-up with extensive biopsy sampling 2, 4, 6, 12, and 18 months after the last RFA revealed negative results for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that RFA may be considered in the treatment of gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The confirmation of these data with a large series can lead to a change in the paradigm of gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> management </plain></SENT>
