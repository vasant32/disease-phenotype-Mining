<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty consecutive patients with HGD who underwent esophagectomy had pre- and postoperative pathology examined at our institution from 1982 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed medical records to determine patient characteristics, surgical approach, operative morbidity and mortality, pathology, and length of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients and/or referring physicians were contacted to determine long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three men (88%) and 7 women (12%) were followed up for a median of 4.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transhiatal esophagectomy was performed in the majority of patients (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was one operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (1.7%) and 15 complications (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median length of stay was 9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 18 patients (30%), invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was detected in the resected specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When examined by time periods, 43% (13/30) of patients were diagnosed with occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> from 1982-1994, whereas 17% (5/30) harbored <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741885" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">occult malignancy</z:e> from 1994-2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the recent interval had stage I disease, as opposed to only 61.5% of patients from the earlier study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality declined from 3.3% to 0% over the two intervals as did mean length of stay from 14 days to 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival was excellent at 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Age and amount of preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> were preoperative predictors of survival, whereas major postoperative complications and stage were postoperative predictors of outcome </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Overall prevalence of occult <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> remains high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated a declining incidence of occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and treatment of earlier stage <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> when found in this population of patients treated with esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
