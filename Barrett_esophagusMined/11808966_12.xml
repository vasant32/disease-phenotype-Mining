<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We correlated follow-up information from 138 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and varying degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A group of pathologist participants were asked to contribute patients' initial biopsy slides showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and with epithelial changes indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the initial 250 cases used for a diagnostic reproducibility study, follow-up information was available for 138 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 44 cases submitted as BE, 22 as BE with epithelial changes indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 26 as BE with LGD, 33 as BE with HGD, and 13 as BE with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>Ulcers</z:mpath> were present in 35/138 cases (25%), including 3/44 cases of BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (7%), 2/22 cases of BE with epithelial changes indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (9%), 0/26 cases of BE with LGD (0%), 10/33 cases of BE with HGD (30%), and 7/13 cases of BE with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On follow-up, there were no invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> detected among the BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> group (median follow-up = 38.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were detected in 4/22 cases (18%) submitted as BE with epithelial changes indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at 19, 55, 60, and 62 months and in 4/26 cases (15%) of BE with LGD at 9, 9, 11, and 60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of these <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> occurred in cases in which an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was present in the initial biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 33 HGD cases, 20 (60%) were found to have <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> on subsequent resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> with HGD increased the likelihood of finding <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the resection specimen, as 8/10 biopsies (80%) of HGD patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, compared to 12/23 biopsies (52%) of HGD patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the cases interpreted as <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> on biopsy were found either to have invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> on esophageal resection or to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> that were demonstrated in unresectable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: If an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> accompanies HGD in a biopsy specimen from a patient with BE, it is likely that invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is also present at that time </plain></SENT>
