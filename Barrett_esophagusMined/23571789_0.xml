<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate clinicopathologic features of patients who underwent esophageal surgery after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment using the HALO system for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated patients from our hospital database who underwent esophagectomy from August 2006 to January 2012 after previously receiving RFA for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information on demographics, time between RFA and surgery, indications for surgery, and final esophageal pathology was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our study, we selected 102 patients who underwent esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients had a history of RFA for BE with HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients were referred because of persistent HGD despite RFA, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients had HGD in the esophagectomy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented with a benign diagnosis (esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_425'>leiomyoma</z:mpath>), and both of these patients had pathologic stage T3N2M0 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus in the resected specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa overlying <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the muscularis propria and adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with stage T3N2M0 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> did not have pre-RFA endoscopic ultrasound, first treatment of RFA with HALO, or surveillance endoscopic biopsy every 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation for BE with HGD may mask underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who are counseled to undergo RFA for HGD should be aware that RFA could lead to delayed diagnosis and delayed treatment of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> without careful patient selection, appropriate RFA use, and close surveillance </plain></SENT>
