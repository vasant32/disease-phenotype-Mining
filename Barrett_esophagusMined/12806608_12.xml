<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of this strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of chemoprevention (compared with endoscopic surveillance or with no surveillance) was analyzed with a computer model of a Markov process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under baseline conditions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (neoplastic and nonneoplastic), the ICER of chemoprevention ranges between $12,700 and $18,500 US dollars per life-year saved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, these cost values are sensitive to variations in the costs of chemoprevention, incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> in reducing the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, which can shift the ICER into a cost range that is prohibitively expensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in those patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the ICER ranges between $3900 and $5000 US dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chemoprevention remains a cost-effective option even under rather unfavorable conditions, such as higher cost and lower efficacy of chemoprevention and lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This model suggests that a high incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> renders chemoprevention cost-effective even in the presence of less-favorable conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, chemoprevention may not be a cost-effective measure in the general population of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, depending on unknown factors such as cost and efficacy of chemoprevention as well as true incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
