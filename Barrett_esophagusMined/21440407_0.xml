<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To achieve that biopsies targeted to areas suspicious of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, a method of high sensitivity is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromoendoscopy has been developed in this direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">Acetic acid</z:chebi> combined with high resolution endoscopy and zooming represents an aid in the preparation of the oesophageal mucosa for visualization of suspicious anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is safe, cheap and easy to use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">Acetic acid</z:chebi> has proven its value in improving the visibility of the pit pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several vital dyes have been tested, including <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi>, indigo carmine and crystal violet, with mixed results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The FICE(®) and NBI(®), immediate, reversible and attractive virtual chromoendoscopy techniques represent interesting tools for improving sensitivity in screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and its complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Confocal endomicroscopy, which is similar as a "per-endoscopic real time histological examination", seems to be equally a promising technique in detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But these tools which are capable of improvement so far, have not proved their use on a large population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For this, the systematic biopsy protocol Seattle remains the "gold standard" in monitoring the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
