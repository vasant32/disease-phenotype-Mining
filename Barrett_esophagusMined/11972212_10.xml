<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has therefore been questioned whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is the primary precursor lesion of such lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the underlying Barrett's mucosa may be masked by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> in the majority of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The pretherapeutic endoscopy and biopsy records of 79 patients with locally advanced esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> who had undergone preoperative chemotherapy were reviewed and compared to findings on restaging endoscopy/biopsy and subsequent resection and histopathologic analysis of the resected specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretherapeutic endoscopy and biopsy showed associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 59/79 patients, whereas there was no evidence of associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in 20/79 patients on extensive biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Barrett's mucosa was unmasked and later documented by biopsy or histopathologic assessment of the resected specimen in 18 of the latter 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This resulted in an overall association of Barrett's mucosa with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the distal esophagus of 97.4% CONCLUSION: Underlying Barrett's mucosa is frequently masked by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> in patients with locally advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
