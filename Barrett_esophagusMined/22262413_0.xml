<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed to examine toenail trace element status and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Toenail clippings from each hallux were obtained from 638 participants of the FINBAR (Factors Influencing the Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> Relationship) study comprising 221 healthy controls, 98 reflux <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, 182 BO and 137 OAC cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of eight toenail trace elements were determined using instrumental neutron activation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using multivariable adjusted logistic regression analysis, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated within tertiles of trace element concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A twofold increased risk of BO was observed, but not OAC, among individuals in the highest tertile of toenail zinc status OR 2.21 (95% CI, 1.11-4.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A higher toenail <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> status was not associated with risk of OAC OR 0.94 (95% CI, 0.44-2.04) or BO OR 0.89 (95% CI, 0.37-2.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A borderline significant increased risk of BO was detected with a higher toenail <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> concentration, OR 1.97 (95% CI, 1.01-3.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association was found between toenail levels of <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33369">cerium</z:chebi>, mercury and OAC or BO risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first case-control study to investigate a variety of trace elements in relation to OAC and BO risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and proapoptotic properties, no associations were found with <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
