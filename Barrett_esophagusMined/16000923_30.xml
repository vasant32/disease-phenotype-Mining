<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Endoscopy is commonly performed to evaluate for suspected or established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal diseases</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) and its complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The newly developed PillCam ESO Esophageal Capsule offers an alternative approach to visualize the esophagus and to evaluate patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: Compare the accuracy (specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>], and negative predictive value [NPV]) of esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE) compared with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in evaluating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicenter pivotal trial was conducted at seven sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PillCam ESO esophageal capsule is similar to the standard capsule endoscope used for the small bowel but acquires video images from both ends of the device at 2 frames/second/end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 106 patients (93 GERD; 13 Barrett) underwent ECE followed by EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECE videos were evaluated by an investigator blinded to EGD findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A blinded adjudication committee reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> discrepant findings between ECE and EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six of 106 patients had positive esophageal findings, ECE identified esophageal abnormalities in 61 (sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The per-protocol sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, and NPV of ECE for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> were 97%, 99%, 97%, and 99%, respectively, and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> 89%, 99%, 97%, and 94%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ECE was preferred over EGD by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no adverse events related to ECE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ECE is a convenient and sensitive method for visualization of esophageal mucosal pathology and may provide an effective method to evaluate patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
