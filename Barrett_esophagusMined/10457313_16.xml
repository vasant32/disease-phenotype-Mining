<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate anatomic and physiologic alterations of the cardia and esophageal exposure to gastric and duodenal juice in patients with short and long segments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these patients were compared to each other and to patients with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and those with no mucosal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred sixty-two consecutive patients with foregut symptoms were divided into the following four groups based on endoscopic and histologic findings: group 1, no mucosal injury; group 2, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>; group 3, short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; and group 4, long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal exposure time to acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, lower esophageal sphincter characteristics, and endoscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the cardia were compared between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had elevated esophageal acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> exposure, decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure and length, and a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities were similar to those in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and in general less profound than those found in patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The length of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was higher in patients with a defective lower esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a complication of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and is associated with the reflux of both gastric and duodenal juice similar to that seen in patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
