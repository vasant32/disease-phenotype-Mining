<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to these changes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7915">pantoprazole</z:chebi> was the only preferred <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>, and there were no restrictions to its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The revised formulary included 3 preferred <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> OTC), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which required prior authorization (PA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to obtain an approved PA for a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>, the patient was required to have either (a) a diagnosis of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267081" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Schatzki's ring</z:e>, a pathological hypersecretory condition (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0002044'>Zollinger-Ellison syndrome</z:hpo>, multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_369'>endocrine adenoma</z:mpath>), grade III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastropathy</z:e>, significant gastrointestinal bleed; or (b) another indication for acid suppression therapy (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, hyperacidity in cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, gastric or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002578'>gastroparesis</z:hpo>) with a history of failure of prior therapy with a <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>-2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (H2-blocker) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The internal medicine clinic of a regional medical center implemented an intervention to address these changes in formulary status of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To (a) describe the process used by an internal medicine clinic to ensure that patients requiring acid suppression therapy received appropriate treatment according to revised TennCare formulary criteria without unnecessary interruption of therapy, and (b) assess self-reported symptom control 8 months after intervention in the patients who either discontinued therapy or stepped-down to H2-blocker therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study involved TennCare patients in an internal medicine clinic who received a new or refill prescription for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7915">pantoprazole</z:chebi> between April 20 and June 20, 2005, from the medical center's outpatient pharmacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A clinical pharmacist and an internal medicine physician collaborated to develop a protocol for adjusting acid suppression therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A clinical pharmacist reviewed medical records for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients identified to verify indications for acid suppression therapy and review medication history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient telephone interviews were also conducted for patients whose indication or medication history could not be determined by chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who met TennCare criteria for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy were continued on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy after a PA was obtained (PA group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who had a documented indication for acid suppression therapy but did not meet the PA criteria for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy were changed to H2-blocker therapy (step-down group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients without a documented indication for acid suppression therapy were discontinued from acid suppression therapy (discontinue therapy group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A follow-up chart review and patient telephone interview were conducted 8 months after the intervention for patients in the step-down and discontinue therapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this follow-up review was to determine (a) the proportion of patients who were taking acid suppression therapy, (b) the type of acid suppression therapy (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> or H2-blocker), and (c) self-report of adequate control of symptoms (defined as symptoms once weekly or less) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 135 TennCare beneficiaries who were active patients of the internal medicine clinic and received a prescription from the outpatient pharmacy for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7915">pantoprazole</z:chebi>) between April 20 and June 20, 2005, 6 patients were excluded because they reported stopping <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy on their own </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 129 patients, 18 (14.0%) did not have an indication for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy and acid suppression therapy was discontinued (discontinue therapy group), 40 (31.0%) met the TennCare PA criteria for continuation of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy (PA group), and 71 (55.0%) did not meet the TennCare PA criteria and were stepped down to a H2-blocker (step-down group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>At the 8-month follow-up, acid suppression therapy was assessed in 68 patients (21 patients were lost to follow-up): 13 patients (19.1%) had resumed <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy; 38 (55.9%) were using an H2-blocker; and 17 (25.0%) were not using acid suppression therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Telephone interviews were completed for 45 of the 75 patients in the step-down and discontinue therapy groups who did not receive an escalation in acid suppression therapy after the initial intervention (i.e., who did not make a change from H2-blocker therapy to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy or from no acid suppression therapy to H2-blocker or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (62.2%) reported symptoms once per week or less; 14 patients (31.1%) reported symptoms more often than once weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Symptom control was unable to be determined in 3 patients (6.7%) because of incomplete information obtained from the patient during the interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After a proactive collaboration between physicians and clinical pharmacists in response to changes in TennCare formulary criteria for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>, more than one-half of patients were stepped down to H2-blocker therapy, and 14% were discontinued from acid suppression therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Among the step-down or therapy discontinuation patients for whom data were available at the 8-month follow-up, 81% were still using either an H2-blocker or no acid suppressing therapy at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, and 19% had resumed <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
