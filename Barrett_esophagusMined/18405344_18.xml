<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Human gastrointestinal mucosa regenerates vigorously throughout life, but the factors controlling cell fate in mature mucosa are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GATA transcription factors direct cell proliferation and differentiation in many organs, and are implicated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GATA-4 and GATA-6 are considered crucial for the formation of murine gastrointestinal mucosa, but their role in human gastrointestinal tract remains unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied in detail the expression patterns of these two GATA factors and a GATA-6 down-stream target, Indian hedgehog (Ihh), in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human gastrointestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since these factors are considered important for proliferation and differentiation, we also explored the possible alterations in their expression in gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>-related protein Indian hedgehog was also investigated in comparison to GATA factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic gastrointestinal tract from children and adults were subjected to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in situ hybridization with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37973">33P</z:chebi> labelled probes and immunohistochemistry, using an avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> immunoperoxidase system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathological tissues examined included samples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GATA-4 was abundant in the differentiated epithelial cells of the proximal parts of the gastrointestinal tract but was absent from the distal parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, GATA-6 was expressed throughout the gastrointestinal epithelium, and in the distal gut its expression was most intense at the bottom of the crypts, i.e. cells with proliferative capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both factors were also present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GATA-6 expression was reduced in colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ihh expression overlapped with that of GATA-6 especially in benign gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest differential but overlapping functions for GATA-4 and GATA-6 in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastrointestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GATA-4, GATA-6 and Ihh expression is altered in premalignant dysplastic lesions and reduced in overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
