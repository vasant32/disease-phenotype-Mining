<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of endoscopic erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EE) and associated risk factors after transplantation are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether there was a high incidence of endoscopic findings of EE in solid organ transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective case-control study included 256 of 3,152 solid organ transplant recipients who underwent sequential screening upper endoscopic examinations and an equal number of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four (17.2%) and 16 (6.2%) cases of EE were detected in the solid organ transplant and control groups, respectively (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, transplantation was significantly associated with EE (odds ratio [OR], 6.48; 95% confidence interval, 2.74 to 15.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factors such as old age (OR, 1.17), the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (OR, 5.84), an increased duration of immunosuppression (OR, 1.07), and the maintenance administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil (OR, 4.13) were independently associated with the occurrence of EE in the solid organ transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in the incidence of endoscopically detected EE was observed in solid organ transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This increased incidence was associated with the type and duration of the immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
