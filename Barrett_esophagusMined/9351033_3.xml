<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Brush cytology and histology have been found to be complementary in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at a referral medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the usefulness of brush cytology and histology in a community hospital setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent esophagogastroscopy performed by four staff gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four quadrant biopsy specimens for histopathology at 3-cm intervals throughout the Barrett's segment and one brushing for cytology were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> specimens were interpreted by four board-certified staff pathologists in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histologic diagnosis included three <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, one high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, six low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath>, and one indeterminate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytology diagnosed the same three <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, no high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, three low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and two indeterminate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The case of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on histology was diagnosed as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The six patients found to have low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by histology were found to have low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (3), indeterminate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (2), and no abnormality (1) by cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In no case was a higher grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> diagnosed by cytology than by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adding brush cytology to histology increased the cost but not the diagnostic yield in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in a community hospital setting </plain></SENT>
