<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, two different methods were used to investigate the prevalence of columnar-lined (Barrett's) esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, a population-based study of clinically diagnosed cases was performed in Olmsted County, Minnesota </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five residents of this county, who had undergone endoscopy and biopsy between 1969 and 1986, were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On January 1, 1987, 17 of these patients were still living in the county, representing an age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rate of 22.6 cases per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval, 11.7-33.6 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A prospective search of Mayo Clinic autopsy material for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was conducted using the same diagnostic criteria as in the clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over an 18-month period ending in September 1987, 7 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were found in 733 unselected autopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 5 of the 7 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was first detected at the time of autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the age- and sex-specific prevalence from the clinically diagnosed study, researchers expected to find 0.19 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at the 226 autopsies performed on Olmsted County residents, although 4 were actually observed (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This approximately 21-fold increase (95% confidence interval, 5-54 cases) corresponds to an autopsy estimated prevalence of 376 cases per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval, 95-967 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a majority of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, a condition that predisposes to esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, remains unrecognized in the general population </plain></SENT>
