<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its potential to develop <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> may require a surveillance program with better diagnostic tools to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GOALS: To investigate the role of imprint cytology as a diagnostic tool either alone or combined with histology in SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY: Seventy-nine patients (46 men, 33 women) with SSBE diagnosed during elective upper gastroscopy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with serrated z-line with short tongues of pink mucosa and patients with a circular non-serrated z-line that extended less than 2 cm above the esophagogastric junction were biopsied on four quadrants just distal to z-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four slides of imprint preparation (including 1, 2, 3, and 4 touching of each biopsy specimen) was made for cytologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and Alcian blue staining for histologic examinations and Alcian Blue for cytologic evaluations were used to find evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was detected in 15 (19%), 21 (27%), and 30 (38%) patients by histologic examination with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin alone, by Alcian blue alone, and by histologic plus cytologic examination with Alcian blue, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with negative histologic but positive cytologic results were positive for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> when they were reevaluated after further sectioning and staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of imprint cytology alone was 53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When imprint cytology was combined with the histologic evaluation, the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> increased from 27% to 38% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Imprint cytology might be a complementary diagnostic tool for histology in detecting patients with SSBE </plain></SENT>
