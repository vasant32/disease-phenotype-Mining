<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship of insulin, IGF-1 and IGF binding proteins (IGFBP) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) has not been well examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum levels of insulin and IGFBPs in patients with BO were compared with two separate control groups: subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (GORD) and screening colonoscopy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting insulin, IGF-1 and IGFBPs were assayed in the serum of BO cases (n = 135), GORD (n = 135) and screening colonoscopy (n = 932) controls recruited prospectively at two academic hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the highest tertile of serum insulin levels had an increased risk of BO compared with colonoscopy controls (adjusted OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.54) but not compared with GORD controls (adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum IGF-1 levels in the highest tertile were associated with an increased risk of BO (adjusted OR 4.05, 95% CI 2.01 to 8.17) compared with the screening colonoscopy control group but were not significantly different from the GORD control group (adjusted OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IGFBP-1 levels in the highest tertile were inversely associated with a risk of BO in comparison with the screening colonoscopy controls (adjusted OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.24) but were not significantly different from the GORD control group (adjusted OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IGFBP-3 levels in the highest tertile were inversely associated with the risk of BO compared with the GORD controls (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.81) and also when compared with the colonoscopy controls (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the hypothesis that the insulin/IGF signalling pathways have a role in the development of BO </plain></SENT>
