<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the results of this technique in patients with complicated (n = 21) and noncomplicated (n=45) BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete evaluation of esophageal function, endoscopic histologic and clinical control was carried out before and 2 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-operative results show recurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in patients with complicated BE, but no recurrence in patients with non-complicated BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcer</z:mp> and stricture were present in 85.3% and 14.3%, respectively, of patients with complicated BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this group, recurrence of these complications was 38.1% and 9.5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technique offers excellent results in patients with non-complicated BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with complicated BE, the recurrence rate is higher, mainly because of the persistence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> into the esophagus </plain></SENT>
