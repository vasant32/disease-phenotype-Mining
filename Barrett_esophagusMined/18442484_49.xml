<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed whether narrow band targeted biopsies could detect advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> using fewer biopsy samples compared with standard resolution endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a prospective, blinded, tandem endoscopy study in a tertiary care center with 65 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> undergoing evaluation for previously detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard resolution endoscopy was used first to detect visible lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Narrow band endoscopy was then used by another gastroenterologist to detect and biopsy areas suspicious for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesions initially detected by standard resolution endoscopy were then disclosed and biopsied, after biopsy of the lesions targeted with NBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, random 4-quadrant biopsies were taken throughout the segment of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher grades of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were found by NBI in 12 patients (18%), compared with no cases (0%) in whom standard resolution white light endoscopy with random biopsy detected a higher grade of histology (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, narrow band directed biopsies detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in more patients (n = 37; 57%) compared with biopsies taken using standard resolution endoscopy (n = 28; 43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, more biopsies were taken using standard resolution endoscopy with random biopsy compared with narrow band targeted biopsies (mean 8.5 versus 4.7; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, NBI detected significantly more patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and higher grades of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with fewer biopsy samples compared with standard resolution endoscopy </plain></SENT>
