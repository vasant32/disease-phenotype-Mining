<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is highly prevalent in lung transplantation, the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in these patients is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> after lung transplantation differs from that of a control population, and that the 30-d morbidity and mortality of laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) are equivalent in both populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively compared the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and the 30-d morbidity and mortality of 29 consecutive lung transplant patients with 23 consecutive patients without lung transplantation (control group), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had LARS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> between November 2008 and May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups had a similar prevalence of endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> , comparable manometric profiles, and similar prevalence of abnormal peristalsis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was more common in controls than in lung transplant patients (57% versus 24%; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lung transplant patients had a higher prevalence and severity of proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (65% versus 33%; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 30-d morbidity and mortality following LARS were similar in both groups regardless of the higher surgical risk of lung transplants (median <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class: 3 versus 2 for controls, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that despite similar manometric profiles, lung transplant patients are more prone to proximal reflux than the general population with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>; the prevalence of endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is the same in both groups of patients; a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> is uncommon after lung transplantation; and the morbidity and mortality of LARS are the same for lung transplant patients as the general population with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
