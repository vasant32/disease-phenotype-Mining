<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 213 mapped, flow-purified, endoscopic biopsies to determine the distribution of p53-mutant clones in the Barrett's segments of 58 patients who had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients (50%) had p53 mutations in their Barrett's segments, including 3 patients with multiple distinct p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p53-mutant clones, including diploid cell populations, underwent expansion from 1 to 9 cm in the Barrett's segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 12 of 29 patients (41%) with a p53 mutation, the same mutation was found at every evaluated level of the metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This extensive p53-mutant clonal expansion suggests a somatic genetic basis for previous observations of field effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
