<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the CDH13 gene has been shown to undergo epigenetic silencing by promoter methylation in many types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, hypermethylation of this gene in Barrett's-associated esophageal adenocarcinogenesis has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred fifty-nine human esophageal tissues were therefore examined for CDH13 promoter hypermethylation by real-time methylation-specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CDH13 hypermethylation showed discriminative receiver-operator characteristic curve profiles, sharply demarcating esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) from esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (NE) (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CDH13 normalized methylation values (NMV) were significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), dysplastic BE (D) and EAC than in NE (p &lt; 0.0000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CDH13 hypermethylation frequency was 0% in NE but increased early during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>, rising to 70% in BE, 77.5% in D and 76.1% in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both CDH13 hypermethylation frequency and its mean NMV were significantly higher in BE with than without accompanying EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 5 (19.2%) of 26 ESCCs exhibited CDH13 hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both CDH13 hypermethylation frequency and its mean NMV were significantly higher in EAC than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>, as well as in BE or D vs. <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, mean CDH13 NMV was significantly lower in short-segment than in long-segment BE, a known clinical risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, BE segment length was significantly lower in specimens with unmethylated than with methylated CDH13 promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> treatment of OE33 EAC and KYSE220 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> cells reduced CDH13 methylation and increased CDH13 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that hypermethylation of CDH13 is a common, tissue-specific event in human EAC, occurs early during BE-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>, and correlates with known clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
