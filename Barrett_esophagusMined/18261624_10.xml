<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying the transformation from metaplastic to dysplastic to adenocarcinomatous epithelium are still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As loss of transforming growth factor-beta growth inhibition is considered a hallmark of several human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, we evaluated the expression of Ski and SnoN (proteins that antagonize transforming growth factor-beta signaling through physical interaction with Smad complex and by recruiting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylases), as markers of the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway, in BE with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples from 37 patients (26 men, aged 60 +/- 8 years) with histologically proven BE were evaluated; 10 patients had concomitant low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 7 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and 6 HGD associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ski and SnoN expression was assessed immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither Ski nor SnoN was expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium, but both were strongly expressed in BE tissue, with intense cytoplasmic positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of these proteins decreased markedly in dysplastic areas in patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and was absent in those with HGD or HGD/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ski and SnoN proteins are overexpressed in BE and may be involved in abnormal signaling elicited by transforming growth factor-beta in this epithelium, enhancing the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations might help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the BE <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> process </plain></SENT>
