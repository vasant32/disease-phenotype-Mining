<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The term <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> refers to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> that is characterized by the replacement of the esophageal squamous mucosa by a columnar-lined one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary studies have demonstrated reversal of Barrett's mucosa after endoscopic coagulation with different techniques associated with acid inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, most of these studies have shown that residual Barrett's glands are found underneath the new squamous epithelium in up to 40% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of our study is to verify whether complete restoration of Barrett's mucosa can be achieved by the combination of high power setting <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 33 patients (mean age: 55.2 yr, range: 21-84 yr; 21 men and 12 women) with histologically demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (mean length: 4.05 cm, range: 0.5-7 cm) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cases presented with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and one with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the extent, or until a maximum of 4 cm, of the Barrett's mucosa was cauterized in each session using <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> beam coagulation at a power setting of 65-70 W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received 60 mg <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete restoration of squamous mucosa was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 33 cases after a mean of 1.96 sessions (range, 1-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic results were histologically confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (57.5%) patients experienced moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and odyno-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> lasting for 3-10 days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five of these cases experienced high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and a small volume of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo>, and three patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> that needed to be dilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Another patient developed pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> without evidences of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 10.6 months there was one endoscopic, as well as histological, recurrence of Barrett's mucosa in a patient with an ineffective laparoscopic fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High power setting <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation combined with intensive acid suppression is an effective treatment for the total endoscopic ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, at least in the short term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up of treated patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> is surgically or medically alleviated seems mandatory before drawing definitive conclusions about this therapy </plain></SENT>
