<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the dose-response, safety, and efficacy of circumferential endoscopic ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) by using an endoscopic balloon-based ablation device (HALO360 System) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This study was conducted in 2 serial phases (dosimetry phase and effectiveness phase) to evaluate a balloon-based ablation device that delivers a pre-set amount of energy density (J/cm2) to BE tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dosimetry phase evaluated the dose-response and the safety of delivering 6 to 12 J/cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness phase used 10 J/cm2 (delivered twice [x2]) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, followed by EGD with biopsies at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second ablation procedure was performed if BE was present at 1 or 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg twice a day for 1 month after ablation, and 40 mg every day thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postablation symptoms were quantified by using a 14-day symptom diary (scale, 0-100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A complete response (CR) was defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy specimens negative for BE at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Eight U.S. centers, between September 2003 and September 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients were 18 to 75 years of age, with a diagnosis of BE (without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>), with histopathology reconfirmation of the diagnosis within 6 months of enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the dosimetry phase, 32 patients (29 men; mean age, 56.8 years) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median symptom scores returned to a score of 0 of 100 by day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no dose-related serious adverse events, and the outcomes at 1 and 3 months permitted the selection of 10 J/cm2 (x2) for the subsequent effectiveness phase of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the effectiveness phase, 70 patients (52 men, 18 women; mean age, 55.7 years) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median symptom scores returned to a score of 0 of 100 by day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At 12 months (n = 69; mean, 1.5 sessions), a CR for BE was achieved in 70% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There were no strictures and no buried glandular mucosa in either study phase (4306 biopsy fragments evaluated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Circumferential ablation of nondysplastic BE by using this balloon-based ablation device can be performed with no subsequent strictures or buried glands and with complete elimination of BE in 70% of patients at 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
