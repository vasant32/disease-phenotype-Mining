<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Prague C &amp; M criteria, developed for the endoscopic grading of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), (C = circumferential length, M = maximal length) were previously validated among a panel of 29 expert endoscopists with a special interest in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its performance among gastroenterology trainees is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test interobserver agreement among gastroenterology trainees for the Prague C &amp; M criteria, identification of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and the diaphragmatic hiatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Two tertiary referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Standardized endoscopic videos were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen high-quality videos (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, short and long lengths of BE, equally distributed) were independently evaluated by 18 gastroenterology trainees (year 1, n = 5; year 2, n = 6; year 3, n = 7) after administration of a formal teaching module by an expert endoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall intraclass correlation coefficients for assessment of the C and M extent of the endoscopic BE segment above the GEJ were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.89-0.98) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.98), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall intraclass correlation coefficients for GEJ and diaphragmatic hiatus location recognition were 0.92 (0.86-0.96) and 0.90 (0.82-0.95), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The year of training did not affect interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The use of videos for endoscopic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After standardized teaching, the Prague C &amp; M criteria have high overall validity among gastroenterology trainees irrespective of the level of training for endoscopic evaluation of visualized BE lengths as well as key endoscopic landmarks </plain></SENT>
