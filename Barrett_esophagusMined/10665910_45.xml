<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HER-2/neu protein overexpression has been associated with poor prognosis in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, but its significance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BEAd) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and prognostic value of HER-2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 63 cases of BEAd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Routinely processed tissue sections from resection specimens of 63 patients with BEAd (M/F ratio, 10:1; mean age, 63 years) were assayed for HER-2/neu gene amplification by FISH using the Ventana unique sequence probe (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc, Tuscon, AZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH results were correlated with the pathological features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and with patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up data were available for 54 patients (mean follow-up, 31 months [range, 1 to 152 months]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HER-2/ neu gene was amplified in 12 of 63 (19%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of HER-2/neu gene amplification showed a trend toward a correlation with depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion (P = .07), lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P = .13), and pathological stage (P = .14), but did not correlate with any of the other pathological features, such as degree of differentiation or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On both univariate and multivariate analysis, HER-2/neu gene amplification was associated with shortened survival (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HER-2/neu oncogene amplification, as determined by FISH, correlates with shortened patient survival and independently predicts poor outcome in patients with BEAd </plain></SENT>
