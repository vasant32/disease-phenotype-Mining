<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A secondary goal was to evaluate whether gastroenterologists recommend a "once in a lifetime" endoscopy for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A structured questionnaire regarding screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was sent to members of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 51% (203 of 396) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 203 respondents, 165 (81%) performed endoscopies in adults and form the basis of this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of Canadian gastroenterologists followed published guidelines, with 62% screening patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> every two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were screened more frequently, with 54% of respondents performing endoscopy every six months, and 35% on a yearly basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopsy protocols showed the greatest variation, with 46% of gastroenterologists taking four-quadrant biopsies at 2 cm intervals along the columnar-lined (Barrett's) esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six per cent of gastroenterologists agreed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> should have a "once in a lifetime" endoscopy to screen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of Canadian gastroenterologists follow current guidelines for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and support the concept of "once in a lifetime" endoscopy </plain></SENT>
