<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of oxidative DNA damage, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) concentration as <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> parameters and DNA repair capacity, GSTM1, SOD1 Ala16Val and OGG1 Ser326Cys genetic polymorphisms as individual susceptibility parameters in the etiology of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study groups comprised BE patients who were clinically diagnosed (n = 40) and a healthy control group (n = 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basal DNA damage, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> base damage after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> induction, H( 2)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> sensitivity, DNA repair capacity, oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> base damage repair were evaluated in peripheral blood lymphocytes with a modified comet assay using specific endonucleases (Endo III and Fpg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)-based assays were used for genotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient group showed elevated levels of basal DNA damage, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> base damage and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> sensitivity as compared to controls (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA repair capacity, oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> base damage repair capacity, were not statistically different between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GSH concentration was found to be significantly lower in smoking patients than in the controls (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the genetic variations changed the risk of having BE disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, patients carrying the variant OGG1 Cys allele showed elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> base damage as compared to patients carrying the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> OGG1 Ser (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study point to a role of oxidative DNA damage in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, DNA repair capacity, GSTM1, SOD1 Ala16Val and OGG1 Ser326Cys genetic polymorphisms appeared to play no role in the individual susceptibility to this disease </plain></SENT>
