<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are conflicting results concerning the bariatric effectiveness of adjustable gastric banding in super-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) more or equal to 50 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A cohort of 186 patients with a BMI greater or equal to 50 kg/m(2) who underwent adjustable gastric banding (AGB) at the Bichat-Claude-Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) were prospectively entered into a database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following data were recorded: BMI, percentage of BMI loss, percentage of excess weight lost (%EWL), complications, and surgical re-interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Loss of greater than 50% of excess weight was considered a success (primary endpoint) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A %EWL of less than 25% after one year, or the removal of the gastric band was considered a failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five men (18.8%) and 151 women (81.2%), with a mean age of 38.9 years (range: 16-65) underwent AGB between September 1995 and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean BMI was 55.06 kg/m(2) (range: 50-74.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 112.5 months with a minimum of 28 months and a maximum of 172 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The follow-up rate was maintained at 89% at ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The technique of AGB was by "peri-gastric dissection" in the first 115 patients (61.82%) and by "pars flaccida dissection" in 71 patients (38.17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The gastric band was removed in 87 of 186 patients (46.8%); band ablation was due to a complication of the gastric band in 62 of these cases (33.3%), to failure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in 23 cases (12.4%), and to patient request in two cases (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The major complications requiring re-operation were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the proximal gastric pouch (27 patients - 14.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (21 patients - 11.3%), intragastric migration of the prosthesis (six patients - 3.2%), reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (six patients - 3.2%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the gastric band (one patient - 0.5%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (one patient - 0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found between the two operative techniques with regard to the possibility of preserving the gastric band for ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For patients who underwent band removal, no further follow-up analysis of patient data after band ablation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results were best at two years after AGB with a median BMI of 42.72 kg/m(2), a band removal rate of 8.6% (16 of 186 patients), and a failure rate of 16.4% (28 of 170 patients) of those patients who still had their band in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, at 10 years, the picture was completely reversed with a band removal rate of 52.2% (47 of 90 patients), a failure rate of 22% (seven of 33 patients) of those who still had their band in place, and a median BMI of 43.43 kg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic gastroplasty using the adjustable gastric band appeared to be a promising intervention for super-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients when the results at two years were analyzed - fairly simple to perform, with perioperative morbidity and mortality near zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, these results do not persist in the long-term for super-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>At ten years, only 11% of patients (nine of 80) have successful bariatric results (%EWL&gt;50%) and we were forced to remove the gastric band in 52.2% of patients (47 of 90) because of complications, regardless of the initial operative technique used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Given these results, AGB gastroplasty is not a recommended method for super-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients and we believe that a BMI greater or equal to 50 kg/m(2) is a contra-indication for this procedure </plain></SENT>
