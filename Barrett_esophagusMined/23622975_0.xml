<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the esophageal circumferential location of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective study, single tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: One hundred nineteen patients were referred for endoscopic eradication therapy for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic images and reports and pathology were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Circumferential location designation of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in BE by using a clock-face orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred nineteen of 131 patients referred for endoscopic eradication therapy had a location designation for their advanced histology (91.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were a total of 57 patients (47.9%) with HGD and 62 patients (52.1%) with ImCa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly higher rate of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (HGD or ImCa) in the right hemisphere (12 to 6 o'clock location) compared with the left hemisphere (84.9% vs 15.1%, PÂ &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest percentage of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was found in the 12 to 3 o'clock quadrant (64.7%); 71.9% of HGD and 58.1% of ImCa lesions were located in the 12 to 3 o'clock quadrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design, single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> associated with BE is far more commonly found in the right hemisphere of the esophagus (12 to 6 o'clock) with the highest rate in the 12 to 3 o'clock quadrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings support enhanced scrutiny of the right hemisphere of the esophagus during surveillance and endoscopic treatment of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
