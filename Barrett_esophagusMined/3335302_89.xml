<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is uncertainty regarding the value of endoscopic biopsy surveillance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> because, in retrospective studies, some patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in endoscopic biopsy specimens have had unexpected advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> discovered at the time of esophageal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the accuracy of preoperative endoscopic biopsy diagnoses with the final <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathologic diagnoses</z:e> in esophagectomy specimens in 4 patients who had both high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and 4 other patients who had only high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histologic lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 patients were documented in intact mucosa with no gross evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> by endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The preoperative diagnoses were defined with an endoscopic biopsy protocol in which specimens were taken with large-channel biopsy forceps at least every 2 cm throughout the length of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathologic diagnoses</z:e> derived from detailed analysis of the resected specimens confirmed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> without <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 4 patients and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 2 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> had focal submucosal invasion by <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the resected specimens, but no involvement of the muscularis propria or adventitial lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because the natural history of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is not known, the decision to operate on patients with this lesion must be carefully weighed and individualized for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of our patients who underwent esophageal resection for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> died, one immediately postoperatively and the other 9 mo later after a postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Once intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is documented, surgery should be considered if the patient is an acceptable operative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that systematic preoperative endoscopic biopsy of intact mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> can correctly detect high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, either alone or in combination with early, treatable <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
