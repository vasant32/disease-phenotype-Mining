<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a disease with a rising prevalence in western countries probably due to the unhealthy lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In significant number of cases it develops to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two decades ago, important gene regulators (microRNAs) were discovered and their attendance in the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> was demonstrated (e.g. miR-192, 196a, 203) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to select the patients with the increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> before the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> develops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 71 patients with BE disease were selected, slides from FFPE blocks were prepared, the lesions were microdissected and a qPCR relative expression analysis for selected microRNAs (generally known to be connected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> process) was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrated unequivocal statistically significant upregulation of two microRNAs (miR-192, 196a) and downregulation of miR-203 and positive miR-196a correlation with progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that there do exist changes of selected microRNAs which can undoubtedly distinguish the patients with BE from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
