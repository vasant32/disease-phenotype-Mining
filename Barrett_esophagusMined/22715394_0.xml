<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> concentrations, selenoenzyme activity, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and genetic variation in selenoenzymes were associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) and two intermediate endpoints, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and tetraploidy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Development to EA was assessed histologically and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and tetraploidy by DNA content flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> concentrations were measured using atomic absorption spectrometry, activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPX) 1 and GPX3 by substrate-specific coupled test procedures, selenoprotein P (SEPP1) concentrations and protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> content by ELISA method and malondialdehyde concentrations by HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants in GPX1-4 and SEPP1 were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> was not associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> to EA, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> or tetraploidy (P for trend = 0.25 to 0.85) </plain></SENT>
