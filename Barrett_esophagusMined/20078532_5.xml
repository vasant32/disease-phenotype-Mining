<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic surveillance of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is undertaken to detect early stage oesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of a surveillance programme on endoscopy resources and disease detection is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 2004, we commenced a structured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> surveillance programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surveillance protocol specifies surveillance interval and number of oesophageal biopsies required according to previous endoscopy and biopsy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first 3 years of surveillance were reviewed to assess programme adherence, impact on endoscopy resources and the incidence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients undergoing surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred five patients were enrolled in the surveillance programme, and 776 patient years of endoscopy follow-up were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four-quadrant biopsies every 2 cm throughout the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were performed in 89.8% of endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 93.7% of patients had surveillance endoscopy performed at the appropriate time interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Formalizing surveillance was followed by a decrease in the mean time interval for endoscopy surveillance from 16 months to 15 months, although the mode endoscopy surveillance interval lengthened from 1 year to 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean number of biopsies per endoscopy increased from 5.9 to 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In four patients, T1 stage oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was identified, and in six patients, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was identified (combined incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>/high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> 1 per 77.6 endoscopy years of follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Structured Barrett's surveillance detects malignant progression at an early stage, which provides opportunities for curative surgical or endoscopic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Formalizing surveillance resulted in a high rate of adherence to agreed guidelines and rationalized the use of endoscopy resources without significantly increasing workload </plain></SENT>
