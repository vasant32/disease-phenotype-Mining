<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six patients (74%) presented with complications of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 20 strictures, 7 giant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, 11 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 29 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with benign disease, 93% had mechanically defective sphincters and 83% had peristaltic failure of the lower esophageal body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal pH monitoring showed excessive esophageal exposure to pH less than 4 in 93% and excessive exposure to pH more than 7 in 34% of the patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three per cent of patients with excessive alkaline exposure had complications, compared to only 44% with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alkaline exposure (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gastric pH monitoring, serum gastrin levels, and gastric acid analysis supported a duodenal source for the alkaline exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antireflux surgery was performed using Nissen fundoplication in 30, Belsey partial fundoplication in 3, and Collis-Belsey gastroplasty in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six required resection with colon interposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Good symptomatic control was achieved in 77% after antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients had symptoms and signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e>; three required a bile diversion procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had an en bloc curative resection with colon interposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy was found to have intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> after simple esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were intramucosal, seven were intramural, and four were transmural </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Lymph node involvement occurred only in the latter two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival 5 years after curative resection was 53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Median survival time for patients after palliative resection or no resection was 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Study of en bloc specimens indicated that extent of resection should be adapted to extent of disease: esophagectomy for intramucosal disease, en bloc esophagectomy with splenic preservation for intramural and transmural disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Serum CEA was useful in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> after surgery when the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> stained positively for CEA </plain></SENT>
