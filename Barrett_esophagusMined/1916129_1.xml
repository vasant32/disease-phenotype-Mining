<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of infradiaphragmatic Collis' gastroplasty for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> associated with acquired short brachyesophagus (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) were prospectively studied in 49 patients (50 operations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical and endoscopic findings, and 3-hour postprandial pH measurement including Kaye's score were evaluated at short (3 to 8 months), medium (1 to 4 years), and long-term (more than 4 years) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperative morbidity was 16 percent; there were 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (6 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Short term results, evaluated in 45 patients, were considered satisfactory in 30, poor (pyrosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>) in 2, and incomplete (pyrosis without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in 5, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 6) in 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long term results (32 patients) were satisfactory in 24, poor in 5, and incomplete in 3 (pyrosis without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in one, gastric outlet disorder in 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long term pH measurements were obtained in 21 patients: 3 out of 6 patients with high scores had clinical or endoscopic signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of late results showed that: a) satisfactory short term outcome was maintained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 patients (deterioration was observed in one patient 4 years later because of aggressive treatment for terminal bronchopulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; the other was observed 5 years later after steroid therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0276651" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergilloma</z:e> with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>); b) pH scores were variable in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This variability and discordance of pH measurements was most likely due to the presence of acid secretion above the new esogastric junction, which was observed in half of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Collis' gastroplasty provided good results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and might be compared to duodenal diversion in ulterior studies in this setting </plain></SENT>
