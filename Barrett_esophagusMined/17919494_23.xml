<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the ability of acid and NO to induce DNA damage in esophageal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transformed and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells were exposed to either acid, (pH 3.5), +/- <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> or NO from a donor or generated by acidification of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> +/- NO scavenger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H2AX and the neutral comet assay were used to detect DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species and NO were detected with fluorescent dyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> viability was measured with a rhodamine dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival was assessed by clonogenic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure to acid (pH 3.5) for &gt; or =15 minutes induced DSBs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a concomitant increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> damage, and pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> inhibited DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exposure to physiologic concentrations of NO produced from the NO donor or acidification of salivary <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> induced DSBs in a dose- (&gt;25 micromol/L) and cell-dependent manner (<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> &gt;<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This occurred preferentially in S-phase cells consistent with stalled replication forks and was blocked with a NO scavenger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NO also induced DSBs in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cells treated ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cells were able to survive when exposed to acid and NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both acid and NO have the potential to generate DSBs in the esophagus and via distinct mechanisms </plain></SENT>
