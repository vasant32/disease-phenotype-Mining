<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Barrett's is the only accepted precursor lesion for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> that is rapidly increasing in incidence in western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BE evolves into EAC through intermediate steps that involve increasing degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Current histologic criteria are quite subjective and the clinical behavior of BE is highly variable and difficult to predict using these standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is widely believed that molecular alterations present in BE and EAC will provide more precise prognostic and predictive markers for these conditions than the current clinical and histologic features in use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to further define molecular alterations that can classify unique groups of BE and EAC, we utilized methylation microarrays to compare the global gene methylation status of a collection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous, BE, BE + high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and EAC cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found distinct global methylation signatures, as well as differential methylation of specific genes, that discriminated these histological groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also noted high and low methylation epigenotypes among the BE and EAC cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional validation of those CpG sites that distinguished BE from BE + HGD and EAC may lead to the discovery of useful biomarkers with potential clinical applications in the diagnosis and prognosis of BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
