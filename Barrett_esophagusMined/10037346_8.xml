<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To optimize photosensitizer administration, the kinetics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">5-aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> (ALA)-induced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> accumulation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and Barrett's-like esophagus were studied in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Animals received 200 mg/kg ALA intravenously (n = 21) or orally (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six rats served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hr, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> concentration in the esophagus was measured by using chemical extraction, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> localization was determined by laser scanning microscopy (LSM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in 20 animals, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17381">porphobilinogen</z:chebi> deaminase, ferrochelatase, and iron concentration were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a second group (n = 24), an esophagojejunostomy was performed to induce a Barrett's-like esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 18 weeks, animals received ALA, and LSM was performed at t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">Porphyrin</z:chebi> accumulation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa was 3.5-fold higher than in muscularis, with a maximum at 3 hr after ALA administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With LSM, strong homogeneous fluorescence of the squamous epithelium was shown, with minor fluorescence of submucosa and muscularis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's-like epithelium, fluorescence was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> but was also restricted to epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in fluorescence intensity between Barrett's-like and adjacent squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17381">Porphobilinogen</z:chebi> deaminase activity was higher and iron concentration was lower in the mucosa than in the muscularis (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ALA-induced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> accumulation selectively occurs in esophageal mucosa, whether <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or Barrett's-like, compared with the muscularis, with a maximum at 3 hr after ALA administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Selectivity may be caused by a different activity of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-synthetic enzymes or relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> in the mucosa </plain></SENT>
