<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: A common genetic abnormality detected in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is LOH (loss of heterozygosity) at the sites of known or putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, some deletions have also been determined in peritumoral Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a tissue field of somatic genetic alterations precede the histopathological phenotypic changes of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated 32 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with no evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> for LOH at 5q21 (APC), 3p21, 9p21 (p16) and 17p13.1 (p53) chromosomal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Two groups were randomly selected and compared: 16 cases of Barrett's epithelium adjacent to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 16 cases of Barrett's epithelium with no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in a 5-10 years follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> cases several previous endoscopic biopsies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We determined frequent allelic losses in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> at p53 (54%), p16 (50%), 3p21 (40%) and 5q21 (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Identical LOH was present in most cases in the Barrett's epithelium adjacent to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LOH at these loci was unusual in Barrett's epithelium with no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in cases where sequential endoscopic biopsies were performed in advance to the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> diagnosis LOH was already present in the Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that LOH at these loci may be present before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the malignant growth and LOH studies may supplement the histopathological evaluation of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LOH at 3p21, 5q21, 9p21 and 17p13 chromosomal regions in cells of Barrett's epithelium without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> may have a role as a potential marker for individuals with a high risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
