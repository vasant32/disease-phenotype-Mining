<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is a further investigation of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and benign mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen resection specimens were studied (seven for <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, seven for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, one for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at the gastroesophageal junction, and one for severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and mucosa were submitted according to a specimen diagram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymph node and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were studied when available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> expression was identified in paraffin-embedded tissues by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibody C219 and was scored as the percentage of cells stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> was identified in six of 16 resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intratumoral variability of C219 score was noted in three resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No increase in expression was identified in lymph node or distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> as compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> or in the invasive margin of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> as compared to the center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For every case in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> expressed P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, it was also diffusely present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of benign gastric and Barrett's mucosa, both adjacent to and distant from (up to 8 cm) the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also studied biopsies from 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> was only focally present in one of the 10 biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mucosa expressing P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> may be the substrate from which a P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> arises </plain></SENT>
