<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, which develops within <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, is frequently responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforation</z:mpath> is a rare complication constituting a great challenge for diagnosis and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three personal cases and 31 published reports of perforated Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The site of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, clinical presentation, management, and outcome were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical presentation proved to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and was determined by the site of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>: this was the pleural cavity (20% of cases), mediastinum (20%), left atrium (16.6%), tracheobronchial tract (13.3%), aorta (13.3%), pericardium (10%), or pulmonary vein (6.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early esophagectomy and esophageal diversion-exclusion were the most frequent procedures, and overall mortality was 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The poor prognosis of perforated Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> should be improved by earlier diagnosis and adequate emergent operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although early esophagectomy constitutes the recommended procedure, esophageal diversion-exclusion, which allows control of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, is also of interest </plain></SENT>
