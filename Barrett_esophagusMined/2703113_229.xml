<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reliable nonhistologic markers indicative of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> are not yet available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> a prospective follow-up study was performed on 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, without <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at entrance to the study, for a period of 1.5-14 yr (mean, 5.2 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Barrett's epithelium was classified as fundic type, junctional or cardia type, or specialized columnar type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When classification in one of these three types was not possible because of lack of the characteristic features of the epithelia, the epithelium was classified as intermediate type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At entrance to the study, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found in 6 patients, high-grade in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> increased in frequency as well as in severity and was found almost exclusively in the specialized columnar- and intermediate-type epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the observation period <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had been found in 13 patients, in 10 scored as low-grade and in 3 as high-grade, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had developed in another 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This prospective study shows an incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of 1 in 52 patient-years, a 125-fold increase compared with the general Dutch population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A sequence of worsening of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was observed in specialized columnar and intermediate-type epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study support the need for a long-term clinical, endoscopic, and histologic follow-up program in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
