<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One thousand consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms were included in the study over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were subjected to history taking including a questionnaire for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, clinical examination and upper digestive tract endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic signs suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) were defined as mucosal tongues or an upward shift of the squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BE was diagnosed by pathological examination when specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was detected histologically in suspected CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>pH was monitored in 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE was present in 7.3% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, with a mean age of 48.3 +/- 8.2 years, which was significantly higher than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> without BE (37.4 +/- 13.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was detected in eight cases (0.8%), six of them in BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between patients with BE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> regarding sex, smoking, alcohol consumption or symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE had significantly longer esophageal acid exposure time in the supine position, measured by pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of BE in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> who were referred for endoscopy was 7.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BE seems to be associated with older age and more in patients with nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
