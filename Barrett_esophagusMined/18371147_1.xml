<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> have recently been suggested to induce anticancer effects against a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in several, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the accompanying article by Ogunwobi and Beales, three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were shown to inhibit proliferation and stimulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in two EAC cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These effects were achieved by reducing Ras, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and protein kinase B (Akt)-related cellular signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although these results are promising, they are clearly preliminary, and much additional work is needed to confirm or refute the potential anticancer effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in human BEAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the work of Ogunwobi and Beales highlights the importance of developing better, more predictive in vitro and in vivo models of BEAC, and of taking promising, low-risk agents, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, into early-phase therapeutic and preventive clinical trials involving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, respectively </plain></SENT>
