<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is the metaplastic replacement of squamous with columnar epithelium in the esophagus, as a result of reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is the major risk factor for the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methylation of CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> of normally unmethylated genes is associated with silencing of their expression, and is common in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine at what stage, in the progression from BE to EAC, methylation of key genes occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We examined nine genes (APC, CDKN2A, ID4, MGMT, RBP1, RUNX3, SFRP1, TIMP3, and TMEFF2), frequently methylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple cancer</z:e> types, in a panel of squamous (19 biopsies from patients without BE or EAC, 16 from patients with BE, 21 from patients with EAC), BE (40 metaplastic, seven high grade dysplastic) and 37 EAC tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methylation frequency, the percentage of samples that had any extent of methylation, for each of the nine genes in the EAC (95%, 59%, 76%, 57%, 70%, 73%, 95%, 74% and 83% respectively) was significantly higher than in any of the squamous groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The methylation frequency for each of the nine genes in the metaplastic BE (95%, 28%, 78%, 48%, 58%, 48%, 93%, 88% and 75% respectively) was significantly higher than in the squamous samples except for CDKN2A and RBP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The methylation frequency did not differ between BE and EAC samples, except for CDKN2A and RUNX3 which were significantly higher in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The methylation extent was an estimate of both the number of methylated alleles and the density of methylation on these alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was significantly greater in EAC than in metaplastic BE for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genes except APC, MGMT and TIMP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in methylation extent for any gene between high grade dysplastic BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found significant methylation in metaplastic BE, which for seven of the nine genes studied did not differ in frequency from that found in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is also the first report of gene silencing by methylation of ID4 in BE or EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that metaplastic BE is a highly abnormal tissue, more similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue than to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium </plain></SENT>
