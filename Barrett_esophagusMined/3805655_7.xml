<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> occurred in 11% of patients with biopsy-proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease occurred only in males at one center, and in a 7:1 ratio of males to females at the other center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clear racial predilection was seen, since 12 of 13 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus were white, whereas less than 20% of patients with squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus were white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The finding of Barrett's epithelium in eight of the 13 cases strongly supports the theory that in white males, Barrett's epithelium is a precursor lesion of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus/esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
