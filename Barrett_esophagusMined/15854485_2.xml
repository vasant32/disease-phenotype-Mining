<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study was made among a total of 15,228 consecutive patients, 8,573 male and 6,655 female, aged 54 (8-95), undergoing gastroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were carefully inquired, especially those regarding possible complaints including discomfort of throat and swallowing pain and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Special care was taken in the upper esophageal sphincter area to make sure whether the area was adequately inspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens from aberrant mucosa were obtained and the sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, and Giemsa stain for Helicobacter pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HGMUE was found in 39 patients (0.26%) with an average age of 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients with H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in heterotopic gastric mucosa also presented the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gastric mucosa was gastric body type in 8 patients, transitional type in 11 patients, and antral pattern in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was found in 5 patients, and mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_483'>atypical hyperplasia</z:mpath> in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An impressive finding was coexistent erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> in 14 patients (35.9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in one patient (2.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> in 8 patients (20.5%), and a patient had the complication of constriction in the upper esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HGMUE is not rare in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of inlet patches is possibly correlated with specific symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There are some severe complications in HGMUE, especially esophageal constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Close surveillance should be taken for rare cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in HGMUE </plain></SENT>
