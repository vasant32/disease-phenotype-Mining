<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) which acts by laser irradiation with an appropriate wave-length after administration of a photosensitiser retained preferentially by the cancerous tissue can destroy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells selectively, but its efficiency depends upon the photosensitiser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results presented concern 10 sites on Barrett's mucosa (BO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They consisted of either an association of intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (IMC) with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method consisted of intravenous injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9437">Temoporfin</z:chebi> 0,15 mg/kg 4 days before irradiation of the lesion with a green laser light emitting 514 nm through a windowed diffuser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The light fluence was 75 J per cm2 and irradiation 100 mW per cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Irradiation time was 12,5 mn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">Omeprazole</z:chebi> was routinely prescribed after treatment at a dose of 40 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The follow-up protocol was 2 years with endoscopic surveillance at 2, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biopsies obligatory at 2 and 3 months were in fact carried out at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was judged on the absence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intra mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> on biopsies at treated sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Undesirable side effects noted have been moderate for the most part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No stenosis appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment has been 100% successful for the 10 lesion after 15 treatments with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The follow up varies from 6-36 months and was more than 18 months for 6 lesions on 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our series has demonstrated a great <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in lesions which were sometimes visible and highly localised, but more often invisible, multi-focal and diagnosable only by biopsy at different levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In keeping with the literature and our experience, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> has several advantages over the other locally curative therapies, mucosectomy and thermocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These are the possible treatments without general anaesthesia, selectively for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, an action on more extensive areas with eradication of non visible lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9437">Temoporfin</z:chebi> has contributed notably to the field of photodynamic therapy compared to previously used sensitisers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It is a pure, synthetic product which guarantees more reproducible results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Compared with Photofrin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9437">Temoporfin</z:chebi> has many advantages with smaller doses of drugs and less energy, better selectivity and rapid elimination which reduce the risk period for photosensitisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The frequency of important undesirable side effects is diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Finally, it produces a consistent effect on the surface and in depth producing a complete reepithelialisation of the treated zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Subject to validation of the method on a greater number of patients, the first results obtained on superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in Barrett's aesophagus allow us to propose green light <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9437">Temoporfin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> as an alternative first line therapy with curative intent </plain></SENT>
