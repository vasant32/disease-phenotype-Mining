<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>p63 is a p53-related DNA-binding protein that helps regulate differentiation and proliferation in epithelial progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its expression has never been evaluated in the human gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of p63 in the esophagus and related metaplastic and neoplastic disorders to gain insight into the pathogenesis of these processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest was the expression of p63 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and in BE-associated multilayered epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multilayered epithelium has been postulated to represent an early precursor to the development of BE primarily because it shares morphologic and immunophenotypic features of both squamous and columnar epithelium, and has been shown prospectively to be highly associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Routinely processed mucosal biopsy or resection specimens that contained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous epithelium (n = 20), squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (n = 7), BE (n = 10), BE-associated multilayered epithelium (n = 13), esophageal mucosal gland ducts (n = 10), BE-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 12), and BE-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 7) were immunostained for p63 to determine the extent and location of staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p63 staining was compared with the staining patterns observed for p53, Ki 67 (proliferation marker), and cytokeratins (CKs) 13 (squamous marker), 14 (basal squamous marker), 8/18 (columnar marker), and 19 (basal/columnar marker) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of p63 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) isoforms was also analyzed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of freshly isolated tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, p63 was expressed in the basal and suprabasal layers of the squamous epithelium and in basal cells that line the mucosal gland ducts but was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, small intestine, and colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, p63 was not expressed in BE, but it, was present in the basal layer of multilayered epithelium in 9 of 13 cases (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>p63-positive cells in multilayered epithelium and in the mucosal gland duct epithelium were positive for CK8/18 (100%) and CK13 (67% and 30%, respectively) and negative for CK14 (0%), in contrast to p63-positive cells in squamous epithelium, which were positive for CK14 and CK13 (100%) but negative for CK8/18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In neoplastic tissues, p63 was diffusely expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of esophageal squamous cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> but was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of esophageal and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The DeltaN isoform of p63 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> predominated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> benign and neoplastic squamous tissues examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>p63 may represent a marker of 2 distinct epithelial progenitor cells (basal squamous epithelium and gland duct epithelium) in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>P63 is upregulated in squamous neoplastic conditions and in this manner may play a role in squamous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data also indicate that multilayered epithelium is phenotypically similar to, and may share a lineage relationship with, mucosal gland duct epithelium </plain></SENT>
