<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of CDX2 in a well-defined series of human esophageal tissues, comprising reflux-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, premalignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), and primary esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EADC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore potential molecular regulatory mechanisms, we also studied the expression of beta-catenin, SOX9, and CDX2 promoter methylation in esophageal tissues, in addition to the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) on CDX2 expression in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human esophageal cell line Het1A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative to matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelia, CDX2 was overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (37% for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>; cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in 48% of tissues), a high proportion (91%) of BE tissues, and in EADC (57% for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>; cell nuclear immunopositivity in 80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An association with beta-catenin expression was seen, but not with SOX9 or CDX2 promoter methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Het1A cells, CDX2 was upregulated following exposure to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and NO, alone and in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results further implicate CDX2 and beta-catenin in the molecular pathogenesis of human EADC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observed synergistic effect of NO on the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>-induction of CDX2 suggests a novel role for NO in modulating the development of the Barrett phenotype and esophageal adenocarcinogenesis </plain></SENT>
