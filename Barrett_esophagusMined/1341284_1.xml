<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study was planned to establish the origins of adeno <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the mid-thoracic oesophagus and to carry out a comparative evaluation of the results of surgery of such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> derived from different origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECT: 58 patients with adeno <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the mid-thoracic oesophagus undergoing surgical resection (10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resected patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protocol of the study: clinical, radiological, endoscopic and intra-operative study together with serial histopathological examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resected specimens, follow-up check </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four types of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were identified according to their origin judged by the study results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type 1: in 29 patients (20 males, 9 females) the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> had risen from the cardia and had extended upwards in one continuous sheet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 2: in 16 cases (8 males, 8 females) adeno <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> had originated from the stomach within a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and had extended to the "mid" oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 3: 2 patients (1 male, 1 female) had adeno <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the mid-oesophagus surrounded by squamous epithelium and presumably originated from oesophageal glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type 4: in 11 patients (10 males, 1 female) the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> had clearly risen from columnar epithelial lined oesophagus (Barrett) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SURGICAL RESULTS: 2 patients died in hospital and one at home 25 days after operation (total mortality just over 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no serious morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The long-term results per type were: Type 1: 4 survived 5 years or more, the remainder survived 14 months on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Type 2: 2 survived 5 years or more, the remainder survived 16 months on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Type 3: None survived 5 years, 2 survived 10 and 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Type 4: None survived 5 years, 2 average survived was 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Only 20% of the adeno <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the mid-oesophagus are associated with Barrett and these have the worst prognosis after surgical resection </plain></SENT>
