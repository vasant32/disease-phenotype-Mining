<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Preliminary studies with qualitative detection methods suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">5-aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX fluorescence might improve the detection of dysplastic Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study used quantitative methods to determine whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX fluorescence can differentiate between Barrett's mucosa with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were given 10 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> orally 3 hours before endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative fluorescence spectra were acquired by using a nitrogen-pumped dye laser (l 400 nm) spectrograph system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX fluorescence intensity at 635 nm was compared with the histopathologic diagnosis for mucosal biopsy specimens taken immediately after the fluorescence measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-seven spectra were obtained from 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- standard error) standardized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX fluorescence intensity was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.05) for high-grade dysplastic Barrett's epithelium (0.29 +/- 0.07, n = 13) than for nondysplastic Barrett's epithelium (0.11 +/- 0.02, n = 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX fluorescence alone, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was distinguished from nondysplastic tissue types with 77% sensitivity and 71% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreased autofluorescence was particularly found in nodular high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By using the fluorescence intensity ratio of 635 nm/480 nm, nodular high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> could be differentiated from nondysplastic tissue with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">Protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX fluorescence may be useful for identifying areas of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and for targeting of biopsies </plain></SENT>
