<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare outcome of vagal-sparing esophagectomy with transhiatal and en bloc esophagectomy in patients with intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> have a low likelihood of lymphatic or systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and esophagectomy is curative in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, traditional esophagectomy is associated with significant morbidity and altered gastrointestinal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A vagal-sparing esophagectomy offers the advantages of complete disease removal with the potential for reduced morbidity and a better functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective review of outcome in patients with intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> that had a vagal-sparing (n=49), transhiatal (n=39) or en bloc (n=21) esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The length of hospital stay and the incidence of major complications was significantly reduced with a vagal-sparing esophagectomy compared with a transhiatal or en bloc resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, postvagotomy dumping and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> symptoms were significantly less common, and weight was better maintained postoperatively with a vagal-sparing esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458156" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Recurrent cancer</z:e> has developed in only 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Survival with intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or Barrett's with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is independent of the type of resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A vagal-sparing esophagectomy is associated with significantly less perioperative morbidity and a shorter hospital stay than a transhiatal or en bloc esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, late morbidity including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, dumping, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> are significantly less likely after a vagal-sparing approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consequently a vagal-sparing esophagectomy is the preferred procedure for patients with intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
