<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advances in minimally invasive techniques now allow minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) to be performed that may minimize the morbidity of this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this report was to summarize our experience with MIE in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From February 1997 through February 2001, 41 patients (14 women, 27 men) 75 years of age or older (mean age 78, range 75 to 89) underwent esophagectomy (28 for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 7 squamous, 6 Barrett's with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Esophagectomy was performed in a minimally invasive fashion in 41 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No open conversions were necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median ICU stay was 1 day (range 1 to 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median hospital stay was 7 days (range 5 to 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major morbidity occurred in 19% of the cases and included 1 persistent air leak, 1 case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, 1 tracheal tear, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo>, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three anastomotic leaks and 1 small bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were recognized early and treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No perioperative mortalities took place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our center, MIE was performed in elderly patients with an acceptable morbidity, low mortality, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001258'>reduced length</z:mp> of hospital stay compared with that in previous reports </plain></SENT>
