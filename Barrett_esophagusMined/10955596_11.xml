<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it has been reported that short-segment BE may be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to define the prevalence of BE and the mucin profile in BE, including the short-segment type, and to compare the mucin profile in BE with the profiles of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and distal esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> among Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 650 adult subjects underwent endoscopic examination for evaluation of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the prevalence of traditional (long segment) BE was 0.62%, the overall prevalence of BE including short-segment type was 15.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's epithelium, the short-segment type predominantly had gastric type mucin, while the middle- and long-segment types possessed intestinal mucin, especially colonic type mucin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29922">sulfo</z:chebi>-Lewis(a)), with high frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's epithelium with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Barrett's epithelium adjacent to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> showed a predominance of immunoreactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29922">sulfo</z:chebi>-Lewis(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, colonic type mucin was detected in 100% by monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 91.9H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small-intestinal mucin and gastric mucin were stained in 50% and 12.5% of the subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colonic type mucin was also detected with high frequency (80%) in distal esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> without Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, not of small-intestinal type or gastric type mucin, but of colonic type mucin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29922">sulfo</z:chebi>-Lewis(a)), may be associated with, at least in part, the malignant phenotype of BE </plain></SENT>
