<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on the prevalence of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) in biopsy taken from an incidental irregular Z line are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the prevalence of SIM in biopsies taken from an incidental irregular Z line in consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the study period, we identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult patients who underwent an upper endoscopy with biopsies from an incidental finding of an irregular Z line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics, prevalence of endoscopic findings, and major complaints were compared between those with SIM and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 166 out of 2000 (8.3%) consecutive patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was found in 43.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Male sex and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> were predictors of SIM (P=0.043 and 0.001, respectively), with relative risks of 2.02 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-4.0) and 3.31 (95% confidence interval: 1.66-6.58), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this endoscopic and histological study, SIM was found to be a common finding in patients with irregular Z line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male sex and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000776'>diaphragmatic hernia</z:hpo> were significantly associated with the presence of SIM </plain></SENT>
