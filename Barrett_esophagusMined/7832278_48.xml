<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study analyzed 67 patients (mean age, 64 years; male-to-female ratio, 10:1) with an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> treated by surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of smokers was 63%, alcohol users, 45%, and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients had another synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and seven patients, previous esophageal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty percent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were well differentiated, 31% moderately differentiated, 15% poorly differentiated, 7% mucinous, and 6% composed of signet-ring cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Depth of invasion in the esophageal wall was limited to mucosa in 13% of cases and submucosa in 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> extended to the muscular layer in 12% of cases, to adventitia in 33%, and to periesophageal tissue in 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vascular and perineural neoplastic invasion was present in 67 and 38% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regional lymph node involvement and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were found in 51 and 9% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates were 63, 41, and 32%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival rate was significantly better for patients with superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> limited to mucosa or submucosa (82 vs. 12%) or without regional lymph node involvement (59 vs. 10%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate Cox regression analysis for overall survival, depth of invasion in the esophageal wall and regional lymph node involvement were independent prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Careful pathologic staging is of value in determining the prognosis of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
