<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The accuracy of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosis is not well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the accuracy of a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosis and the reproducibility of an esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosis between 1994 and 2005 were identified by use of International Classification of Disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) coding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsets received manual record review (endoscopy/pathology reports), slide review by a referral pathologist (interrater reliability), and 2 blinded reviews by the same pathologist (intrarater reliability) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: An integrated health services delivery system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Accuracy of electronic clinical diagnosis and reproducibility of esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2470 patients coded with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent record review; a subgroup (616) received manual pathology slide review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Review confirmed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosis for 1533 (61.9%) patients: 437 of 798 subjects (54.8%) with a SNOMED diagnosis alone, 153 of 671 subjects (26.8%) with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> diagnosis alone, and 940 of 1101 subjects (85%) who had both a SNOMED and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> diagnosis occurred with 88.3% of subjects (original vs referral pathologist, interrater reliability; kappa = .42, 95% CI, 0.34-0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The referral pathologist made the same <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> diagnosis twice for a given patient for 88.6% of subjects (intrarater reliability, 2 reviews by same pathologist; kappa = 0.65, 95% CI, 0.35-0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The accuracy of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosis likely represents the minimum number, given the strict criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A community pathologist's diagnosis of esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> is likely to be confirmed by a referral pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Electronic diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> overestimate the prevalence, although they are usually confirmed in patients with both a SNOMED and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
