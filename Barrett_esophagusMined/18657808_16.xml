<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: EMR is an accepted treatment for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the limitations of this technique is that extensive mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection may be required to obtain complete removal of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, which may result in significant stricture formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of an endoscopically deployed extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold material for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo> after circumferential EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Ten mongrel dogs were subjected to surgical plane anesthesia and circumferential esophageal EMR by the cap technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 5 animals, an ECM scaffold material was endoscopically placed at the resection site; the remaining 5 animals were subjected to circumferential esophageal EMR without ECM placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up endoscopy was performed at 4 and 8 weeks; necropsy with histologic assessment was performed at 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Animal laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Circumferential esophageal EMR by the cap technique, followed by endoscopic placement of an ECM scaffold material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> and histologic assessment of remodeled esophageal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 control dogs had endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three required early euthanasia because of inability to tolerate oral intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incomplete epithelialization and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> persisted at the EMR site in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic placement of an ECM scaffold material prevented clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Histologic assessment showed near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal tissue with a lack of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or scar tissue at 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic placement of an ECM scaffold material prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> formation after circumferential EMR in this canine model during short-term observation </plain></SENT>
