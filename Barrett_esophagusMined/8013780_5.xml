<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of endoscopic surveillance for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is to grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the observer variation in diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven biopsies selected from Barrett's mucosa reported as having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> between 1987 and 1988 were reviewed by 4 pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biopsies were classified according to the method of Riddell, as no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each pathologist reviewed the biopsies alone and then together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a total agreement between the 4 pathologists in 20 out of 37 biopsies (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pair-wise agreement varied between 65 and 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was 84% when the pathologists belonged to the same institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 222 double reviews made by 6 pairs of pathologists (37 biopsies x 6 pairs of pathologists), there were 58 disagreements: 19 low grade/high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 2 high grade/indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 1 high grade/no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 18 low grade/indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 2 low grade/no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 16 indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the second review when the pathologists evaluated the biopsies together, the agreement was 92%; there were 3 biopsies on which there was total disagreement: twice between high grade and low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, once between low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study has shown that disagreement between pathologists was rarely found on the biopsies diagnosed as having high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, more often on those diagnosed as having low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
