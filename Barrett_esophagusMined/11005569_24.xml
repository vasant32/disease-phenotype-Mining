<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prolonged use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) has been shown to exert a chemopreventive effect in esophageal and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017185" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanism by which this occurs, however, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the inhibition of COX-2 as a potential explanation for this chemopreventive effect has gained a great deal of support, there also exists evidence supporting the presence of cyclooxygenase-independent pathways through which <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> may exert their effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, immunohistochemical analysis of 29 Barrett's epithelial samples and 60 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> demonstrated abundant expression of the COX-2 protein in Barrett's epithelium, but marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of expression in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines, Flo-1, Bic-1, and Seg-1, also demonstrated varying expression patterns for COX-1 and COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">Indomethacin</z:chebi> induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lines, however, in both a time- and dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Flo-1 cells, which expressed almost undetectable levels of COX-1 and COX-2, and in Seg-1, which expressed significant levels of COX-1 and COX-2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> caused upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The upregulation of Bax was accompanied by the translocation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> to the cytoplasm, and activation of caspase 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment of both cell lines with the specific caspase 9 inhibitor, z-LEHD-FMK, as well as the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK, blocked the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells is associated with the upregulation of Bax expression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> translocation, and does not correlate with the expression of COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may have important implications for identifying new therapeutic targets in this deadly disease </plain></SENT>
