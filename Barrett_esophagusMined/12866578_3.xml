<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Columnar cells are the prevalent element of BE, but the hallmark of intestinal differentiation is the goblet population that defines the specialised columnar epithelium (SCE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that columnar cells adjacent to Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BA) exhibit enterocytic features in areas with and without SCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and the presence of these elements is not established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether intestinal differentiated cells, other than goblet cells, are associated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> we compared the prevalence of enterocytic features in columnar elements with and without associated BA through the use of sucrase-isomaltase (SI) immunoreactivity in 31 columnar esophageal segments (CLES) and 12 BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, SI was only expressed at the columnar cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apical staining was exclusive of CLES with SCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SI was present at the cytoplasm in 22.2% of CLES without SCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apical SI occurred in BE with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, similarly in areas with and without SCE (p = 0.11 and p = 0.50, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In areas with SCE, columnar cells with apical SI were more frequent in cases of BE adjacent to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> than in cases without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> but the difference did not reach significance (p = 0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In areas without SCE, apical SI was significantly (p = 0.01) more frequent in cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Apical SI was equally found in neoplastic as in metaplastic areas, with and without SCE, (p = 0.07 and p = 0.40, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion this study on the frequency of SI on CLES with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> demonstrated that additionally to SCE, metaplastic enterocytic cells are also associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It also confirmed that the presence of intestinal features are underestimated if only goblet elements are used for its identification, reinforcing the utility of the immunohistochemical recognition of enterocytic characteristics for establishing the diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
