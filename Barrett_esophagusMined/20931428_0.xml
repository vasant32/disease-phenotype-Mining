<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>-squamocolumnar junction in patients with progressive systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and to investigate the association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients with progressive systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (Group A), 58 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>--without progressive systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (Group B) and 36 patients without progressive systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (Group C) were prospectively enrolled into this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were taken from the antrum, body, squamocolumnar junction (Z-line), and from the esophagus (3 cm above the Z-line) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsies were independently evaluated by two pathologists who were unaware of the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that grade C-D <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were statistically significantly higher in Group A (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at squamocolumnar junction was detected in 31% of Group A, in 32% of Group B and in 29% of Group C patients (p&gt;0.05), and prevalence of Helicobacter pylori was 61%, 67% and 38% in Groups A, B and C, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori was similar in Group B and Group A, and significantly higher in Group B than Group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within each group, no significant relationship was detected between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at squamocolumnar junction and gender, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and prevalence of Helicobacter pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with progressive systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> have a higher tendency to the more severe forms and complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> than in those without progressive systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference in the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at squamocolumnar junction between groups, and it can be pointed out that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at squamocolumnar junction might not be related with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
