<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1988 and June 1997 was diagnosed 46 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tem was analyzed the age, the follow-up period, the chief presenting symptoms leading to endoscopy, endoscopy <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at the time of Barrett's diagnosis was 58 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 43 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms were heartburn in 35 (76%) patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in 3 (6.5%), thoracic pain 3 (6.5%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> 2 (4.5%) and others in 3 (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was present in 24 (52%) patients during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications developed was stricture, ulceration or haemorrhage in 14 (30.4%) patients, two (4.3%) have <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was 1/82 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of the three presented with heartburn and the mean follow-up until development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was 63 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Heartburn and endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> is frequent in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The risk of development of and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or others complications is high </plain></SENT>
