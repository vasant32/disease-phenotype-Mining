<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic reversal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with multipolar electrocoagulation and high-dose <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> has been previously described but long-term results are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to follow patients after endoscopic reversal and to perform a detailed analysis of the "new" squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After reversal, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were maintained on high-dose <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> and underwent interval endoscopy, and large biopsies were obtained of the former Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine of 11 patients were men; the mean age was 62 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean length of Barrett's mucosa was 4.4 cm; the mean dose of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> used was 49 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had an initial complete response to treatment-no evidence of Barrett's endoscopically and histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> underlying the new squamous mucosa in the latest follow-up biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these 3 patients, only 0.4%, 2%, and 8% of the total biopsy area had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 4 patients had underlying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at variable times during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients have been followed for a mean of 36 months (range 19 to 53 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: New squamous mucosa is durable and resembles <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Underlying glands of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> are intermittently found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because the significance of this residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> is unclear, surveillance endoscopy with biopsies of the treated segment is recommended even after reversal therapy </plain></SENT>
