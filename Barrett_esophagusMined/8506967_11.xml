<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Motility records of 70 patients with histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the swallow responses was made between those patients who had a limited Barrett's segment (3 to 5 cm, n = 28) as opposed to those patients who had an extensive Barrett's segment (greater than 5 cm, n = 42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with an extensive segment had a significantly lower amplitude (p &lt; 0.01) of esophageal contraction and a significantly longer duration (p &lt; 0.01) of contraction compared with patients with a limited segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These differences were most marked in the distal esophageal segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a progressive deterioration of esophageal motility with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
