<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 1280 patients diagnosed with CLO and registered with the UK National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> Registry were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data, including smoking habits, were collected from the patient's notes and development of HGD or AC noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis was performed with SPSS using logistic regression for calculation of odds ratios (ORs) for development of HGD/AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on smoking habits were available in 956 (74.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between smokers and nonsmokers in mean age (P=0.877) or length of follow-up (P=0.359) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant risk of HGD/AC in patients with any history of smoking compared with those who had never smoked (P&lt;0.001, OR 2.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ex-smokers of 10 years or more remained at a significantly higher risk of HGD/AC compared with those who had never smoked (P=0.001, OR 3.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current smokers were not at a significantly higher risk of HGD/AC compared with ex-smokers (P=0.857) nor were those who smoked at least 20 a day compared with those who smoked fewer than 20 a day (P=0.632) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with CLO, smoking appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of severe dysplastic disease; however, we did not observe a dose-dependent effect of smoking on progression of disease </plain></SENT>
