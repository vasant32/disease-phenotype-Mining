<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over the last two decades, the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) has increased dramatically in the US and Western Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that EAs evolve from premalignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) tissue by a process of clonal expansion and evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular phenotype of the premalignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, and its relationship to those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> upper gastrointestinal (GI) mucosae, including gastric, duodenal, and squamous epithelium of the esophagus, has not been systematically characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we used oligonucleotide-based microarrays to characterize gene expression profiles in each of these tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The similarity of BE to each of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues was compared using a series of computational approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our analyses included esophageal squamous epithelium, which is present at the same anatomic site and exposed to similar conditions as Barrett's epithelium, duodenum that shares morphologic similarity to Barrett's epithelium, and adjacent gastric epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a clear distinction among the expression profiles of gastric, duodenal, and squamous epithelium whereas the BE profiles showed considerable overlap with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified clusters of genes that are specific to each of the tissues, to the Barrett's metaplastic epithelia, and a cluster of genes that was distinct between squamous and non-squamous epithelia </plain></SENT>
