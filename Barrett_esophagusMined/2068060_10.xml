<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven patients with biopsy-proven <z:mp ids='MP_0002163'>glandular dysplasia</z:mp> of the esophagus (39 patients) or stomach (38 patients) were followed for a mean of 44 mo or until resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 34 patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at initial biopsy, 29 had no evidence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> on follow-up, three died of other causes, and two had severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> diagnosed on subsequent biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 43 patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 28 had no evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on follow-up (four died of unrelated causes and two of postoperative complications) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen were shown to have invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 15 diagnoses of invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were made within 12 mo of original endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ulcerated high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> were more likely associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> than were nonulcerated high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of ulceration and short time interval to the progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> may have been present at the time of initial biopsy in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>'s arising in severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was slightly less in the stomach (29%) than in the esophagus (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is often indolent and that ulcerated high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is often a marker for adjacent invasion </plain></SENT>
