<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that the potent neovascularization marker endoglin (CD105), by differentially highlighting a subset of microvessels (MV) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> (EC), could provide better prognostic/therapeutic information than the panendothelial marker CD34, which also highlights MV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoglin messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, malignant, and adjacent nontumorous esophagus tissue was quantified by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were analyzed immunohistochemically for CD105 and CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MV density was counted following a standard protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circulating soluble endoglin levels were determined in patient and control sera, and compared with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD105 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was upregulated by a median factor of 2.89 in ECs versus controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 28% of patients, CD105 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was upregulated by a median factor of 2.65 in adjacent non-tumorous versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues, CD105 was stained negatively or positively only in a subset of MV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD34 always showed positive extensive MV staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In adjacent nontumorous esophagus, CD105 rarely showed diffuse MV staining, while CD34 stained blood-vessel endothelial cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-neoplastic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD105 expression was high in residual highly dysplastic Barrett's-type mucosa associated with some <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference in endoglin serum levels appeared between patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Correlation with clinicopathological data showed higher intra-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> MV-CD105+ scores at more-advanced clinical stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>High-scoring MV-CD105+ patients had significantly shorter disease-free and overall survival; MV-CD34+ density was not survival related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Diffuse CD105 expression in adjacent nontumorous esophagus predicted poorer disease-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings could help identify EC patients who may benefit from targeted anti-angiogenic therapies </plain></SENT>
