<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Although discrete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> are a recognized complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, it is not clear how common discrete ulceration is in Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the relationship of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal hemorrhage</z:hpo> to Barrett's ulceration is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These issues were investigated in this paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with histologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were monitored by endoscopic surveillance over 1 to 11 years (mean 3.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of a Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was noted and its site recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal hemorrhage</z:hpo> at diagnosis or on follow-up was documented and the source of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Discrete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were identified in 36 of 78 patients (46%) at some time over the period of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had two or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were in the distal esophagus; 86% of these were within 3 cm of the anatomic gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (24%) either presented with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> or had <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 15 of the 19 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (79%) a discrete Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was the source of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ulceration is a common complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> are usually located close the gastroesophageal junction and have a high incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
