<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 14, seven were cared for in special institutions for brain damaged and 2 had been operated upon for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014850" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">oesophageal atresia</z:e> at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Excessive acid exposure was documented in 8/10 patient studied and simultaneous gastric and oesophageal pH-monitoring demonstrated massive duodeno-gastric alkaline reflux in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological studies revealed that columnar-lined epithelium was of fundic type in 2 cases, of junctional type in 7 and of specialized type in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Helicobacter pylori was found in the mucosa of 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present series confirms that BE should be looked for endoscopically in children with GER and provides further evidence of the long duration of GER disease and the excessive acid-alkaline chemical exposure of the oesophageal lining in the pathogenesis of mucosal changes </plain></SENT>
