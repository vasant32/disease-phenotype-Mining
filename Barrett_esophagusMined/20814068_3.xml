<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the progression of BE toward <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus has not been extensively studied in experimental models of BE in animals and in human subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the expression of COX-2 in rat model of BE and examined the usefulness of COX-2 expression in determining the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in patients with BE treated with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) that allows for effective ablation of metaplastic mucosa (group A) without or with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the group B of patients was subjected to laparoscopic Nissen's fundoplication and group K that served as control, received <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of COX-2 was evaluated in fresh-frozen biopsy specimens obtained from the distal esophagus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 60 patients before and 12 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In experimental studies, eighty rats were surgically prepared with esophagogastroduodenal anastomosis (EGDA) resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 4 months, the esophageal damage in EGDA rats was evaluated by macroscopic and histological index score, the plasma IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels was determined by ELISA and the mucosal expression of COX-2 mRNA and COX-2 protein were assessed by RT-PCR and Western Blot, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EGDA animals followed by the rise in the plasma TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histology revealed extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004791'>esophageal ulcerations</z:hpo> with development of columnar epithelium, formation of mucus glands in squamous epithelium, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> distant to anastomosis consisting of goblet cells, infiltration of inflammatory cells including plasma cells and lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>COX-2 mRNA was absent in the esophageal mucosa of sham-control animals but strongly upregulated in metaplastic Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In BE patients, the overexpression of COX-2 was documented in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After APC (group A) or Nissen's fundoplication (group B), the expression of COX-2 mRNA was markedly reduced and these effects were positively correlated with histopathological findings </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 1) EGDA rats serve as the suitable model of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> by the gastrointestinal refluxate resembling many features of those observed in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, as confirmed by severe <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> changes, excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and overexpression of COX-2, and 2) the significant correlation of the degree of COX-2 overexpression with histopathological findings indicates the usefulness of this inducible biomarker as a valuable indicator of the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
