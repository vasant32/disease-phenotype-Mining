<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The classic diagnosis of Barret esophagus is based on the finding of three of more cm of distal esophagus covered by specialized columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, at the present time, it is based on the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the junction of squamous-columnar mucosae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the prevalence of Barret esophagus using endoscopic and pathological criteria in healthy subjects and in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty nine controls and 372 patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> subjected to an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with Barret esophagus were classified as having a "mini Barret" when the pathological presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was the only finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A "short Barret esophagus" was diagnosed when less than 3 cm were covered with fingerings of mucosal substitutions and "extensive Barret esophagus" when more than 3 cm of esophageal mucosa were substituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two percent of controls, 12.4% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and 11.7% of such patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with Barret esophagus were older than the rest of patients. "Short Barret esophagus" is six times more frequent than "extensive Barret esophagus" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcers</z:hpo> and stenosis were more frequent in patients with extensive Barret esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of Barret esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was very infrequent in control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, classic endoscopic diagnosis may miss up to 80% of patients with Barret esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, gastroesophageal junction biopsies must be obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
