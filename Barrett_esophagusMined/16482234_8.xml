<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) usually suffer from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> and duodenogastroesophageal reflux (DGER) simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The question of whether DGER has an important effect on the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of DGER in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and its value for the diagnosis of nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> was initially diagnosed using the reflux disease questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For further diagnosis, results of the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (excluding a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) were considered in conjunction with simultaneous 24 h esophageal pH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to endoscopic findings, 95 patients (43 men, 50+/-10 years of age) were divided into two groups: the reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE) group (n=51) and the NERD group (n=44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three DGER parameters, the percentage of time with absorbance greater than 0.14, the total number of reflux episodes and the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> episodes lasting longer than 5 min, were evaluated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the RE group, the values of the DGER parameters (19.05%+/-23.44%, 30.56+/-34.04 and 5.90+/-6.37, respectively) were significantly higher than those of the NERD group (7.26%+/-11.08%, 15.68+/-20.92 and 2.59+/-3.57, respectively, P&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) but no significant difference was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of NERD patients, 18.5% were diagnosed with simple DGER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive diagnosis rate of NERD could be significantly elevated from 65.9% to 84.1% (P&lt;0.05), if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring was employed in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DGER may occur independently but plays an important role in the development of RE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous 24 h esophageal pH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring is superior to simple pH monitoring in helping identify patients at risk for NERD </plain></SENT>
