<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) by histopathologic biopsy assessment is suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A proliferation marker, minichromosome maintenance protein 2, has potential as a biomarker but lacks specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that cyclin A, which detects a proportion of proliferating cells, would be more specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because cytologic sampling has clinical advantages, we also evaluated the efficacy of cyclin A in endoscopic brushing samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A cross-sectional cyclin A immunostaining study was done in 77 patients attending for BE surveillance and 17 patients undergoing evaluation of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control tissues were as follows: 30 squamous esophagus, 20 gastric antrum, and 13 duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A nested case-control study was done within the same surveillance cohort (16 progressors compared with 32 matched controls) to determine the relative risk for progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunocytology was done for endoscopic brushings collected prospectively from 75 BE +/- <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 33 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surface expression of cyclin A in BE samples correlated with the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the case-control cohort, patients with biopsies expressing cyclin A at the surface were more likely to progress to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> than those who did not (odds ratio, 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-30.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of cyclin A expression in brushings for the detection of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were 97.8% and 58.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The associated negative predictive value was 97.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cyclin A immunopositivity correlates with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Application of this marker to endoscopic brushings could be used as a first step to identify BE patients with the highest risk of progression </plain></SENT>
