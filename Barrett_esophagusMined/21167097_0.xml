<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> progression is a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (CGR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with this condition are frequently infected by Helicobacter pylori and show several symptoms including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, they present an increased risk for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several pathogenic markers for Helicobacter pylori such as ureC, vacA and cagA genes have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evidence indicates that direct injury to the epithelial mucosa is caused by cytotoxins and enzymes codified by these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to establish a relationship between the presence of pathogenic Helicobacter pylori strains and the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> progression in patients with CGR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We detected the presence of Helicobacter pylori cagA and vacA positive strains in patients with CGR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using polymerase chain reaction, we analyzed 120 samples obtained from 60 patients with CGR and 60 control group patients, including samples from both anatomic areas: cardia and gastric antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results: We detected 56% of Helicobacter pylori positive patients; 57.5% of these patients were positive for either cagA(+) and/or vacA(+) Helicobacter pylori strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was observed in 35% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A marked tendency was observed to develop cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in those patients diagnosed with high-pathogenicity strains infected in both anatomic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with Helicobacter pylori can be considered a risk factor for developing gastric cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
