<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluated p53, cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 immunoexpressions in esophagogastric junction <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and to compared to clinicopathological characteristics and survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue sections from 75 esophagogastric junction <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> resected from 1991 to 2003 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for p53, cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 using streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-peroxidase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 60 months SD = 61.5 (varying from 4 to 273 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty (66.7%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were intestinal type and 25 (33.3%) were diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular, lymph node and perineural infiltration were verified in 16%, 80% and 68% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were distributed according to the TNM staging in IA in 4 (5.3%), IB in 10 (13.3%), II in 15 (20%), IIA in 15 (20%), IIIB in 15 (20%) and IV in 16 (21.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis was positive for p53, cyclin D1 and bcl-2 in 68%, 18.7% and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between immunoexpression and vascular and/or perineural invasions, clinicopathological characteristics and patients' survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this selected population, there was no association between the immunomarkers, p53, cyclin D1 and bcl-2 and clinicopathological data and/or overall survival </plain></SENT>
