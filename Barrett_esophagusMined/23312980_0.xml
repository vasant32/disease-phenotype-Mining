<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Surveillance endoscopy has been recommended for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; however, recent studies have questioned the importance owing to the new, lower, estimates of the rate of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, survival, and frequency of esophageal preservation in patients who presented with progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> within a surveillance program versus those who presented with prevalent disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> from 2005 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surveillance group included patients who had had at least 1 endoscopy and biopsy confirming <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (with or without low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) 6 months or more before the endoscopy showing progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 224 patients were included in the present study, 36 in the surveillance group and 188 in the prevalence group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surveillance patients had significantly earlier stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P &lt; .0001) and were more likely to undergo endoscopic therapy and to keep their esophagus (44% vs 11%, P &lt; .0001) than were patients with prevalent disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the patients in the surveillance group were less likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> and had better overall and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or an intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients within a surveillance program for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had better survival and were less likely to have an esophagectomy than those who presented with prevalent disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was curative, and improved survival with surveillance was not secondary to lead time bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surveillance endoscopy remains important in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
