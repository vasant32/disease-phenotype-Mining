<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo> secondary to the ingestion of caustic products is frequent in Brazil, mainly due to an attempt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is consequence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The literature consulted showed that are a rare association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASUISTIC AND METHODS: From 1981 to 2000 were admitted and treated in the "Gastrocentro" State University of Campinas, SP, Brazil, 120 patients presenting caustic stenosis of the esophagus, and during the follow-up were found nine cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> associated (7,5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time of caustic ingestion varied from 4 years to 54 years (mean 29 years), and they were four males and five females, eight whites and one black, with the mean age of 57,7 years (43 to 72 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cases presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and the flexible upper endoscopy showed stenotic areas and caustic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> sequels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients referred symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> were found in only one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was found in the middle third of the esophagus above the stenotic areas in three cases, and in the distal third in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was treated with periodic esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients presenting severe symptoms of reflux were submitted to modified Nissen fundoplication by videolaparoscopy, with good results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in these patients could be associated to the caustic ingestion, because it is not situated in the distal third of the esophagus, as commonly found in reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Its is very important the follow-up and biopsies of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, due to the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
