<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such studies are necessary in order to understand the overall risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> experienced by patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 502 patients with BE were identified at Leeds General Infirmary, England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mortality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence information were provided by the Office for National Statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated using indirect standardization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality was found to be elevated in patients with BE [SMR, 1.21; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.06, 1.37] and remained so after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> were excluded (SMR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased mortality risks were also found for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of the esophagus (SMR, 7.26; 95% CI, 3.87-12.42) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diseases of the digestive system</z:e> (SMR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.11-3.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining disease categories produced no altered risk estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Circulatory disease mortality was borderline statistically significant (SMR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-1.52; P = 0.053) for those with a specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence analyses, esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (SIR, 8.66; 95% CI, 4.73-14.53) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (SIR, 14.29; 95% CI, 7.13-22.56) were found to be increased in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> remaining analyses provided unaltered risks, including that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown evidence of an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It has also shown that those who have a histologic BE diagnosis may also have an increased risk of circulatory disease mortality </plain></SENT>
