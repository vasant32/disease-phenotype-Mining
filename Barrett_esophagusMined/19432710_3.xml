<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to review the oesophagectomy experience of a single surgeon with a moderate caseload who uses neoadjuvant therapy selectively and performs a conservative lymphadenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included 125 consecutive attempted oesophageal resections performed by a single surgeon (RC) from 1993 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were staged with computed tomography and also laparoscopy for lower third and junctional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic ultrasound was used in 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven per cent were <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neoadjuvant therapy was used selectively in 23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-one resections were carried out, giving an overall resection rate of 97% with an R0 resection in 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was 0.8%, clinical anastomotic leak 1.7% and median length of stay 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall median and 5-year survival were 46 months and 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stage-specific 5-year survival was 100%, 71%, 41% and 21% for stages 0, I, II and III, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Isolated local recurrence occurred in 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A moderate volume surgeon with specialist training in oesophageal resectional surgery can achieve a low mortality and anastomotic leak rate with good survival outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The role for neoadjuvant therapy and radical lymphadenectomy is controversial and remains to be clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Accurate preoperative staging is essential for selection of patients for curative surgery with or without neoadjuvant therapy and for comparison of results </plain></SENT>
