<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, we have demonstrated that loss of MnSOD resulted in severe esophageal damage by both endogenous and exogenous bile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the alterative manner of MnSOD in esophageal epithelium is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the expression and localization of MnSOD in response to the exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> in an esophageal epithelial cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Het-1A cells were seeded at 5 x 10(5) and 10(7) and incubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36257">taurocholate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29747">cholate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29746">glycocholate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23614">deoxycholate</z:chebi>, and the mixture of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mitochondria and cytoplasma were separated, and the expression and localization of MnSOD was determined by Western blot and immunocytochemical assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation rates were strongly inhibited in the groups with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36257">taurocholate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> mixture at 4 h, with 0.367 +/- 0.042 and 0.396 +/- 0.046, respectively, compared to 0.684 +/- 0.054 in untreated groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increased apoptotic rate compared to untreated group (3.65 +/- 0.59) were significantly increased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36257">taurocholate</z:chebi> group and in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> mixture group were 33.62 +/- 10.25 and 31.52 +/- 8.97 at 4 h, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protein level of MnSOD in mitochondria was increased at 4 h, but with a decreased enzymatic activity after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic MnSOD was detected in the cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated that esophageal epithelial cell underwent morphological alteration and MnSOD relocalization after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to demonstrate cellular cytosolic MnSOD expression and that this relocalization to the cytosol is a cause for decreased MnSOD enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> may contribute to the dysfunction of mitochondria, by enzymatically inhibiting of MnSOD localization and thus activation in the mitochondria </plain></SENT>
