<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy is an attractive technique for mucosal ablation in patients with superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the esophagus, or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early stage <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although illumination with green light is assumed to be safe, choice of the light has been empirical in clinical studies; light dose is often reduced to avoid potential complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed the safety of green and blue lights during photodynamic therapy in the esophagus by progressively administrating increasing doses in an attempt to standardize the dose and determine a safe upper limit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This would considerably simplify photodynamic therapy and improve therapeutic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sheep model was chosen because of similarities with humans regarding the thickness and histologic structure of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Irradiation with a 180 degrees windowed cylindrical light distributor was performed in 19 sheep 4 days after injection of 0.15 mg/kg of tetra(m-hydroxyphenyl) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36303">chlorin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Light doses ranged from 10 to 500 J/cm(2) at 514 nm (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> ion laser) and from 5 to 250 J/cm(2) at 413 nm (<z:chebi fb="25" ids="49696">krypton</z:chebi> laser) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up endoscopies revealed a tissue response with a fibrinous area at almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> light doses, whereas application of extremely high light doses tended to induce circumferential <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with subsequent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three months after irradiation with green light, histologic examination of the resected specimens revealed transmural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> at doses higher than 100 J/cm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After illumination with blue light, partial or more extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of the muscular layer was observed only at light doses of 175 to 250 J/cm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Application of high doses of green light after sensitization with tetra(m-hydroxyphenyl) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36303">chlorin</z:chebi> led to severe complications in the esophagus of the sheep that are highly likely to occur in humans as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Blue light causes significantly less damage than green light and may, therefore, be considered as an alternative for photodynamic therapy of early stage superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
