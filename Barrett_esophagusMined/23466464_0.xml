<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether the insulin/IGF-1 pathway is involved in the sequential progression from metaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fasting serum levels of insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, IGF-1, insulin growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP1), and IGFBP3 were measured in 44 non-dysplastic, 9 low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), 12 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and 10 EAC subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue derived from BE cases using rabbit monoclonal antibodies to p-mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) and p-AKT, mouse monoclonal antibody to Ki-67, and rabbit polyclonal antibody to p-insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen of 44 (43.2%) BE, 5/9 (55%) LGD, 8/12 (66.7%) HGD and EAC 7/10 (70%) cases showed strong staining for p-IRS1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher proportion of HGD/EAC subjects showed p-IRS1 staining when compared with BE/LGD subjects, 63.6% vs. 41.5%, P&lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p-IRS1 immunostaining was moderately correlated with strong immunostaining of the downstream mediators p-AKT and p-mTOR (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.167 and 0.27 for p-IRS1/p-AKT and for p-IRS1/p-mTOR, respectively) and the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.20, P=0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, systemic levels of insulin, IGF-1, or IGF-2 were not associated with tissue immunostaining of p-IRS1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Activation of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway in BE may be associated with cellular proliferation and appears to have a role in the progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The activation of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway at the tissue level is likely complex and does not have a simple association with systemic measures of insulin or IGF-1 </plain></SENT>
