<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a condition in which the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by a columnar epithelium with malignant potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is accepted as the primary risk factor for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but only a small fraction of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify factors that increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this matched case-control study was to investigate possible clinical risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was based on 79 case patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and 180 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each case patient was matched to one control patient whose indication for endoscopy was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and one control patient who underwent endoscopy for other indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The case and control patients were matched for age, gender, and race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent endoscopy at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, between July 1992 and August 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On average, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> developed reflux symptoms at an earlier age than age- and gender-matched control patients and also had a longer duration of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications of reflux, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, stricture, and ulceration, were reported significantly more frequently in the group of case patients than either group of control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, duration of symptoms, and complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> may be markers of increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
