<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Allelic deletions of 17p and alterations of p53 including elevated p53 protein levels have been observed in many different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the presence of 17p allelic deletions and p53 protein overexpression in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, we have combined the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, multiparameter flow cytometry, and DNA content cell sorting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combined use of these methodologies permits the purification of aneuploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells for restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 17p allelic deletions and the evaluation of p53 protein expression by multiparameter flow cytometry in the same aneuploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 15 aneuploid populations and one tetraploid populations from 13 Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> for 17p allelic deletions and p53 protein overexpression to determine whether both of these alterations are involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 13 tumors (92%) had 17p allelic deletions, and 8 of 13 tumors (62%) had p53 protein overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 12 tumors (67%) with 17p allelic deletions also had p53 protein overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that both 17p allelic deletions and p53 protein overexpression are frequently involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
