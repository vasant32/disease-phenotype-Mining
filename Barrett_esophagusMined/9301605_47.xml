<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate early results with laparoscopic total esophagectomy for benign and malignant disease of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case series involving 9 patients with mean follow-up of 13 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: An advanced endoscopic surgery unit at a tertiary referral teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Between December 12, 1993, and December 1, 1996, 9 patients with a mean age of 61 years underwent laparoscopic esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications were <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 5, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> in 1, dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> in 2, and refractory stricture with severe shortening in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Gastroduodenal mobilization, transhiatal wide esophageal dissection, gastric tube formation (8 cases), pyloromyotomy (2 cases), cervical anastomosis (8 cases), and laparoscopic jejunal feeding tube placement (8 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: Operative time, amount of blood loss, operative complications, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> rates, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were completed endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Operative time was 6.5 hours (range, 4 3/4 to 9 1/4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average blood loss was 290 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient required a right thoracoscopy for an intrathoracic anastomosis because of questionable viability of the gastric tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean hospital stay was 6.4 days (range, 4-9 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hospital complications included subclavian vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (1 patient), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001618'>dysphonia</z:hpo> (6 patients), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100750'>atelectasis</z:hpo> (5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no anastomotic leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three patients subsequently died: 2 of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> (at 13 months and 33 months) and 1 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> at 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The 6 surviving patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> free at a mean follow-up of 13 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One patient had left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001605'>vocal cord paralysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were doing well and had Visick scores of I or II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic esophagectomy is a technically feasible but difficult procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Despite the long operative times, patients do well and benefit from a shorter hospital stay and more rapid recovery compared with open esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Its role as a curative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> procedure remains unknown, but it may have a place on the basis of its palliative superiority </plain></SENT>
