<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: There is a view that the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are from causes other than esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this analysis was to establish the pattern of mortality for a number of causes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-center prospective cohort study of patients from Rotherham District General Hospital, which is a secondary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cohort consisted of 1239 patients who were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> between April 1978 and March 2009.  Follow-up for mortality was undertaken by "flagging" the patients with the NHS Information Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were compared with UK Office of National Statistics age- and sex-specific mortality data for 1999, the median year of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by a "person - years at risk" calculation from date of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ratio of observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from EAC compared with those expected in this cohort was 25.02 - a very large excess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or circulatory disease and there were fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1707251" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers other</z:e> than esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> compared with national statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a small statistically significant difference in mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes but this disappeared completely when <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is increased significantly but only as a result of the large excess of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This strengthens the case for endoscopic surveillance if successful interventions can be undertaken in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to prevent development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
