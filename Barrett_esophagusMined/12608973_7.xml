<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study was carried out on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who presented between 1993 and 2001 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early adeno-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> who were considered fit for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Details of endoscopic biopsies, appearance, surveillance, operative pathology and outcome were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 18 patients, one had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, six had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 11 had early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No patient had their biopsy diagnosis down-staged following final pathology, but two patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy were upstaged to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from disease occurred in a 39-year-old man who had undergone yearly surveillance for 86 months until <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oesophagectomy for early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> can be done with acceptable rates of mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surveillance until <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is confirmed does not guarantee curable disease </plain></SENT>
