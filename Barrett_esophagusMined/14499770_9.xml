<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> recurs after complete laser ablation and to evaluate the persistence of colon epithelial protein in esophageal mucosa after laser ablation as a predictor of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 31 patients with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) underwent laser photoablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Investigators without knowledge of treatment status evaluated serial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained slides, Alcian blue-stained slides, and immunohistochemistry for the detection of colon epithelial protein (mAb Das-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopic ablation of specialized intestinal epithelium was accomplished in 21 patients after 6.5 +/- 1.2 laser sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications included one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">UGI bleed</z:e> and one stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of eight post-laser recurrences, seven were successfully re-ablated; one developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> requiring esophageal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardia-type mucosa was present by biopsy at the time of complete ablation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight recurrent cases despite a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endoscopic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colon epithelial protein was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 31 patients before ablation, six of 21 completely ablated patients before they recurred and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only two of 15 patients, colon epithelial protein negative at the time of complete ablation, developed recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, cardia-type mucosa and persistent colon epithelial protein staining after complete ablation of specialized intestinal epithelium were predictors of future recurrence (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Specialized intestinal epithelium was ablated by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="33372">neodymium</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="28984">aluminum</z:chebi>-garnet laser but recurred in eight of 21 (38%) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Colon epithelial protein was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> primary (31 of 31) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recurrent (eight of eight) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrent specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> may be deep to squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Replacement of specialized intestinal mucosa by cardia-type mucosa and persistence of colonic epithelial protein are predictors of recurrent specialized intestinal mucosa before its endoscopic or histological detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Laser ablation of Barrett's epithelium is an investigational intervention that should be restricted to research protocols </plain></SENT>
