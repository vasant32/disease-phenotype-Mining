<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the theories that underlie the clinical decision to perform endoscopy in patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physicians reported that they use endoscopic findings to modify medical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to test this hypothesis in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consortium of community specialists in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> was formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physicians completed a database on patients undergoing elective endoscopy for symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, which includes symptom severity, endoscopic findings, and medical treatment before and after endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increase in medical treatment was defined as an increase in acid suppression therapy, and/or the addition of a promotility drug, and/or referral for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were collected prospectively over 6 months on 664 patients with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, and complete data were available on 598 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>, or ulceration) was present in 374 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 74% had an increase in therapy after endoscopy; for only 5% did therapy decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, among 224 patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing esophagus, 35% had an increase in treatment and 65% had either a decrease in treatment or no change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the increase in treatment was due to persistence of symptoms or because of endoscopic findings in the stomach or duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The differences in treatment changes between the two groups was highly significant (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results support the theory that physicians often use endoscopic results to tailor medical therapy in patients with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
