<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize those pediatric patients who receive long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) and to determine the safety of long-term use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Patient databases were screened for long-term <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use, defined as more than 9 months of continuous prescription, between 1989 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median duration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use in the 166 patients in the study group was 3 years (range, 0.75 to 11.25 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 80 patients used <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> for 3 to 11 years duration; 35 of these for more than 5 years, and 15 for more than 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age at initial prescription was 7.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At least 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>)-predisposing disorder was present in 79% of the patients; the major disorders were neuromotor (in 66%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> (in 14.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-predisposing disorder was present in 35 patients (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> in 39% and histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 4.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">Omeprazole</z:chebi> was used in 90% of the patients; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi>, in 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six adverse reactions seen in 4 patients were potentially related to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Children with underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-predisposing disorders compose the majority of long-term <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Few adverse reactions to these drugs occur, and discontinuation of the drug is seldom indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These preliminary data suggest that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> may be efficacious and safe for continuous use for up to 11 years' duration in children </plain></SENT>
