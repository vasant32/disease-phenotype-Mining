<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients with BE were evaluated with a prototype, high-resolution videoendoscope that has separate charge-coupled devices for white light endoscopy (WLE) and autofluorescence imaging (AFI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nondysplastic BE appears green on AFI, whereas potentially neoplastic areas appear blue/violet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BE was first screened with WLE for visible abnormalities and then was examined by AFI to detect additional lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions that raised a suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and control areas that were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on AFI were sampled for histopathologic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, random 4-quadrant biopsy specimens were obtained at 2-cm intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A diagnosis of HGD/EC was made in 22 patients; one patient had no visible abnormality, and 21 had endoscopically detectable areas with HGD/EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 6 of the latter 21 patients, the HGD/EC was detected with AFI alone; in another patient, HGD/EC was detected with AFI and random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients, HGD/EC was detected with both WLE and AFI; in 3 of these 14 patients, additional lesions containing HGD/EC were detected by AFI alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that video AFI may improve the detection of HGD/EC in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
