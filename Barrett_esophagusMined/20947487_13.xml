<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We obtained molecular data from a cohort of 239 participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, including microsatellite shifts and loss of heterozygosity, DNA content tetraploidy and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, methylation, and sequence mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using these data, we tested <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major diversity measurement methods, including genetic divergence and entropy-based measures, to determine which measures are correlated with risk of progression to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also tested whether the use of different sets of loci and alterations to define clones (e.g., selectively advantageous versus evolutionarily neutral) improved the predictive value of the diversity indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> diversity measures were strong and highly significant predictors of progression (Cox proportional hazards model, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The type of alterations evaluated had little effect on the predictive value of most of the diversity measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, diversity measures are robust predictors of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in this cohort </plain></SENT>
