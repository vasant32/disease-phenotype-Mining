<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that epithelial changes induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> are related to the pH environment of the esophageal lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the various types of esophageal epithelium are associated with specific pH environments that induce their formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> pH environment to the histology of the distal esophageal epithelium in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 197 symptomatic patients with increased esophageal acid exposure on 24-hour pH monitoring were grouped according to the histology based on biopsies from the distal esophagus: 17 with squamous epithelium, 126 with cardiac epithelium (CE), and 54 with Barrett's epithelium (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> and monitored off acid suppression therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acid exposure was expressed as the percent of time the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> pH was at intervals of 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, and 6-7 over a 24-hour period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE spent significantly more time at pH intervals 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5 than those with CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This pattern switched at pH interval 5-6, where patients with cardiac mucosa spent more time than those with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with squamous and CE had similar pH exposure at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE have significantly longer exposure time at the pH interval of 2 to 5 compared to those with cardiac and squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the exposure of stem cells to a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> pH between 2 and 5 may trigger the differentiation of CE into intestinalized CE </plain></SENT>
