<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 50 patients (32 male, 18 female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two biopsy specimens were taken from the antrum, at least 2 cm away from the pylorus, from the incisura angularis, corpus and cardia and four biopsy specimens were taken from tongue-like columnar protrusions (&lt;3 cm long) above the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples were stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51686">hematoxyline</z:chebi>-eosine, HID-Alcian blue pH 2.5 and modified Giemsa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 50 subjects who were found to have tongue-like columnar protrusions above the gastroesophageal junction, short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was detected in nine (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> short segment Barretti's esophagus cases were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005231'>chronic gastritis</z:hpo>, Helicobacter pylori was found to be positive in five (55.5%) of them and there was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in other parts of the stomach (antrum in two patients, incisura angularis in three, antrum and cardia in one) in six (66.6%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 41 patients without short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> 33 (80%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005231'>chronic gastritis</z:hpo>, 27 (66%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> and eight had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in different locations (there in antrum, four in incisura angularis, one in the antrum and cardia) of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An association between short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was found in different parts of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The link between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the stomach and these metaplastic changes in the tubular esophagus requires evalation in larger and more comprehensive studies </plain></SENT>
