<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: The surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> is indicated in patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> condition when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> therapy is ineffective or when symptoms are persistently recurrent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fundoplication failure occurrence has been detected in some patients and highlights a needing of monitoring esophageal post-surgical condition since that clinical symptoms are not sensitive enough for indicating fundoplication failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To identify the frequency of a disrupted wrap in the postoperative period and to evaluate esophageal complications related with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> recurrence in children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was cross-sectional, prospective and descriptive, including 45 patients (16 months-16.9 years) who had undergone Nissen fundoplication in a school hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty six patients (57.8%) were neurologically impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in order to determine fundoplication integrity, endoscopic and histopathological esophageal condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed from 12 up to 30 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patent wrap was identified in 41 patients (91.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recurrent peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was found in 6 of 45 patients, 2 of which required a second fundoplication and other two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was associated with a defective wrap (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions - Fundoplication was effective for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, even in patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic follow up may detect surgery failure in children undergone anti-reflux surgery even in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
