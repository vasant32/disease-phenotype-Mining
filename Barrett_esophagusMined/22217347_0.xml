<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aims: we investigated: a) the gene/proteins alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> using immunohistochemistry (IHC) (gene overexpression) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) (gene amplification); and b) the associations between EGFR overexpression and amplification and chromosome 7 aneusomy (CEP7) in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 64 tumor specimens were evaluated by IHC and FISH: 17 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in BarrettÂ´s esophagus, 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>stomach cancers</z:hpo>, 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo>, and 9 liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IHC for EGFR was scored at 4 levels of intensity of membrane staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EGFR gene in FISH was considered as amplified or not and chromosome 7 (where EGFR is located) as polysomic or disomic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio between EGFR gene and chromosome 7 was performed by FISH and classified the case as gene amplification when the ratio was &gt; 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polisomy was identified when the copies of chromosome 7 were &gt; 2 in more than 8% malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: no difference was found between EGFR gene amplification/protein overexpression according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concerning IHC, most cases were positive for EGFR intensity (84.4%), while only 50% of cases were positive considering a cut-off of 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EGFR FISH amplification was found in 4 cases only (6.2%) and FISH CEP7aneusomy in 40.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant association was found between EGFR protein positivity (IHC) in term of intensity and EGFR gene amplification by FISH (p = 0.003), and between the EGFR protein positivity (IHC) and chromosome 7 aneusomy (FISH) (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EGFR amplification assessed by FISH was found in only 4 cases (6.2%) while chromosome 7 aneusomy was identified in 26 (40.6%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IHC proved that EGFR protein overexpression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> is common but FISH assessment showed that EGFR gene amplification is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An association was observed between EGFR gene amplification and EGFR protein overexpression in a low number of cases (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant association was found between EGFR protein overexpression and chromosome 7 polysomy (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
