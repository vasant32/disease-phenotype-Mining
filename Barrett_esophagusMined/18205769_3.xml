<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), a known precursor, has a high prevalence but only few patients with this condition progress to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>--surveillance and screening programs are controversial and lack proven efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective analysis reviews the 13-year outcome for patients entered into a surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from patients with histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (1992-2003) that participated in a surveillance program were identified and analyzed retrospectively until 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 404/536 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> confirmed histologically of which 212 (53%) were followed in a surveillance program (mean 3.95 years per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This resulted in 749 gastroscopies (3.5/patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologically, Barrett's mucosa was seen in 54%, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 18%, ulcerations in 9%, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was seen in 13%, no biopsy was obtained in 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine of 212 patients (4.3%) under surveillance developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>; two presented with symptoms, requiring gastroscopy outside the surveillance program (1/2 was operated successfully, one had advanced disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In seven asymptomatic patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was detected on routine endoscopy; curative esophagectomy was performed in six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were male and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or ulcerations on index endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: During 13 years of Barrett's surveillance, 88% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> occurred in a subset of only 11% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To stratify surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, programs could focus on male patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or ulcerations on index endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the cost-effectiveness of this remains unproven </plain></SENT>
