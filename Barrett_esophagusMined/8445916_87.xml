<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although endoscopic surveillance of these patients is commonly practiced, its benefits have not been proved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to examine the effect of endoscopic surveillance on the stage of resected <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and the effect on postoperative survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between 1973 and 1991, 77 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were seen by us, and 19 of them were under endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 19 patients underwent endoscopic biopsies at 1-month to 4-year intervals (median 6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient underwent esophagogastrectomy when severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stages of the resected <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> in the group under surveillance compared with the group not under surveillance were significantly different, 58% of the patients under surveillance having stages 0 and I disease and 21% having stage III disease compared with 17% of the patients not under surveillance having stages 0 and I disease and 47% having stage III disease (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year actuarial survival of patients undergoing routine surveillance was 62% and of patients not under surveillance, 20% (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance of patients with benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> permits detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at an early stage and improves long-term survival after resection for severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
