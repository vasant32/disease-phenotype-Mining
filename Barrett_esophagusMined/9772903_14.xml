<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, numeric changes affecting chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, X, and Y were analyzed by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome-specific centromere DNA probes in 12 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, TP53 overexpression, measured by immunohistochemistry, and amplification of HER-2/neu and C-MYC, detected by FISH, were analyzed within the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common numeric abnormalities detected were gains of chromosomes 12 (8 cases), 6 (7 cases), 7 (7 cases), and 11 (6 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total number of abnormal chromosomes varied from 0 to 10, with an average of 4.6 per case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of TP53 was present in 9 of 12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation was noted between the degree of aneusomy and TP53 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, HER-2/neu amplification was present in two cases, both with large numbers of aneusomic chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Amplification of C-MYC was detected in only one case that had a moderate number of numeric abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a subset of cases in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> were examined, aneusomy was found to be an early change, frequently present in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and dysplastic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, gene amplification and TP53 overexpression were restricted to more advanced areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Screening larger cohorts of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> for numeric abnormalities of chromosomes 6, 7, 11, and 12 may determine whether any of these abnormalities are predictive markers of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
