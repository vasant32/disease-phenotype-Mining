<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be especially true for reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002163'>glandular dysplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine exactly which histologic procedures are used by experts in gastrointestinal pathology, a checklist survey was mailed to 50 members of the Gastrointestinal Pathology Society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responses were received from 42 (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Formalin, used 80% of the time, is overwhelmingly the most popular <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Orientation of biopsy material before further processing is performed in 36% of the institutions, most often (53%) by an endoscopy technician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently used (60%) substrate for orientation is filter material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common (83%) routine procedure uses only H&amp;E staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Others routinely add a mucin reaction to the H&amp;E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven different practices for sectioning are used; the most common (43%) is serial step sectioning at 3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One third of the responders had a formal surveillance program for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For esophageal biopsy specimens, a broad spectrum of histologic practices exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Trends for the more complex histotechnologic procedures to be used by those involved in screening for dysplastic Barrett's epithelium are evident </plain></SENT>
