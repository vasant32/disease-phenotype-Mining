<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective study, which summarized our clinical experience with various miniprobe techniques in the assessment of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) and superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> on Barrett's mucosa (SAB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 106 superficial and naive esophageal lesions were included in this series (52 SAB, 54 <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the miniprobe staging were compared with pathology in order to determine the accuracy of this technique in differentiating mucosal from submucosal infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary aims were a comparison between the frequencies (20- vs. 30-MHz) and coupling methods (water-filled lumen vs. balloon-sheathed catheter) used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to differentiate T1sm from T1 m <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were 73.5 %, 62 %, and 76.5 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overdiagnosis occurred in 18.6 % of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found in the accuracy of the miniprobe staging between the two lesion types (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> and SAB) ( P = 0.65), and results were significantly poorer in the distal part of the esophagus ( P = 0.00039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between the two frequencies ( P = 0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Water-filled lumen proved to be superior to the balloon-sheathed catheter ( P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-frequency miniprobe examination has a limited accuracy in the detection of submucosal invasion in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further improvements in acoustic coupling and ultrasound technique are required to improve the miniprobe accuracy before its implementation into clinical routine </plain></SENT>
