<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Widespread implementation of rigorous, systematic endoscopic biopsy protocols for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may be hindered by concerns about their safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes the safety experience of a large series of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who underwent such procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients in the Seattle <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> Project undergo biopsy surveillance in a research-based clinical setting, using large channel endoscopes and "jumbo" biopsy forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After visual inspection, multiple biopsies are obtained from lesions and at 1- to 2-cm intervals throughout the Barrett's esophageal segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1983 to 1997, 1,458 consecutive endoscopies were performed on 705 patients and 50,833 biopsies (average, 35; maximum, 120 per procedure) were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedures lasted from 15 to 90 min during which one to two biopsies were obtained per minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients experienced 18 significant adverse events, five of which led to overnight hospitalizations: two for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> attributed to concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> dilation; two for cardiac dysrhythmias; and one for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Events managed in outpatient settings included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> during seven endoscopies (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> accounted for by two patients), chest or epigastric pain developing after five endoscopies, and one tonsillar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients recovered completely, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, or esophageal stricturing resulted from the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A rigorous, systematic endoscopic biopsy protocol in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> does not produce esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> when performed by an experienced team of physicians, nurses, and technicians </plain></SENT>
