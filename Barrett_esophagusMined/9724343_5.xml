<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most cases are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1567741" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Alport syndrome</z:e> and have partial deletions in the genes encoding both the alpha5 and alpha6 chains of collagen type IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied aspects of cell-matrix interaction of myocytes in an esophagogastrectomy specimen from a 12-year-old patient with DL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myocytes had central areas of cytoplasmic rarefaction, which were actin positive and desmin poor, with the reverse pattern of staining at the cell periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy (EM) showed that the areas of rarefaction consisted of disorganized aggregates of filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The basement membranes ranged from thickened to thinned or absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for the alpha1-alpha4 chains of collagen type IV, the alpha1, alpha2, beta2, and gamma1 chains of laminin, nidogen, type VI collagen, and fibronectin was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was loss of the alpha5 and alpha6 chains of collagen type IV and the beta1 chain of laminin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> staining for alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha4, alpha6, alpha8, and beta1 integrins was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Staining for alpha5 integrin varied from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to reduced or negative in different cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In DL, a primary abnormality of basement membrane may be associated with disorganization of the contractile apparatus and alterations of certain integrins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may reflect a disturbance of cell-matrix interactions that play a role in cell differentiation and internal organization </plain></SENT>
