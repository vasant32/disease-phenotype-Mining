<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lower esophageal sphincter, esophageal acid and acid/alkaline exposure, and the presence of excessive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> (DGR) was evaluated in 205 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and various degrees of mucosal injury (no mucosal injury, n = 92; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, n = 66; stricture, n = 19; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Manometry and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring showed that the prevalence and severity of esophageal mucosal injury was higher in patients with a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter (p less than 0.01) or increased esophageal acid/alkaline exposure (p less than 0.01) as compared with those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sphincter or only increased esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were particularly frequent and severe in patients who had a combination of a defective sphincter and increased esophageal acid/alkaline exposure (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combined esophageal and gastric pH monitoring showed that esophageal alkaline exposure was increased only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with DGR (p less than 0.05) and that DGR was more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with a stricture or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter and reflux of acid gastric juice contaminated with duodenal contents therefore appear to be the most important determinants for the development of mucosal injury in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This explains why some patients fail medical therapy and supports the surgical reconstruction of the defective sphincter as the most effective therapy </plain></SENT>
