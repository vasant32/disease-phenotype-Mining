<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent to which confirmatory endoscopy alters management and detects missed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in newly diagnosed BE has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency with which confirmatory endoscopy changed surveillance management in patients with newly diagnosed BE was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A two center cohort analysis was conducted on patients newly diagnosed with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on confirmatory endoscopy for patients who had nondysplastic BE was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic and endoscopic variables were assessed for association with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection using Firth logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of the 146 patients newly diagnosed with BE and initially determined to be without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 12 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on the confirmatory second EGD (8.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 12 cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on confirmatory endoscopy had long-segment BE (LSBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the LSBE cases in our cohort, 11 had newly diagnosed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on confirmatory EGD, 29.7% (11/37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average number of biopsies obtained from the 11 LSBE cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was comparable with the rest of the LSBE cases without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (6.73 and 5.42, respectively, P-value 0.205) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection in short-segment BE (SSBE) was much lower, 0.95% (1 out of 105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detected in any SSBE case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HGD was detected on confirmatory EGD in two cases, both were LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Segment length was the only statistically significant factor to predict the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on confirmatory endoscopy (odds ratio 9.158, P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Confirmatory EGD in newly diagnosed LSBE had significant rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection (29.7%) in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Among patients with SSBE, there was a low rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection with confirmatory EGD, less than 1% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No additional cases of HGD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> in SSBE cases were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the yield of confirmatory EGD is greater in patients with LSBE </plain></SENT>
