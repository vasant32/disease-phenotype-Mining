<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study determined the prevalence and demographic features of patients with SIM, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the esophagus and EGJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two antegrade biopsy specimens were taken distal to the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) and any tongues of pink mucosa proximal to the SCJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized endoscopically and histologically as having long-segment (LSBE) or short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE), EGJ-SIM, or a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EGJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 889 patients studied, 56 were undergoing esophagoduodenoscopy screening or surveillance and were not included in the prevalence calculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of SIM was 13.2%, with 1.6% LSBE, 6.0% SSBE, and 5.6% EGJ-SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was noted in 31% of LSBE, 10% of SSBE, and 6.4% of EGJ-SIM patients (P &lt;/= 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were associated with LSBE, 1 with SSBE, and 1 with EGJ-SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with LSBE and SSBE were predominantly white (P &lt;/= 0.001), male (P &lt;/= 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>009), and smokers (P &lt;/= 0.004), with LSBE patients having a longer history of heartburn (P &lt;/= 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with EGJ-SIM were similar in gender and ethnicity to the reference group, tended to be older (P &lt;/= 0.05), drank less alcohol (P &lt;/= 0.02), and had a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> (P &lt;/= 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SSBE and EGJ-SIM is similar, but each entity is 3.5 times more prevalent than LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in LSBE is 2 times greater than in SSBE and 4 times greater than in EGJ-SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Demographically, EGJ-SIM patients are different from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and have a higher prevalence of H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These data help to explain the increasing incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal esophagus and EGJ </plain></SENT>
