<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of unsuspected early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and to evaluate surgical outcome in a cohort of patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was found in six (38%) resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient (6%) died 3 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients are alive without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458156" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent cancer</z:e> (range of follow-up, 2-68 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative complications occurred in seven patients (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Late complications occurred in 11 patients (73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic strictures accounted for seven of the 11 (64%) late complications </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mortality associated with esophagectomy is low, and perioperative complications can usually be managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Esophageal resection is indicated in appropriately selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
