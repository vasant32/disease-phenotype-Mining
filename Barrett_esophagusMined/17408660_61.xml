<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Critical information regarding overall survival of patients followed up long-term after these therapies is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the long-term survival of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> with patients treated with esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed records of patients with HGD seen at our institution between 1994 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was performed 48 hours following the intravenous administration of a photosensitizer using light at 630 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy was performed by either transhiatal or transthoracic approaches by experienced surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We excluded <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> on biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vital status and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> date information was queried using an institutionally approved Internet research and location service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 199 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 129 patients (65%) were treated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and 70 (35%) with esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> group was 9% (11/129) and in the surgery group was 8.5% (6/70) over a median follow-up period of 59 +/- 2.7 months for the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> group and 61 +/- 5.8 months for the surgery group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was similar between the 2 groups (Wilcoxon test = 0.0924; P = .76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment modality was not a significant predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall mortality and long-term survival in patients with HGD treated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> appears to be comparable to that of patients treated with esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
