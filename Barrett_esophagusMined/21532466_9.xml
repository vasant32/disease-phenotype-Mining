<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Esophagectomy has previously been the gold standard for patients with mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, BC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the minimal invasiveness and excellent results obtained with endoscopic resection (ER), the latter has become an accepted alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, few data have so far been published comparing the 2 treatment methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 114 patients with mucosal BC who were treated surgically or endoscopically in 2 high-volume centers were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between 1996 and 2009, 38 patients with mucosal BC received transthoracic esophageal resection with 2-field lymphadenectomy (median 29 lymph nodes removed; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pN0) in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cologne </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six patients with BC treated with ER followed by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi>-plasma-coagulation of the remaining non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in the Department of Gastroenterology in Wiesbaden were matched according to the following criteria: age, gender, infiltration depth (pT1m1-3), differentiation grade (G1/2 vs. 3) and follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to epidemiologic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the surgery group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 patient in the ER group (98.7%; the patient died of other causes before CR was achieved) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major complications after surgery occurred in 32% of the patients, significantly more often than in the ER group (0% major complications, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 90-day mortality rates were 0% in the ER group and 2.6% in the surgical group (1 of 38; P = 0.333) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up periods were 4.1 years in the ER group and 3.7 years in the surgical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During this period, 1 patient in the ER group had a local recurrence and 4 had metachronous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (overall recurrence rate 6.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, repeat endoscopic treatment was possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients, and the long-term CR rates in the surgical and ER groups were 100% and 98.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related mortality was observed in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients with mucosal BC, both surgery and ER are effective treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Surgery is associated with a higher morbidity rate and shows a risk for procedure-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, the recurrence rate is higher in patients treated with ER, so that thorough follow-up procedures are mandatory </plain></SENT>
