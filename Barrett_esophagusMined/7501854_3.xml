<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT is usually performed to clarify findings seen with other imaging modalities or to stage a pathologic condition; however, it may be the primary imaging modality in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the critical location of the esophagus, it can be involved secondarily by other disease processes or as part of a systemic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By being aware of the appearances of the various entities that affect the esophagus, the radiologist can play an important role in detecting and staging <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the role of CT in the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> has been controversial, recent developments such as spiral CT have the potential to renew interest in this application </plain></SENT>
