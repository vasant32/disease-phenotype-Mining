<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the relationship between the clinical and histological features in a cohort of patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>-related lesions diagnosed after upper digestive endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 589 patients scheduled for elective endoscopy in a multicentric prospective study were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple biopsies from the distal esophagus showing aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or metaplastic epithelium were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>Esophagitis</z:hpo> was histologically detected in 25.6%, gastric-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 36.2%, and specialized columnar epithelium in 33.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was constant across age decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with specialized columnar epithelium were significantly older (P = 0.01) and had a greater extent of metaplastic epithelium (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specialized columnar epithelium was observed in 15% of patients with only distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was constant across age strata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of specialized columnar epithelium was associated with older age and with longer segments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Short areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> should be biopsied in view of their potential for holding areas of specialized columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
