<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Radiofrequency ablation can eradicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> successfully in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine (1) how often <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> is detected during follow-up endoscopy after successful ablation and (2) patterns of persistent/recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients ablated successfully during a phase II clinical trial of radiofrequency ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were followed using endoscopic surveillance according to a defined protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systematic biopsies were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients throughout the neosquamous epithelium as well as at the gastroesophageal junction, and patterns of recurrent or persistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were ablated successfully during this single-institution clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 151 follow-up endoscopies were performed (range, 1-5 endoscopies per patient) and 2492 biopsies were obtained, of which 604 (24%) were from the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 18 months (range, 3-50 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrent/persistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was detected in 14 patients (26%) in 3 distinct patterns: endoscopically invisible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> underneath the neosquamous epithelium (buried glands) in 3 patients, visible recurrence in the tubular esophagus in 3 patients, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastroesophageal junction (with a squamous-lined tubular esophagus) in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was not detected in any patient during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent/persistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> after successful radiofrequency ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is relatively common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding has implications for the continued surveillance of patients who are ablated successfully </plain></SENT>
