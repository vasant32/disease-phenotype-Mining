<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) can be treated effectively with medical therapy; however, in patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> who are unresponsive to medical therapy, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is often found to be mechanically incompetent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical therapy, which improves the LES antireflux barrier, may then be a good option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A very effective and popular antireflux procedure is the Nissen fundoplication, which can be safely done via the laparoscopic route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative evaluation should include contrast radiography, esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies, esophageal manometry, and 24-hour pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery include failure or inability to continue on medical therapy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-related respiratory symptoms, and severe complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, such as ulceration, stricture, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A short, loose Nissen fundoplication is ideal for patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal body motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operative complications are infrequent, and they include gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following the laparoscopic approach, nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients can leave the hospital on the first or second postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring show the same good long-term results as seen after open Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication can be performed safely and effectively with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the advantages of a minimally invasive approach </plain></SENT>
