<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: We have determined the p16 mutation spectrum for a cohort of 304 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> that predisposes to the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty seven mutations were detected by sequencing of p16 exon 2 in 44 BE patients (14.5%) with a mutation spectrum consistent with that caused by oxidative damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with p16 mutations increased with increasing histologic grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, samples from 3 out of 19 patients (15.8%) who underwent esophagectomy were found to have mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest the environment of the esophagus in BE patients can both generate and select for clones with p16 mutations </plain></SENT>
