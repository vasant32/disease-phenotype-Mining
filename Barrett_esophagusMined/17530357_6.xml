<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on our analysis of postoperative reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE) at Tokai University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 48 patients who underwent gastric tube reconstruction after esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of RE was confirmed by endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 48 patients, 28 (58.3%) were found to have RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 28 patients with RE, only four (14.3%) reported symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the severity of RE according to the Los Angeles classification in the patients was as follows: grade M, 1 (3.6%); grade A, 2 (7.1%); grade B, 6 (21.4%); grade C, 17 (60.7%); and grade D, 2 cases (7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Barrett's epithelium was detected in 9 of the 28 patients (31%) with RE and in 3 of the 20 (15%) patients with no evidence of RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To detect the presence of RE as well as monitor for recurrence and development of metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, we consider it important to perform endoscopy regularly over the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As Barrett's epithelium is frequently encountered, care should be exercised to detect the specialized columnar epithelium showing dysplastic changes </plain></SENT>
