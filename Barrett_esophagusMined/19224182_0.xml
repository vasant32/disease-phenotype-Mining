<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The operation data were as follows: 41 thoracoscopically assisted procedures, 41 intrathoracic anastomoses, conversion rate 0, 100% R0 resection rate, 25 (15-52) lymph node retrievals, leak rate 2, and one mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From these results we conclude that minimally invasive esophagectomy with high intrathoracic anastomosis is a safe procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The R0 resection rate, lymph node retrieval, and operating time are comparable with those of the open abdominothoracic approach </plain></SENT>
