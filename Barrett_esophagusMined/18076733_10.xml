<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Gastroenterologists' approach to surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that financial incentives and concerns over malpractice litigation influence gastroenterologists' usual practices regarding screening and surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We surveyed gastroenterologists (N = 224) regarding their usual practice of screening or surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, belief in the efficacy of screening, knowledge of published guidelines, demographic factors, compensation structure, volume of endoscopies, and malpractice history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Practices were characterized as aggressive or conservative in the utilization of services compared with a published guideline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one percent of attending gastroenterologists reported being identified as a defendant in at least one malpractice suit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior malpractice defendants had practiced gastroenterology longer and performed a higher volume of endoscopies, but had similar knowledge regarding published screening guidelines to those who had not been defendants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were more likely to be aggressive rather than conservative in screening and surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-12), and remained so after controlling for other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, they were more likely to recommend screening for populations with a lower risk of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and to perform more frequent surveillance for low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other factors were not associated with aggressive practice, including compensation structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: History of at least one prior malpractice suit appears to be associated with the more aggressive use of endoscopic screening and surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, irrespective of physician belief regarding the efficacy of that strategy in reducing mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235013" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Hypervigilance</z:e> and fear of future malpractice suits may drive this increased use </plain></SENT>
