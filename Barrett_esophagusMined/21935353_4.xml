<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Understanding how silent genes can be competent for activation provides insight into development as well as cellular reprogramming and pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed genomic location analysis of the pioneer transcription factor FoxA in the adult mouse liver and found that about one-third of the FoxA bound sites are near silent genes, including genes without detectable <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the FoxA-bound silent sites are within conserved sequences, suggesting possible function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such sites are enriched in motifs for transcriptional repressors, including for Rfx1 and type II nuclear hormone receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found one such target site at a cryptic "shadow" enhancer 7 kilobases (kb) downstream of the Cdx2 gene, where Rfx1 restricts transcriptional activation by FoxA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Cdx2 shadow enhancer exhibits a subset of regulatory properties of the upstream Cdx2 promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While Cdx2 is ectopically induced in the early metaplastic condition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, its expression is not necessarily present in progressive Barrett's with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, we find that Rfx1 expression in the esophageal epithelium becomes gradually extinguished during progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, i.e, expression of Rfx1 decreased markedly in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that this decreased expression of Rfx1 could be an indicator of progression from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and that similar analyses of other transcription factors bound to silent genes can reveal unanticipated regulatory insights into oncogenic progression and cellular reprogramming </plain></SENT>
