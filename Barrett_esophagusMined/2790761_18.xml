<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In five cases, the number of metaphases identified were insufficient for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining ten cases, nine contained clonal chromosome abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these nine cases, one demonstrated a structural chromosome rearrangement, t(3;6)(q21;p23); one case demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> for chromosomes 5 and 7; and seven cases demonstrated loss of the Y chromosome as a clonal change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is frequently characterized by clonal proliferation of karyotypically abnormal cells </plain></SENT>
