<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 98% surveyed patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at least biennially (76% thought this would improve survival and 49% believed it to be cost-effective) and 82% surveyed short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at least biennially (57% thought this would improve survival and 30% believed it to be cost-effective) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, 44% surveyed microscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at least biennially (26% thought this would improve survival and 11% believed it to be cost-effective) </plain></SENT>
