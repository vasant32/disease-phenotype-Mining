<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To report on a long-term follow-up and the factors that determine the recurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in a cohort of patients with non dysplastic, intestinal type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, after complete ablation of the metaplastic mucosa with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-six patients underwent endoscopic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation with adequate acid suppression obtained through a continuous <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> therapy (50 patients) or through laparoscopic fundoplication (46 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete ablation was achieved in 94 patients who underwent follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic and histological examinations were performed every 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up of the patients was 36 months (range 18-98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A recurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was found in 17 patients (18%), with an annual recurrence rate of 6.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, nor <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were found during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Through the use of logistic regression analysis, previous laparoscopic fundoplication was associated with a reduced recurrence rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (odds ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.10-0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The long-term recurrence of intestinal type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was low after complete ablation with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The control of oesophageal acidity acid exposure with laparoscopic fundoplication seems to reduce the recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
