<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> risk factors, such as age and the length of the esophageal BE segment, have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, improved molecular biomarkers predicting increased progression risk are needed for improved risk assessment and stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR, we screened 10 genes (HPP1, RUNX3, RIZ1, CRBP1, 3-OST-2, APC, TIMP3, p16, MGMT, p14) for promoter hypermethylation in 77 EAC, 93 BE, and 64 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (NE) specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subset of genes manifesting significant differences in methylation frequencies between BE and EAC was then analysed in 20 dysplastic specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 genes except p14 were frequently methylated in EACs, with RUNX3, HPP1, CRBP1, RIZ1, and OST-2 representing novel methylation targets in EAC and/or BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p16, RUNX3, and HPP1 displayed increasing methylation frequencies in BE vs EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these increases in methylation occurred early, at the interface between BE and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate the silencing effect of hypermethylation, we selected the EAC cells BIC1, in which the HPP1 promoter is natively methylated, and subjected them to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (Aza-C) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Real-time RT-PCR indicated increased HPP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels after 3 days of Aza-C treatment, as well as decreased levels of methylated HPP1 DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of a subset of six genes (APC, TIMP3, CRBP1, p16, RUNX3, and HPP1) was then tested in a retrospective longitudinal study of 99 BE and nine LGD specimens obtained from 53 BE patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or EAC were defined as progression end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patient groups were compared: eight progressors (P) and 45 nonprogressors (NP), using Cox proportional hazards models to determine the relative progression risks of age, BE segment length, and methylation events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses revealed that only hypermethylation of p16 (odds ratio (OR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-2.20), RUNX3 (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.08-2.81), and HPP1 (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.06-2.81) were independently associated with an increased risk of progression, whereas age, BE segment length, and hypermethylation of TIMP3, APC, or CRBP1 were not independent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In combined analyses, risk was detectable up to, but not earlier than, 2 years preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of p16, RUNX3, and HPP1 in BE or LGD may represent independent risk factors for the progression of BE to HGD or EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications regarding risk stratification, early EAC detection, and the appropriate endoscopic surveillance interval for patients with BE </plain></SENT>
