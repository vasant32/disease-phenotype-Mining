<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: At least half of the patients with typical reflux symptoms have non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Minimal change lesions are commonly seen in the screening endoscopic examinations for individuals without clinically significant symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the correlation between minimal changes and symptoms in individuals visiting the hospital for routine health check-up by a nationwide survey in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations as a health check-up were performed for 25,536 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, symptom questionnaires were given in 23,350 patients without mucosal break or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings of the lower esophagus were divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or minimal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minimal changes in the present study included white turbid discoloration and Z-line blurring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among a total of 25,536 subjects, reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was found in 2019 subjects (7.91%) and 3043 patients (11.9%) were classified as having minimal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) was more commonly found in individuals with minimal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the reflux-related symptoms, heartburn, acid regurgitation, globus sensation, and epigastric soreness were related to the minimal changes of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Especially, individuals with globus sensation or epigastric soreness were more likely to have minimal changes compared to individuals without respective symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Male gender, current smoker, history of H. pylori eradication, frequent stooping at work, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and atrophic/metaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> were found to be risk factors for minimal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The minimal changes were closely related with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal symptoms</z:e> and had similar risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, suggesting that minimal changes could be considered as early endoscopic findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
