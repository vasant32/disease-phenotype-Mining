<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> has decreased in the last few decades, although this decrease shows wide geographical variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> continues to be high in countries such as Chile, Colombia and Ireland and this disease remains the most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> in both sexes in China and Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the meeting of the American Gastroenterological Association, notable among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the studies presented on the prevention and treatment of esophageal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> were the following contributions: the use of clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) should be improved; treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> does not seem to reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>; endoscopic therapy of intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> through complete mucosal resection is effective; Helicobacter pylori eradication prevents the development of metachronous <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> in patients treated for a first intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> through endoscopic resection; the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> is 6 times higher in patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than in the general population; and photodynamic therapy may be an alternative for the treatment of "invisible" <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, which should be followed-up endoscopically </plain></SENT>
