<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective medical record analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, extraesophageal disease secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER), methods of GER diagnosis, acid suppression therapy before antireflux surgery, and response to surgical intervention were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The charts of 29 patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication surgery for EER were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>Hoarseness</z:hpo> was present in 17 patients; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1168250" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngopharyngeal reflux</z:e> (LPR) was the most common diagnosis (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">Barium</z:chebi> esophagram was done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and revealed abnormalities indicative of GER in 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour ambulatory pH study was done in 27 patients and pharyngeal reflux was present in 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative esophageal endoscopy was performed in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study revealed evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) in 14 patients with 8 having evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of the 29 patients had symptoms or findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients had laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) and 1 had an open procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five of the 29 patients (follow-up ranging from 6-108 mo) had excellent results with near-total freedom from symptoms and are taking no acid-suppressive medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GER has an important role in the cause of many otolaryngologic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nissen fundoplication is an effective modality to treat EER in selected cases </plain></SENT>
