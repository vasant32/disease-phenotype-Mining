<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lye strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, 21 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>Esophageal dilations</z:mp> had been performed in 29 patients, 12 of whom also had undergone previous surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative dilations by our group were used to determine further intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with dilatable strictures were randomized to either a Nissen or a Belsey operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this group, there were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and excellent or good clinical results were obtained in 28 of 34 (82%) patients, with no significant differences noted in the outcomes between the two operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with undilatable strictures, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, or mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> underwent resection plus colon interposition (N = 12) or resection plus gastric interposition (N = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients in the Nissen operation group later required resection and colon interposition, bringing that total to 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Resection plus colon interposition resulted in excellent or good results in 71% of patients, with a 7% operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a standard transthoracic antireflux procedure can be performed with a low risk when strictures are dilatable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Excellent or good results were obtained in 82% of patients, which is equivalent to results for more complex operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the outcome for the transthoracic Nissen procedure compared with the Belsey procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, when required, resection plus colon interposition provided excellent or good results in 71% of the patients </plain></SENT>
