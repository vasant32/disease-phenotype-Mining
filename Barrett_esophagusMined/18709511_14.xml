<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compare treatment outcome in patients with and without BE submitted to standardized laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the Long-Term Usage of Acid Suppression Versus Antireflux Surgery trial (a European multicenter randomized study), LARS was compared with dose-adjusted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> (20-40 mg daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Operative difficulty, complications, symptom outcomes [Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and Quality of Life in Reflux and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dyspepsia</z:e> (QOLRAD)], and treatment failure at 3 years and pH testing (after 6 months) are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 554 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, 60 had BE-28 randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> and 32 to LARS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Very few BE patients on either treatment strategy (four of 60) experienced treatment failure during the 3-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Esophageal pH in BE patients was significantly better controlled after surgical treatment than after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> (p = 0.002), although mean GSRS and QOLRAD scores were similar for the two therapies at baseline and at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although operative difficulty was slightly greater in patients with BE than those without, there was no difference in postoperative complications or level of symptomatic reflux control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a well-controlled surgical environment, the success of LARS is similar in patients with or without BE and matches optimized medical therapy </plain></SENT>
