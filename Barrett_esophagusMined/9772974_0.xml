<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 555 patients (46.5%) presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, 101 (8.5%), with Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 538 (45%) with cardia <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patient underwent a transthoracic esophagectomy with esophagogastroplasty; transhiatal approach was mainly reserved to high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the past two years sixty-three patients (42 with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 21 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>) underwent enlarged mediastinal lymphadenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients (4.7%) died post-operatively: one <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients (6.3%) developed pulmonary complications: no patient had recuriential palsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathologic exam revealed 1342 nodes (807 thoracic and 827 abdominal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (31.7%) had mediastinal nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, of which 8 in the upper mediastinum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 19 months (2-36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of the sixteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> (12 systemic, 3 mediastinal and 1 anastomotic) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of metastatic nodes increased with serial section and even more with immunohistochemical staining technique (from 11.7% to 13% to 15.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients were up-staged from M0 to M1 because of peripancreatic nodal micrometastases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that enlarged mediastinal lymphadenectomy allowed to detect upper mediastinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> in 12.8% of patients without increasing post-operative complication rate </plain></SENT>
