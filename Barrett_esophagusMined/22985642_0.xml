<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Practice guidelines recommend surveillance endoscopy every 2 to 3 years among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) to detect early neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although surveys report that &gt;95% of gastroenterologists recommend or practice BE surveillance, the extent and patterns of surveillance in clinical practice are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the extent and determinants of endoscopic surveillance among BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A total of 121 Veterans Affairs facilities nationwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Veteran patients with BE diagnosed from 2003 to 2009, with follow-up through September 30, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Not an interventional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The proportions of patients with BE who received any EGD after the index BE EGD date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of patients with at least 6 years of follow-up, we also calculated proportions for regular (EGD during both 3-year intervals), irregular (EGD in only 1 interval), and no surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We examined differences in demographics and clinical and facility factors among these groups in unadjusted and adjusted analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 29,504 patients with BE; 97% were men, 83% white, and their mean age was 61.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During a 3.8-year median follow-up period, 45.4% of patients with BE received at least one EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the subgroup of 4499 patients with BE who had at least 6 years of follow-up, 23.0% had regular surveillance, and 26.7% had irregular surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was considerable facility-level variation in percentages with surveillance EGD across the 112 facilities and by geographic region of these facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical factors did not explain these variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with at least one EGD were significantly more likely to be white; to be aged &lt;65 years, with a low level of comorbidity; to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo>; to have more outpatient visits; and to be seen in smaller hospitals (&lt;87 beds) than those without any EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: There might be misclassification of BE and surveillance EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Lack of pathology data on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, which dictates surveillance intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endoscopic surveillance for BE is considerably less commonly practiced in Veterans Affairs facilities than is self-reported by physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although several clinical factors are associated with variations in surveillance, facility-level factors play a large role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The comparative effectiveness of the different practice-based surveillance patterns needs to be examined </plain></SENT>
