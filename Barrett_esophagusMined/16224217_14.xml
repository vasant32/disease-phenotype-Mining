<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gene that encodes methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), an enzyme involved in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> and methionine salvage pathways, is located on chromosome 9p21 telomeric to the p16INK4A/CDKN2A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inactivation of the p16INK4A/CDKN2A gene occurs by three different mechanisms: hypermethylation of the gene promoter, intragenic mutation coupled with loss of the second allele, and homozygous deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical labeling for the p16INK4A/CDKN2A gene product parallels gene status but does not elucidate the mechanism of gene inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the MTAP gene is often co-deleted with p16INK4A/CDKN2A, concurrent immunolabeling for both proteins can identify cases with homozygous p16INK4A/CDKN2A gene deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MTAP loss itself has therapeutic implications since it may confer selective sensitivity to inhibitors of de novo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> biosynthesis, such as L-alanosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve tissue microarrays were constructed from 92 cases of Barrett-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and precursor lesions and 112 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and precursor lesions comprising 1161 individual cores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple cores were arrayed from any given case, and when available, included the entire histologic spectrum of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue microarrays were labeled with monoclonal antibodies against MTAP protein (clone 6.9, Salmedix, Inc) and p16 (clone 16P07, Neomarkers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete loss of labeling was considered negative, while any labeling (p16: nuclear; MTAP: cytoplasmic and nuclear) was considered positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Loss of MTAP labeling occurred exclusively in conjunction with loss of p16 labeling, confirming that the previous findings from this group that concurrent loss of MTAP and p16 labeling is a surrogate marker of 9p21 homozygous deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete loss of MTAP and p16 was seen in 4 of 25 (16%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 4 of 18 (22%) with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 5 of 39 (13%) with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 17 of 78 (22%) with invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and 8 of 36 (22%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 7 cases of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with loss of both MTAP and p16 for which precursor lesions were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 6 on these 7 cases (85%), the precursor lesion(s) had loss of both MTAP and p16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lack of MTAP and p16 expression was seen in 11 of 106 (10%) cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> metaplastic (30 biopsies from 20 cases) and dysplastic (15 biopsies from 13 cases) gastric tissues had both intact MTAP and p16INK4A/CDKN2A gene products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No precursor lesions were available from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> that had loss of both MTAP and p16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two benign gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> also had intact p16 and MTAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Concurrent MTAP and p16 loss detected by immunohistochemistry can serve as a convenient surrogate for p16INK4A/CDKN2A gene homozygous deletion in archival tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Inactivation of p16INK4A/CDKN2A by homozygous deletion appears to be an early event in Barrett <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, occurring in noninvasive precursor lesions, including nondysplastic Barrett mucosa, in subsets of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the absence of MTAP, cells depend exclusively on the de novo synthesis pathway for production of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This loss of MTAP during 9p21 homozygous deletion might be exploited therapeutically using de novo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> synthesis <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolites</z:chebi> to treat a subset of invasive gastroesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and esophageal precursor lesions </plain></SENT>
