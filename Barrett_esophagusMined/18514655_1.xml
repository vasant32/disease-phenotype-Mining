<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The standard test for diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a conventional upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, studies have shown that confirmation of BE by endoscopy with histologic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> can be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the overall accuracy, as well as factors that influence the accuracy of a conventional upper endoscopy in diagnosing BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Thirteen academic, community, and Veterans Affairs sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective data review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients who underwent an upper endoscopy with a finding of "suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>" and esophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathology reports were examined to identify cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of pathology-confirmed BE among suspected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2511 procedures were examined; the frequency of biopsy-confirmed BE was 48.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression identified the following factors to be independently associated with biopsy-confirmed BE: long-segment BE that measured &gt; or = 3 cm (odds ratio [OR] 4.61 [95% CI, 3.73-5.69]), male sex (OR 1.82 [95% CI, 1.49-2.22]), increasing age (age interval 70-79 years with OR 2.33 compared with age &lt;50 years [95% CI, 1.75-3.10]), the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (OR 1.46 [95% CI, 1.22-1.84]), and white race (OR 1.90 [95% CI, 1.49-2.22]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Biopsy specimens were assumed to sample the tubular esophagus; the actual pathology slides were not reevaluated by the investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic evaluation has limitations for the diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Specific patient and endoscopic characteristics may be associated with the confirmation of BE on biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further study is needed to determine if new endoscopic imaging technologies improve the ability to correctly identify BE </plain></SENT>
