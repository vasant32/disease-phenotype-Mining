<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024232" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastases, lymphatic</z:e> vascular invasion, and multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients with pT1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> who underwent esophagectomy without preoperative therapy and assess their potential implication for ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent esophagectomy without preoperative therapy for pT1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A detailed review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathology reports was performed to identify relevant pathologic criteria including depth of invasion (T1a or T1b), cell type (<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>/squamous), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation (poor vs. well/moderate), extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (short segment [SSBE] and long segment [LSBE]), nodal status, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and the presence of multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (MFN) (high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and disease-specific survival were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 75 consecutive patients (58 men, 17 women) between January 1994 and September 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age was 68 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 2.6% (2 of 75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients had T1a and 45 had T1b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were present in 2 of 30 (6%) T1a and 8 of 45 (17.5%) T1b <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MFN was present in 30% (9 of 30) of T1a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and 29% (13 of 45) of T1b <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 9 patients with LVI had T1b <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Collectively, 10 of 30 (33.3%) patients with T1a and 25 of 45 (58%) with T1b had MFN, LVI, or nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with associated BE (23 SSBE, 26 LSBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between patients with SSBE and those with LSBE in the incidence of nodal disease (2 of 23 vs. 2 of 26) but a significant difference in the incidence of MFN (3 of 23 vs. 13 of 26, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Four patients with squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> had nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and 5 had MFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Overall 5-year survival was 78% (T1a:90% T1b: 71%, P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Five-year disease-specific survival was 86.5% (T1a: 96.7%, T1b: 79.6%, P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combined high incidence of MFN, LVI, and occult nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> does not support the use of ET in patients with T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> regardless of depth of invasion, cell type, differentiation or extent of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>ET may be of value in patients in whom surgical risk is considered prohibitive </plain></SENT>
