<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and gastric cardia has been rising rapidly in Western Europe and the United States, especially among white males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports, based on case series, have suggested an association between colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, a metaplastic condition of the lower esophagus that can lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence data from 1973 to 1989 from the nine population-based registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of the United States National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute to investigate this association, using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> as an outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a case-control design, we measured the odds of being diagnosed with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> some time in life among persons diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus or gastric cardia relative to persons diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among white males the odds ratio was 1.44 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association appeared to be independent of which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> occurred first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, white females with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were less likely to be diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> than those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These associations appeared to be specific for colorectal tissue because there was no relationship between histological type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> in men or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that men with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> may be more likely to be diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in their lifetime than expected; the opposite association may exist for women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
