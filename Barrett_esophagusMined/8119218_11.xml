<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanism is discussed by which certain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35803">nitrosamines</z:chebi> induce <z:mp ids='MP_0003277'>esophageal papillomas</z:mp> and squamous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in rats, and some evidence is presented for the view that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35803">nitrosamines</z:chebi> also induce the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in humans, especially in China and South Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies on the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35803">nitrosamines</z:chebi> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> isozymes in rat and human esophagus, including the activation reactions of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> and pentaldehyde formation from <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-n-amylnitrosamine (MNAN), are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These reactions are catalyzed by microsomes from the rat and human esophagus, probably because these microsomes contain specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> isozymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence is reviewed for the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35803">nitrosamines</z:chebi> related to MNAN in fungus-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162011" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infected corn</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is rising in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The precursor lesion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, suggesting a role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> in the induction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies are described in which rats were subjected to esophago-duodenostomy (joining the duodenum to the esophagus) and then treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35803">nitrosamines</z:chebi> that normally induce esophageal squamous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the lower esophagus were induced as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (under one set of conditions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Feeding a high-fat diet with this system increased the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was not induced when the operation was changed to esophago-gastroplasty (widening the lower esophageal sphincter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results support a role of reflux of duodenal contents (including bile and pancreatic juice) rather than of gastric contents in the etiology of human esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
