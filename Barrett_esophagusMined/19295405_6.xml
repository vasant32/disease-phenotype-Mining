<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A distinctive type of multilayered epithelium (ME) that exhibits features of both squamous and columnar epithelium has been hypothesized to represent an early, or intermediate, phase in the development of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the prevalence and specificity of ME in mucosal biopsies of the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) from patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, either with or without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During endoscopic examination of the esophagus, 2 biopsy specimens were obtained from across the SCJ from 27 patients with BE, 12 patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> without BE, and 14 controls who had no symptoms or endoscopic or histologic signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ME was present at the SCJ in 33%, 33%, and 0% of BE, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, and control patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with control subjects, the prevalence of ME was significantly higher in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and BE patients (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients without BE, ME was always detected adjacent to areas of cardia-type mucosa composed of mucous glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ME from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients and BE patients had a similar immunophenotype, showing expression of the intestinal markers MUC2 and cdx-2 in 38% and 77% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of expression of these markers in ME was significantly different from nongoblet epithelium in control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results provide further evidence that ME may represent an early, transitional form of columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, and that ME may be used as a histologic marker of reflux disease in mucosal biopsies from the gastroesophageal junction region </plain></SENT>
