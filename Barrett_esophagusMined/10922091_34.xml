<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is recommended to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at an early and potentially treatable stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the clinical practice patterns for endoscopic surveillance in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire regarding surveillance intervals, techniques and management approaches for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was mailed to 1000 randomly selected members of the Clinical Practice Section of the American Gastroenterological Association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate was 455 of 1000 (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> respondents answered <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine percent of respondents were in community practices, and 21% were in academic practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (96%) performed endoscopic surveillance, but it was practiced more commonly in the community (334 of 341 [98%]) than in the academic setting (83 of 93 [89%], p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, endoscopic surveillance was most commonly performed every 2 years (264 of 415 [64%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> usually had surveillance endoscopy at 6-month intervals (215 of 413 [52%]), whereas those with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> most commonly had endoscopy every 3 months (201 of 404 [50%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These surveillance patterns did not differ between the academic and community groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Random biopsies were performed by 93 of 403 (23%), 4-quadrant biopsies by 310 (77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most physicians (83%) used standard capacity forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Brush cytology was done uncommonly (69 of 414 [17%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most common indications for esophagectomy were high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by 82% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> by 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ablation therapy was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by 3.5%, Barrett's with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by 20%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> by 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is widely practiced in the United States but there is considerable variation in interval and technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A clearer consensus on endoscopic surveillance is warranted to optimize care of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
