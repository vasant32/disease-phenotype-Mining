<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a group of 12 patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> resistant to the medical treatment and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LES pressure, gastric emptying and bile-gastric (B.G.) reflux (HIDA-CCK test) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>delayed gastric emptying</z:mp> associated in seven with high levels of B.G. reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients had an unsuccessful fundoplication two years ago and five have been cured of duodenal 3 or gastric 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> with antacids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although there was an evolution to an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> scar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients the abdominal post-prandial pain persisted and some of them maintained occasional bilious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastric mucosa was demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was an isolated phenomenon in 3 patients, one had a peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> above de cardia, and another one a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A proximal gastric vagotomy (PGV) and pyloroplasty was performed in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>delayed gastric emptying</z:mp> without BG reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other 7 patients with concomitant high BG reflux were treated by a duodenal diversion to a Roux-en-Y loop and P.G.V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophageal and gastric symptoms disappeared soon after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Esophageal biopsies were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> six months after surgery and the intense <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> changed to a less serious form of superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>delayed gastric emptying</z:mp> associated or not with high values of BG reflux can be the most important pathogenic factor that cause reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The improvement of gastric emptying and elimination of BG reflux can be the proper method to treat these situations </plain></SENT>
