<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 220 BE patients, 224 EAC patients, and 256 frequency-matched controls completed a lifestyle and food frequency questionnaire and provided serum and toenail samples between 2002 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using multiple logistic regression, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated within quartiles of intake/status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparing the fourth to the first quartile, ferritin (OR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.97) and transferrin saturation (OR 0.41; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.82) were negatively associated with BE; while total iron binding capacity was positively associated per 50 Î¼g/dl increment (OR 1.47; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing the fourth to the first quartile, iron intake (OR 0.50; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.98), non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intake per 10 mg/day increment (OR 0.29; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.99), and toenail iron (OR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.93) were negatively associated with EAC; while <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intake was positively associated (OR 3.11 95% CI: 1.46, 6.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL CONCLUSION: In contrast to the hypothesis that increased iron intakes and higher iron stores are a risk factor for BE and EAC, this study suggests that higher iron intakes and stores may have a protective association with BE and EAC, with the exception of what was found for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intake </plain></SENT>
