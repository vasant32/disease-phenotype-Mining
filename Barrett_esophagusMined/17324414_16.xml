<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE) is an alternative to EGD for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A multicenter study found ECE to be safe, well tolerated, and accurate; however, a post hoc adjudication process was used that may have biased results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of ECE for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective and blinded, with no adjudication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Screening patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and surveillance patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: ECE followed by EGD in each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of ECE for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> by using EGD results, with histologic confirmation as the criterion standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-six subjects were enrolled, of whom 90 (94%) completed the study, including 66 screening and 24 surveillance patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ECE was 67% sensitive and 84% specific for identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, diagnosing 14 of 21 cases of biopsy-confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Positive and negative predictive values were 22% and 98%, respectively (calculated for screening patients only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity for short- and long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our blinded, unadjudicated study shows that ECE had only moderate sensitivity and specificity for identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ECE in its present form is not suitable as a primary screening tool for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> but may be used in patients unwilling to undergo EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Inadequate visualization of the gastroesophageal junction may be the cause of suboptimal ECE accuracy; this may be improved by advances in ingestion protocol and capsule calibration </plain></SENT>
