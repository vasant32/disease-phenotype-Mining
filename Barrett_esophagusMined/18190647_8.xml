<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate prospectively the diagnostic yield of ECE in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients (40 men, mean age 54 yr) referred to five endoscopic centers for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients first underwent ECE, then EGD; endoscopists who performed the EGD were blind to the ECE data that were interpreted separately by two independent readers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Los Angeles, Prague, and Montreal classification systems were used to describe endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>Esophagitis</z:hpo> and endoscopically suspected esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (ESEM) were present in 24 and 10 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Columnar lining was histologically confirmed in seven patients (3 with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and 4 with <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The kappa values for interobserver agreement regarding the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and ESEM were 0.67 (0.49-0.85) and 0.49 (0.17-0.81), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic yields of ECE to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and ESEM were as follows: sensitivity 79% and 60%, specificity 94% and 100%, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) 83% and 100%, negative predictive value (NPV) 92% and 95%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As a screening tool in patients with reflux symptoms, ECE has an excellent specificity and NPV for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and ESEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, its sensitivity for the diagnosis of ESEM is not optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to improve the procedure, and to compare the cost-effectiveness of strategies using ECE or EGD </plain></SENT>
