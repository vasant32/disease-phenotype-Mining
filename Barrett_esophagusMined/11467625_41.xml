<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Accurately predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression analysis of symptom questionnaire scores we created a model to predict the presence of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a logistic regression analysis of symptom data collected prospectively on 517 GERD patients and created a prediction model based on patient gender, age, ethnicity, and symptom severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 337 (65%) males and 180 (35%) females, of whom 99 (19%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictive ability of gender, age, and ethnicity along with symptoms of heartburn, nocturnal pain, odynophagia, presence of belching, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, relief of symptoms with food, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only significant predictors (at the 0.05 level) were male gender, heartburn, nocturnal pain, and odynophagia (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with positive effects on the presence of BE) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (which had a negative effect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A nomogram was produced to show the effect of a given predictor on the probability of having BE in the context of the effects of the other predictors, and to estimate the probability of having BE for a given individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean score (+/-SD) for the BE patients in our sample was 397.4+/-46.2 with a range of 292-530 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the patients without BE, the mean score (+/-SD) was 351.3+/-60.3 with a range of 190 - 528 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If screening for BE is performed at a score of 375 or more, our model would have a specificity of 63% with a sensitivity of 77% (95% CI 61-86% given the 63% specificity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By asking seven questions about symptom severity, clinicians may be able to assign a probability to the presence of BE, and thus, determine the need for endoscopy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
