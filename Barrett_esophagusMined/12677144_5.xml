<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) modifies the results of Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Some authors consider that BE, whether or not there is associated stricture, significantly increases the failure rate of standard antireflux surgery; they recommend using different and more aggressive surgical procedures in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred seventy-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, were included in a retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: those with BE (n = 57) and those without BE (n = 120) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nissen fundoplication was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by the same surgical team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical, endoscopic, and functional (manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring) results in the two study groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 5 years (range 1-18) in the BE group and 6 years (range 1-18) in the non-BE group, the rate of clinical recurrence was 8% in the BE group and 10% in the non-BE group, with no statistically significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of pH-metric recurrence was the same in both groups (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of BE without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> does not increase the rate of failure of Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
