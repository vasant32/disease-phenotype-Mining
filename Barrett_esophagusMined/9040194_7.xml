<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cause of the rapid increase in the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus since the 1970s is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that duodenogastroesophageal reflux causes <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus by comparing the frequency of gastric surgery (a human model of duodenogastroesophageal reflux) and other potential risk factors between patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the esophagus seen at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between 1987 and 1994 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following data were retrieved: age, gender, race, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, history of gastric surgery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms, and use of tobacco, alcohol, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>-2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The data of 325 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (73.5%) and 117 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (26.5%) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between the groups in age, proportion with gastric surgery (patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>: 1.2%, 95% confidence interval 0.3-3.1%; patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>: 0.9%, 95% confidence interval 0.0-4.7%), smoking (76.7 vs 81.6%), or alcohol use (71.8 vs 79.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant risk factors associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus were male gender, white race, distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> location, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Previous gastric surgery is rarely found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> and is performed with equal frequency in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that gastric surgery and its associated duodenogastroesophageal reflux do not play a role in the etiology and rising incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>White males in their mid-60s with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who smoke and drink alcohol are at highest risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
