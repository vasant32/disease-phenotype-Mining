<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus not present in the specimens studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> esophageal columnar epithelium, the DNA synthesis phase averaged 10.4 +/- 0.3 hr; labeling index of cells in the crypt-like structures was 23.3 +/- 0.3%; generation time was 44.6 +/- 1.2 hr, and the mitotic index was 1.82 +/- 0.07% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were not present among specimens with columnar epithelium but they differed from cell proliferation in adjacent squamous epithelium where S phase was similar but labeling and mitotic indexes were lower and generation time increased to 105 +/- 6 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 2 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus, and in 1 of 9 without <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, labeling of surface columnar cells after brief exposure to [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> was present suggests that this may be a manifestation of early malignant change </plain></SENT>
