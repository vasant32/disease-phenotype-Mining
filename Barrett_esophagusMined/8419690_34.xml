<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared symptoms, esophageal acid and alkaline exposure (pH &lt; 2, &lt; 3, &lt; 4, and &gt; 7), lower esophageal sphincter resistance, esophageal clearance function, the gastric secretory state, gastric emptying, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> in 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with 24 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and with 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had less heartburn and regurgitation but had an increased frequency and duration of reflux episodes and percent time pH less than 2, less than 3, less than 4, and pH greater than 7 on ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a decreased lower esophageal sphincter resistance, a decreased contraction amplitude in the distal area of the esophagus, an increased frequency of nonperistaltic contractions and contractions less than 30 mm Hg on 24-hour ambulatory esophageal motility monitoring, increased basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, and a higher prevalence of excessive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data show that despite less symptoms patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have a markedly increased esophageal acid and alkaline exposure compared with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This appears to be because of persistent reflux of highly concentrated gastric acid and duodenal contents across a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter in combination with inefficient esophageal clearance function </plain></SENT>
