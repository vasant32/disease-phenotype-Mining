<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is limited information on independent predictors of nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and patient demographics, symptoms, clinical and endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting to the gastrointestinal endoscopy unit for evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms undergoing index endoscopy were asked to complete a validated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographics, clinical features, and endoscopic findings were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> was defined as awakening at night by heartburn or acid regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient factors were compared using Ï‡ and Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> factors that were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) were entered into a stepwise logistic regression to evaluate for independent predictors of nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 908 GERD patients evaluated, 665 (73.2%) reported nocturnal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients were male (93%) and White (83%) with a mean age of 57.2 years (SD 12.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, younger age, higher body mass index, daily heartburn, heartburn duration of &gt;5 years, severe heartburn, daily regurgitation, regurgitation duration &gt;5 years (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05), and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (P=0.02) were significantly associated with the presence of nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, severe heartburn [3.3 (2.1 to 5.1), P&lt;0.01] and daily heartburn [1.5(1.1 to 2.3), P=0.03], daily regurgitation [2.2 (1.1 to 4.2), P=0.025], and regurgitation duration of &gt;5 years [1.7 (1.2 to 2.4), P&lt;0.01], and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> [1.4 (1.1 to 2.0), P=0.03] were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> independent risk factors for nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results of this large prospective cohort study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients suggest that nocturnal symptoms are reported by 3 quarters of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with frequent and severe daytime symptoms are significantly more likely to experience nocturnal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> between patients with and without nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Finally, presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> on endoscopy is also an independent risk factor for nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
