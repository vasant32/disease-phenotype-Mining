<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) are the primary risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the significance of age at symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of multiple dimensions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> exposure on BE risk and whether these associations are modified by other risk factors for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were from a cross-sectional study of 683 Veterans Affairs patients undergoing an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or a study EGD concurrently with colonoscopy from primary care clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared 236 patients with both endoscopically suspected and histologically confirmed BE to 447 primary-care patients ("primary-care controls") without endoscopically suspected BE on their study EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> &lt;30 years of frequent (at least weekly) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms was associated with highest risk of BE (OR=15.1, 95% CI 7.91-28.8), and risk increased linearly with earlier age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms (P-trend=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association was independent of cumulative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptom duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>People with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms who reported ever using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> were at especially high risk of BE (OR=31.1, 95% CI 13.9-69.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In people with frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, BE risk was almost 80% lower among Helicobacter pylori-positive patients (OR=2.60, 95% CI 1.26-5.40) than those negative for H. pylori (OR=8.24, 95% CI 5.00-13.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk of BE increased linearly with earlier age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age at symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> may help practitioners decide which patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms to refer for endoscopic screening for BE </plain></SENT>
