<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are few prospective studies that document the histologic follow-up after antireflux surgery in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, as defined by the recently standardized criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic results of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> followed postoperatively for at least 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> required preoperative endoscopic evidence of columnar-lined epithelium in the esophagus and a biopsy demonstrating specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, which stains positively with Alcian blue stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between April 1993 and November 1998, a total of 104 patients meeting these criteria underwent fundoplication (laparoscopic [n = 84] or open [n = 6] nissen, laparoscopic Toupet [n = 11], laparoscopic Collis-Nissen [n = 1], Collins-Toupet [n = 1] or open Dor [n = 1]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (length of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> &lt;3 cm) was found preoperatively in 34% and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 4% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were contacted yearly by mail, phone, or clinic visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 4.6 years (range 2 to 7.5 years), 81% of patients had stopped taking antisecretory medications and 97% were satisfied with the results of their operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight patients have undergone reoperation for recurrence of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients have died and two were excluded from endoscopic biopsy because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients complied with the surveillance protocol, and their histologic results were returned to our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic follow-up of the 34 patients who refused surveillance esophagogastro and duodenoscopy revealed two patients who were taking medication for reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients have developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> during surveillance endoscopy (337 total patient-years of follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of regression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> to cardiac-fundic-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> after successful antireflux surgery is greater than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suspect that this is a result of longer follow-up and the inclusion of patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A substantial number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who are asymptomatic after antireflux surgery refuse surveillance endoscopy </plain></SENT>
