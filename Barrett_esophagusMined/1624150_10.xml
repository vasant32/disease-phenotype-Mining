<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have evaluated the proliferation of squamous epithelium, columnar epithelium from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e> and gastric columnar epithelium from 23 Barrett's patients using positive immunoreactivity with the mouse monoclonal antibody Ki67 (which recognises an antigen associated with proliferative cells) with a view to using this parameter as a biomarker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Squamous epithelium had significantly higher Ki67 immunostaining as compared with columnar epithelium from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e> (when examining the tissue with greater than 15% cells staining positive for Ki67, Fisher's exact test p = 0.004) but there was no difference found between the epithelium from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e> and gastric columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between histological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and Ki67 immunoreactivity of Barrett's mucosa, and the Ki67 immunostaining of two patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was no different from the rest of the group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a significant correlation between the Ki67 immunoreactivity of columnar epithelium from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e> and columnar epithelium from the stomach (correlation coefficient = 0.44, p = 0.03) suggesting that epithelium from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e> behaves in a similar fashion to gastric epithelium </plain></SENT>
