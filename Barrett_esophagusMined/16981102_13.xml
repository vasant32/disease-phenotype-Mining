<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autofluorescence endoscopy (AFE) may make it easier to locate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to elucidate the diagnostic accuracy of surveillance with AFE-guided plus four-quadrant biopsies in comparison with the conventional approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 187 of 200 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients who were initially enrolled (73 % male, mean age 67 years, mean Barrett's segment length 4.6 cm), who underwent endoscopy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in four study centers, were randomly assigned to undergo either AFE-targeted biopsy followed by four-quadrant biopsies or conventional endoscopic surveillance, also including four-quadrant biopsies (study phase 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of patients with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, who underwent endoscopic or surgical treatment, as well as those who declined to participate in phase 2 of the study, 130 patients remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients were examined again with the alternative method after a mean of 10 weeks, using the same methods described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main study parameter was the detection of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), comparing both approaches in study phase 1; the secondary study aim in phase 2 was to assess the additional value of the AFE-guided approach after conventional surveillance, and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Test accuracy measures were derived from study phase 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In study phase 1, the AFE and conventional approaches yielded <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>/HGD rates of 12 % and 5.3 %, respectively, on a per-patient basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With AFE, four previously unrecognized <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>/HGD lesions were identified (4.3 % of the patients); with the conventional approach, one new lesion (1.1 %) was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>/HGD lesions detected during AFE endoscopy in study phase 1, eight were visualized, while 11 were only detected using untargeted four-quadrant biopsies (sensitivity 42 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 766 biopsies classified at histology as being nonneoplastic, 58 appeared suspicious (specificity 92 %, positive predictive value 12 %, negative predictive value 98.5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In study phase 2, AFE detected two further lesions in addition to the initial alternative approach in 3.2 % of cases, in comparison with one lesion with conventional endoscopy (1.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this referral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> population with a higher prevalence of neoplastic lesions, the AFE-guided approach improved the diagnostic yield for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in comparison with the conventional approach using four-quadrant biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, AFE alone was not suitable for replacing the standard four-quadrant biopsy protocol </plain></SENT>
