<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of increased expression of the cyclin D1 protein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using 69 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human esophageal specimens, which had been removed endoscopically or obtained at surgery during 1993 and 1994, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> immunohistochemical analyses were performed using an avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> complex immunoperoxidase technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased nuclear expression of the cyclin D1 protein was noted in 32 of 69 samples (46%; 44% of the samples from males and 50% of the samples from females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive nuclear staining for the cyclin D1 protein in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's disease</z:e> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was found in 38% of the male cases and 25% of the female cases, whereas in <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> it was positive in 33% of men and 48% of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear accumulation of the cyclin D1 protein was also found in both dysplastic and nondysplastic lesions, and it was not associated with sex, age, or cigarette or alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Samples from patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> tended to be less frequently positive (32%) for cyclin D1 nuclear staining when compared to patients taking H2 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (45%) or antacids (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that increased expression of cyclin D1 is an early event in the tumorigenic process of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and that the increased expression of this gene might predispose the epithelium to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
