<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, however, a frequent loss of CAR has been noted potentially hampering the success of adenovirus-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In esophageal Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and its precursor lesions CAR presence has not been systematically determined yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical assessment in tissue specimens of 111 patients revealed CAR-positivity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, including various degrees of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no considerable CAR presence was seen in squamous esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, 93% displayed CAR presence, whereas CAR-negativity was observed preferentially in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aiming to evaluate whether this loss of CAR impacts <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-biologic properties of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> we studied cell lines OE19 and OE33 and observed an increased proliferation, migration and invasion upon siRNA-mediated functional CAR knock down </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results indicate that CAR may provide a valuable target for adenovirus-based therapy of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and its precursor lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data do also suggest that CAR does not contribute substantially to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, however, it may be speculated that loss of CAR promotes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> in advanced stages of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
