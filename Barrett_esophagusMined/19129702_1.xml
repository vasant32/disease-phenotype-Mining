<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005231'>Chronic gastritis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> are associated with changes in mucosal glycosylation patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lectins represent a group of specific carbohydrate binding proteins that can be used as sensitive tools for the analysis of glycosylation patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the binding patterns of lectins Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), Helix pomatia agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>) and peanut agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>) at the gastroesophageal junction in nonerosive (NERD), erosive reflux disease (ERD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two patients (female n = 53; male n = 69; controls n = 28; NERD n = 36; ERD n = 24 and BE n = 34) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The binding patterns of lectins were examined immunohistochemically at the squamocolumnar junction, in squamous epithelium and columnar-lined epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staining patterns of lectins were semiquantitatively evaluated using an immunohistochemical score and the data were analyzed using non-parametric tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE, as compared to the controls, was associated with specific lectin-binding patterns: lectin binding of UEA-I and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> were significantly decreased at the superficial (p = 0.012; p = 0.00036, respectively) and at the deep glandular body (p = 0.045; p = 0.055, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of lectin-staining scores between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and BE revealed significant increases of UEA-I in both the stratum superficiale (p = 0.0155) and stratum spinosum (p = 0.0048) of SE in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Notable, this change was specific for patients with BE, while no difference was observed between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found two major types of lectin-binding patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>First, lectin-binding characteristics associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in general, and second, lectin-binding patterns which were specific for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lectin UEA-I-binding proteins were specifically increased in the squamous epithelium of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, UEA-I may serve as a potential marker for BE, especially in patients with short segment BE </plain></SENT>
