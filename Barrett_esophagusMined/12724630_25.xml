<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the short-term results of the radiofrequency treatment of the gastroesophageal junction known as the Stretta procedure versus laparoscopic fundoplication (LF) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The Stretta procedure has been shown to be safe, well tolerated, and highly effective in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presenting to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for surgical evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> between August 2000 and March 2002 were prospectively evaluated under an IRB-approved protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent esophageal motility testing and endoscopy that documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> preoperatively, either by a positive 24-hour pH study or biopsy-proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were offered the Stretta procedure if they had documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and did not have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> larger than 2 cm, LES pressure less than 8 mmHg, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo>, LES pressure less than 8 mmHg, or Barrett's were offered LF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were studied pre- and postoperatively with validated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-specific quality-of-life questionnaires (QOLRAD) and short-form health surveys (SF-12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current medication use and satisfaction with the procedure was also obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results are reported as mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five patients (age 49 +/- 14 years, 44% male, 56% female) underwent LF and 65 patients (age 46 +/- 12 years, 42%, 58% female) underwent the Stretta procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preoperative esophageal acid exposure time was higher in the LF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preoperative LES pressure was higher in the Stretta group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the LF group, 41% had large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> (&gt;2 cm), 8 patients required Collis gastroplasty, 6 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and 10 had undergone previous fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, the QOLRAD and SF-12 scores were significantly improved within both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was an equal magnitude of improvement between pre- and postoperative QOLRAD and SF-12 scores between Stretta and LF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight percent of Stretta patients were off <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi>, and an additional 31% had reduced their dose significantly; 97% of LF patients were off <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two Stretta patients returned for 24-hour pH testing at a mean of 7.2 +/- 0.5 months, and there was a significant reduction in esophageal acid exposure time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Both groups were highly satisfied with their procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a less invasive, endoscopic treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> to the surgical algorithm has allowed the authors to stratify the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients to treatment with either Stretta or LF according to size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, LES pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and significant pulmonary symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing Stretta are highly satisfied and have improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms and quality of life comparable to LF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The Stretta procedure is an effective alternative to LF in well-selected patients </plain></SENT>
