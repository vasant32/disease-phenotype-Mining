<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is currently not clear whether cigarette smoking increases the risk of developing BE, and no meta-analysis has been performed on the topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, providing a quantitative estimate of the increased risk of BE associated with cigarette smoking, to help clarify whether a relationship exists between smoking and BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Current Contents Connect) were searched to April 18, 2012, for observational studies of BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model for the association of smoking with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BE patients were compared with non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) controls as well as with population-based and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies comprising 7069 BE patients were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Having ever smoked was associated with an increased risk of BE compared with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> controls (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.20-1.74), population-based controls (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.15-1.76), but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> controls (OR 1.18; 95% CI 0.75-1.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The meta-analyses of the studies reporting the lowest and highest number of pack-years smoked showed an increased risk of BE (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.22-1.63) and (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.27-1.84), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking was associated with an increased risk of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Being an ever-smoker was associated with an increased risk of BE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A greater number of pack-years smoked was associated with a greater risk of BE </plain></SENT>
