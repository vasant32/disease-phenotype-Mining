<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who had cytogenetic abnormalities detected in their metaplastic epithelium developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> during prospective surveillance over a period of 1.5 to 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the 3 cases, cytogenetic abnormalities that were associated with the most advanced histological lesions were present in samples obtained 11, 25, and 48 months prior to the diagnosis of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a fourth patient, marker chromosomes found in a Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were also present in an esophageal region spatially removed from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were present in samples obtained at widespread locations in the Barrett's segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> clonal proliferations arise in regions of benign histology and spread to involve large areas of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These clones persisted when the disease progressed to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
