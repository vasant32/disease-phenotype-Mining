<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chewing of regurgitated food with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0232604" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">rumination</z:e> elicits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) in baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protracted reflux transforms the distal multilayered squamous cell-lined epithelium into columnar-lined mucosa, with mucus-producing glands having interspersed oxyntic glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, this histological constellation is called Barrett's mucosa type 2 (BMT2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The distal esophagus together with the proximal stomach was removed en bloc, at autopsy, from 35 adult baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal sections were stained with toluidine blue, a stain that permits easy discrimination between parietal and chief gastric glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a calibrated ocular scale, the length of the BMT2 was assessed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 35 baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean length of the BMT2 was 9.80 mm (range 1.0 mm-40.2 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BMT2 in baboons is an integrated part of the natural phenomenon of mucosal adaptation to daily regurgitation of gastric acid into the distal esophagus (natural GER), whereas BMT2 in humans might reflect an evolutionary atavism in the esophagus, triggered by a non-physiological disorder (pathological GER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The baboon offers a suitable model to monitor the series of histological events that take place in the distal esophagus under the influence of protracted GER </plain></SENT>
