<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine whether endoscopic screening would identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in relatives of probands with BE or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> living first-degree relatives of patients with long segment BE or EAC presenting to the endoscopy suite of two academic hospitals were sent validated questionnaires inquiring about <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms and prior endoscopic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First-degree relatives of affected probands or affected relatives who reported no prior upper endoscopy were offered screening unsedated esophagoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relatives with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms were also offered an alternative of conventional sedated upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The yield of screening endoscopy was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screening endoscopy findings were then compared between family members of known FBE patients and those with "isolated" disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-eight relatives from 69 families, 23 known FBE probands and 46 probands with apparently "isolated" disease, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty relatives (29 FBE relatives and 11 relatives of probands with "isolated" disease) reported prior upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Screening upper endoscopies performed on 62 (25 FBE and 37 "isolated" disease relatives) of the remaining 158 relatives identified Barrett's epithelium in 13 (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to probands with apparently "isolated" disease, Barrett's epithelium (EAC, BE, or SSBE) was identified significantly more often in siblings and offspring of FBE probands, p&lt;/= 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic screening of relatives of FBE probands identified a multigeneration multiplex FBE pedigree consistent with an autosomally dominant inherited trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic screening of relatives of probands with reported "isolated" diseased did not identify any new FBE pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopy identified EAC, long-segment BE, and short-segment BE in a substantial proportion of first-degree relatives of affected members of FBE families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A familial susceptibility to develop Barrett's epithelium appears to be present in a subset of patients with BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
