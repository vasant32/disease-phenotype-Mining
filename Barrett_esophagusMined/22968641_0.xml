<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the feasibility and oncological results of ESD in patients with neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in conjunction with subsequent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who had visible lesions containing high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) or mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (MAC) up to 3 cm in diameter were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ESD was performed using a new waterjet-assisted system (WESD) with a HybridKnife (Erbe Elektromedizin GmbH, Tübingen, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was the rate of complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RFA of residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was offered to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with at least two negative follow-up endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 30 patients (m:f = 21:9; median age 60 years) with biopsy-proven MAC (n = 24) or HGIN (n = 6) with a median diameter of 2 cm, complete resection of the targeted area was achieved in 29 patients (96.7 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 82 % - 99 %); en bloc resection was achieved in 27 of these patients (90.0���%; 95 %CI 74 % - 97 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minor delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> occurred in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died due to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> 7 days after an uneventful WESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specimen histology (n = 29) revealed no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in 3 patients, HGIN in 2, MAC in 21, and submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in 3; complete resection was histologically confirmed in only 10 of the 26 patients with HGIN or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (38.5 %; 95 %CI 22 % - 57 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, endoscopic follow-up (median 17 months) showed complete remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in 27 /28 (96.4 %; 95 %CI 81 % - 99 %) patients who underwent successful WESD and were alive at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent EMR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Barrett's tissue was eradicated by ESD alone in 15 cases and by additional RFA in 8 /10 cases (not done in three patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ESD of Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is feasible and safe, but does not achieve sufficient R0 resection rates to warrant its recommended use over piecemeal EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In combination with RFA it can achieve complete eradication of neoplastic and non-neoplastic Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy between insufficient oncological resection and good medium-term results needs to be studied further </plain></SENT>
