<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> of the distal esophagus in which squamous epithelial cells are replaced by metaplastic intestinal-like columnar epithelium that contains goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The factors that contribute to the progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa to BE, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> are not well understood at the molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since reflux of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> is associated with BE development, we speculate that cells with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-resistant phenotype are selected after long-term repeated exposure to pulses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This will result in the survival of cells with unrepaired DNA damage, and a consequent increase in genomic instability leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major goal of this study is to compare sensitivity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23614">deoxycholate</z:chebi> (DOC), a known inducer of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous epithelium, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon epithelium, and BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients with a confirmed diagnosis of BE and four patients who had undergone clinically indicated colectomy were included in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Freshly obtained biopsies were incubated with control medium or medium supplemented with 1 mM DOC for 3 h and then evaluated for apoptotic changes using transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemical staining for two apoptotic markers, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved cytokeratin 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results indicate that BE is resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by DOC compared to esophageal squamous epithelium and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, electron micrographs revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> swelling in squamous epithelial cells treated ex vivo with DOC, which was absent in epithelial cells of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Formation of <z:mp ids='MP_0011632'>swollen mitochondria</z:mp> is an early marker of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Altogether, the data indicate that <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>reduced apoptosis</z:mp> capability in BE tissue may contribute to progression to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
