<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the clinical outcome of elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> 6 months to 3 years after diagnosis and to identify specific prognostic indicators of a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was a long-term (6 months to 3 years) follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients older than 65 years of age diagnosed as having reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> healed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment (2 to 4 months) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical examinations and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed every 6 months for the first year and annually thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After healing, no therapy was prescribed; in the event of symptom recurrence, a maintenance therapy consisting either of H2 blockers or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) was prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline and during follow-up, the following clinical parameters were recorded: gender, age, the presence of symptoms (heartburn, acid regurgitation, epigastric/<z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>), type and dose of the maintenance therapy, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug</z:chebi> use; gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo>, diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The chi-square test, the Kaplan-Meier test, and Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis were used for statistical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Included in the final analysis were 138 patients (M/F, 81/57; mean age, 79.7 years; range, 66-97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The numbers of patients in need of maintenance therapy were 47 of 69 (68.1%) after 6 months, 29 of 58 (50%) after 12 months, 17 of 39 (43.6%) after 24 months, and 12 of 26 (46.1%) after 36 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> relapse rate was found in patients not treated compared with subjects who were in maintenance therapy: 59% versus 8.5% (P &lt;.0001) at 6 months, 65.5% versus 20.7% at 12 months (P &lt;.002), 63.6% versus 11.7% at 24 months (P =.003), and 57.1% versus 8.3% at 36 months (P =.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in relapse rate was found in patients treated with H2 blockers versus <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> (21.7% versus 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Cox model demonstrated that no maintenance treatment (P =.00001), the presence of typical symptoms (P =.00001), the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (P =.03), and a high severity grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> at baseline (P =.009) were risk factors for relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In elderly subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> relapse occurs in a high percentage of cases, particularly in patients not treated with antisecretory drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of typical symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and a severe grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> are risk factors for relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The most effective measure for minimizing the occurrence of relapse is a maintenance therapy with antisecretory drugs </plain></SENT>
