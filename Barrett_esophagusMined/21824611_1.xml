<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: EMR is typically used to remove focal abnormalities of the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, larger areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) can be resected through side-by-side resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of EMR to completely remove BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective, single-center study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Between January 2006 and December 2010, 46 patients underwent EMR for complete removal of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three were lost to follow-up, one died of unrelated causes before completion, and one was still undergoing EMR treatment at the conclusion of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 41 patients were included for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The worst histologic grade was low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 4 patients, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in 26 patients, and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BE was circumferential in 65.9% of cases, and the mean (± SD) length was 3.3 ± 2.3 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: EMR was performed by using a cap (n = 4), a multiband ligator device (n = 31), or both (n = 6), with a mean (± SD) of 2.4 ± 1.2 sessions per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Remission rates and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Remission of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BE was achieved in 94.6%, 85.4%, and 78.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complications included minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (31.7%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> (4.9%), and strictures (43.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> complications were managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Complete removal of BE with EMR is effective but associated with a high complication rate, which is mainly related to stricture formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This needs to be considered when choosing between available treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
