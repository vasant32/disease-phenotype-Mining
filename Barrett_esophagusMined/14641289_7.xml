<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Actually, the only method to prevent the development to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is endoscopic surveillance, which ensures good results in terms of long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An ideal treatment capable of destroying columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, followed by squamous epithelium regeneration could potentially result in a decrease of the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently most ablative techniques were used, such as photodynamic therapy, ablation therapy with Nd-YAG laser or <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation and endoscopic mucosal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We started a prospective study in January 1998, enrolling 94 patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and candidates for antireflux repair in order to assess the effectiveness and the results of endoscopic coagulation with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma combined with surgery in the treatment of uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent endoscopic treatment with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma; we observed complete response in 68 patients (72.34%), 27 of them (39.7%) underwent antireflux surgery and the other 41 continued medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-operatively 19 patients (70%) underwent regular surveillance endoscopies and in two cases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The final objective of these combined treatments should be the complete eradication of metaplastic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our experience was that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation combined with antireflux surgery or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy gave satisfactory results, even if follow-up is too short to evaluate the potential evolution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we recommend that this technique should be done only in specialized centres and that these patients continue their endoscopic surveillance program </plain></SENT>
