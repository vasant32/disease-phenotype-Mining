<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND INFORMATION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus is the sixth leading cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the western world and is associated with a 5-year survival of less than 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that stromal-epithelial interactions are fundamental in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The advent of co-culture techniques permits the investigation of cross-talk between the stroma and epithelium in a physiological setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have characterized a histologically representative oesophageal organotypic model and have used it to compare the most commonly used squamous oesophageal cell line, HET-1A, with primary oesophageal squamous cells for use in studies of the oesophageal epithelium in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When grown in an organotypic culture with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts, the oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines OE21 (squamous) and OE19 (<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) morphologically resembled the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> of origin with evidence of stromal invasion and mucus production, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, HET-1A cells, which were derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous oesophageal cells, appeared dysplastic and failed to display evidence of squamous differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By comparison with primary oesophageal epithelial cells, the HET-1A cells were highly proliferative and did not express the epithelial markers E-cadherin or CK5/6 (casein kinase 5/6), or the stratified epithelial marker ΔNp63, but did express the mesenchymal markers vimentin and N-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Studies of epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> will benefit from culture systems which allow manipulation of the stromal and epithelial layers independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have developed an organotypic culture using primary oesophageal squamous cells and fibroblasts in which a stratified epithelium with a proliferative basal layer that stains strongly for ΔNp63 develops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This model will be suitable for the study of the molecular events in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most commonly used <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal squamous cell line, HET-1A, does not have the characteristics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal squamous cells and should not be used in models of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Until more representative cell lines are available, future studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> will be reliant on the availability and manipulation of primary tissue </plain></SENT>
