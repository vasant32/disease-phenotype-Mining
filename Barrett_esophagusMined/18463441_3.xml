<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the extent of variation in physician understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and associated conditions and symptoms is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the knowledge of primary care physicians with regard to: terminology related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, their understanding of related complications and extra-esophageal symptoms/conditions, and their use of guidelines relating to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gastroenterologists from 17 countries asked primary care physician colleagues to complete a one-page online survey on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 352 primary care physicians, (77% community-based, 23% hospital-based) completed the questionnaire </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extra-esophageal problems of cough, sleep-related disorders, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023067" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngitis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> were recognized to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> by 74, 50, 48 and 47% of respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine percent of physicians stated that they did not use a specific definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>; 33% used an international and 14% used a national guideline in managing patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is well recognized, but its related terminology is variable throughout the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) There was variable and incomplete recognition of extra-esophageal manifestations <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(3) Recognition of extra-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal diseases</z:e> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(4) Current <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> guidelines are infrequently used by primary care physicians </plain></SENT>
