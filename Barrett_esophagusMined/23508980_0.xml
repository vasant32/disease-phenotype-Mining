<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: Using validated OCT criteria for squamous mucosa, gastric cardia mucosa, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), the objective of this study was to determine the inter- and intra-observer agreements by a large number of OFDI readers for differentiating these tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: OFDI images were obtained from nine subjects undergoing screening and surveillance for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four OFDI image regions of interest were randomly selected for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A training set of 19 images was compiled distinguishing squamous mucosa from gastric cardia and BE using previously validated OCT criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ten readers then interpreted images in a test set of 45 different images of squamous mucosa (n = 15), gastric cardia (n = 15), or BE (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement differentiating the three tissue types and BE versus non-BE mucosa was determined using multi-rater Fleiss's κ value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The images were later randomized again and four readers repeated the test 3 weeks later to assess intraobserver reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ten readers showed excellent agreement for the differentiation of BE versus non-BE mucosa (κ = 0.811 p &lt; 0.0001) and for differentiating BE versus gastric cardia versus squamous mucosa (κ = 0.866, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the four readers who repeated the test, the median intraobserver agreement (BE vs. non-BE) was high (κ = 0.975, IQR: 0.94, 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Trained readers have a high interobserver agreement for differentiating BE, squamous, and gastric cardia mucosa using OFDI </plain></SENT>
