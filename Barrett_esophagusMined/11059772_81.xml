<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 appears to play an important role in gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, and COX-2 overexpression has been demonstrated both in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and in the metaplastic epithelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine whether selective inhibition of COX-2 by NS-398 would alter the rates of cell growth and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human Barrett's-associated esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>COX-1 and COX-2 expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines was determined using reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines were treated with various concentrations of NS-398 (selective for COX-2 inhibition) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5130">flurbiprofen</z:chebi> (selective for COX-1 inhibition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell growth was compared in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5130">flurbiprofen</z:chebi>-treated and untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines; cell growth and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were compared in NS-398-treated and untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>COX-2 mRNA and protein were detected in two of three cell lines (SEG-1 and FLO); the third cell line, BIC-1, did not express COX-2 mRNA or protein under basal conditions or after stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with COX-1-selective concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5130">flurbiprofen</z:chebi> did not affect cell growth in any of the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, treatment with COX-2-selective concentrations of NS-398 significantly suppressed cell growth and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in the cell lines that expressed COX-2 (SEG-1 and FLO), but not in the cell line that did not express COX-2 (BIC-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the administration of a selective inhibitor of COX-2 significantly decreases cell growth and increases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells that express COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest a potential role for selective COX-2 inhibitors in the prevention and treatment of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
