<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study describes Fas (CD95) expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus, and three esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> demonstrated cell surface expression of Fas protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 30.5% of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> examined by immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated faint cytoplasmic staining, and 69.5% were negative for Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar levels of Fas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> compared to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in esophageal squamous mucosa or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An approximately Mr 48,000 Fas protein was identified by Western blot analysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that were negative for Fas expression by immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line Seg-1 was negative for Fas expression by immunohistochemical analysis, but Western blot analysis demonstrated abundant, appropriately sized Fas protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In agreement with the immunohistochemical analysis, flow cytometry of Seg-1 showed minimal amounts of Fas on the cell surface, which correlated with resistance to Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mutations in the Seg-1 Fas coding sequence or exon 1 were identified by sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by transient transfection of COS cells with expression vectors generated from the Seg-1 Fas cDNA, which resulted in cell surface expression of the Fas protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stable transfection of Seg-1 with a Fas expression vector did not result in efficient Fas expression on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seg-1 cells, transiently transfected with a Fas-FLAG expression vector and examined for protein expression using confocal microscopy and an anti-FLAG antibody, showed that the Fas-FLAG protein was not present on the cell surface but was present in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that expression of Fas on the cell surface by esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In an esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Fas protein is retained in the cytoplasm, and this correlates with resistance to Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The retention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Fas protein within the cytoplasm may represent a mechanism by which malignant cells evade Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
