<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although transactivating protein isoforms display p53-like functions, deltaNp63 isoforms act toward p53 in a dominant negative way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the expression of pan-p63 and deltaNp63 in 50 esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCCs</z:mp>) as well as in squamous low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> (S-LGINs; n = 4) and high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> (S-HGINs; n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 50 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi>) that arose in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) as well as adjacent specialized metaplastic epithelium (SE; n = 41), low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> (B-LGINs; n = 27), and high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> (B-HGINs; n = 21) in BE were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, p63 gene amplification was determined by fluorescent differential polymerase chain reaction in a subset of 10 <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCCs</z:mp> and 10 ADCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium, expression of pan-p63 is invariably restricted to the basal cell layer, in 100% of S-LGINs, 94.4% of S-HGINs, and 88.0% of <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCCs</z:mp>, expression of p63 was found in &gt;75% of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concerning BE, only in a small subset of SEs (7.3%), B-LGINs (14.8%), B-HGINs (14.3%) and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> (16.0%) was a weak p63 protein expression (&lt;10% positive cells) detectable, whereas the rest of the samples were completely negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of deltaNp63 was identical to expression of pan-p63 in the vast majority of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p63 gene amplification was found in 2 of 10 (20.0%) investigated <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCCs</z:mp> and in 1 of 10 (10.0%) <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, strong expression of p63, especially its deltaNp63 isoforms, is a frequent finding in esophageal precancerous and cancerous squamous lesions, whereas this is not the case in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>p63 gene amplification is an infrequent finding in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCCs</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> and does not correlate with protein overexpression </plain></SENT>
