<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have presented a novel external pump perfusion rat model and demonstrated that perfusion with both acid and bile can induce severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 1 week with a similarly pathological change seen in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the histological changes of esophagus after bone marrow cell engraftment with bile and acid perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The external pump perfusion procedure involved implantation of a microosmotic pump for esophageal perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing of the femur marrow, and the cell suspension was injected between the esophageal muscular and inner mucosa layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological changes were determined after 4 weeks of perfusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was seen in both acid and bile perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow engraftment and potentiation was seen in both the acid and bile perfusion, when compared to saline controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Glandular-like cells in submucosa, consistent with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, confirmed by Alcin Blue-<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> staining were observed after bone marrow esophageal implantation along with bile perfusion, but not with acid perfusion and controls </plain></SENT>
