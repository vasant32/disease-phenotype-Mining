<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to correlate clinical and pathologic features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_448'>squamous cell papillomas</z:mpath> of the human esophagus and investigate their pathogenesis and malignant potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and pathologic data on 25 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in whom the race was known were white, and the majority of lesions occurred in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were multiple lesions in five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many cases showed endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No examples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> occurred, and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was seen histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evidence of recurrence was found in only two patients, but several synchronous or metachronous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the <z:chebi fb="39" ids="29287">oro</z:chebi>-respiratory tract occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings do not exclude a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> etiology, they suggest a role for mucosal injury and regeneration in the pathogenesis of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> may be significant </plain></SENT>
