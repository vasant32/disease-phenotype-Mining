<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic findings for procedures performed January 2000-December 2005 for any indication and for reflux-related indications were reviewed by racial group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 280,075 procedures examined, Hispanics were the most likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (Hispanic 19.6%, white 17.3%, black 15.8%, Asian/Pacific Islander 9.5%, P-value&lt;0.0001), and white subjects were most likely to have suspected BE (white 5.0%, Hispanic 2.9%, Asian/Pacific Islander 1.8%, black 1.5%, P-value&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopies performed for reflux-related indications had similar trends for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among reflux/Barrett's screening procedures adjusted for age and gender, Hispanics were most likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (OR=1.28, P-value&lt;0.0001) compared to Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate an association of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and stricture with white patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> with Hispanic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings need to be followed-up with further study </plain></SENT>
