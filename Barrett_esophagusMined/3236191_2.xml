<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>When a colon segment is used for esophageal replacement in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo>, the distal esophageal remnant is often left in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently treated two patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in their esophageal remnants and did not respond to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> and antacids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were treated by esophagectomy at 22 and 37 years of age with relief of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One had an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> and stricture near the gastroesophageal junction and the second had gastric mucosa (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) replacing most of the squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six additional patients were then reviewed who had resection of their distal esophageal segments between 1978 and 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>Esophagitis</z:hpo> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also identified were two specimens with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and four with mural bronchial glands as well as surface respiratory and metaplastic squamous epithelium in two, and cartilagenous remnants in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the esophageal remnant and three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> raise concern about the possible long-term complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we recommend that esophagectomy be performed at the time of esophageal replacement if feasible, or later if symptoms occur or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> studies show <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or ulceration </plain></SENT>
