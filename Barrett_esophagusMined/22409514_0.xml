<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The management of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has clearly changed over recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development is still substantial, with about one in three patients developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, but a number of patients do not develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nature of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> has also been genetically elucidated with more evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> being present at this stage than previously thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapy of the condition has evolved more toward endoscopic therapy, given the good results of radio-frequency ablation and photodynamic therapy in eliminating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and decreasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development in randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The best candidates for treatment include compliant patients that have relatively short segments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, an anatomically straight segment, lack of nodularity, and an intact p16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, even with excellent long-term results similar to surgical resection, the risk of recurrence is present in over 14% of patients, which indicates that there will be a need to continue surveillance endoscopy in these patients </plain></SENT>
