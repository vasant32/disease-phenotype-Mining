<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the in vivo effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> on COX-2 expression in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and no recent history of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic mucosal biopsy specimens were collected at baseline and after 28 days of therapy in a patient treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> 200 mg twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples were analyzed for COX-2 expression by immunoblot analysis with chemiluminescence detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>COX-2 expression was found to decline 20% and 44% at two different biopsy sites compared to the baseline sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Longer exposures revealed a number of previously unidentified proteins above and below the 67 kDa COX-2 protein including 38 kDa and 45 kDa proteins which were present only at study completion consistent with up-regulation after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further investigations of the 38 kDa and 45 kDa proteins were undertaken using two-dimensional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) with immunoblot and MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight) analysis but no matches were found and results were inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unmatched masses from MALDI-TOF <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mass fingerprinting were compared with human COX-2 (67 kDa) and COX-2b (39 kDa) using unspecific cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> sequence homology with COX-2 and COX-2b was found for a length of 19 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on immunodetection, molecular weight and equivical MALDI-TOF results, one of these up-regulated proteins may be COX-2b </plain></SENT>
