<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several classification systems have been launched to characterize <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) mucosa using magnification endoscopy with narrow band imaging (ME-NBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The good accuracy and interobserver agreement described in the early reports were not reproduced subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported somewhat higher accuracy of the classification developed by the Amsterdam group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The critical question then formulated was whether a structured learning program and the level of experience would affect the clinical usefulness of this classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL &amp; METHODS: Two hundred and nine videos were prospectively captured from patients with BE using ME-NBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these, 70 were randomly selected and evaluated by six endoscopists with different levels of expertise, using a dedicated software application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>First, an educational set was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the 70 test videos were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After classification of each video, the respective histological feedback was automatically given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within the learning process, there was a decrease in the time needed for evaluation and an increase in the certainty of prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The accuracy did not increase with the learning process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> ranged between 39% and 57%, and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> between 62% and 90%, irrespective of assessor's expertise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The kappa coefficient for the interobserver agreement ranged from 0.25 to 0.30 for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and from 0.39 to 0.48 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using a dedicated learning program, the ME-NBI Amsterdam classification system is suboptimal in terms of accuracy and inter- and intraobserver agreements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results reiterate the questionable utility of corresponding classification system in clinical routine practice </plain></SENT>
