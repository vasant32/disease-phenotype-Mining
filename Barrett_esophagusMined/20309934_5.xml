<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to determine if repeated exposure to acid and bile confers a tumorigenic phenotype in a telomerase (hTERT)-immortalized benign Barrett's cell line (BAR-T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BAR-T cells were exposed to acid (pH 4) (A) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> (200 μM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36274">glycochenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi>) (B) daily for 5 min up to 65+ weeks </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 46 weeks BAR-T cells exposed to (A+B) showed distinct phenotypic changes: forming clusters and acini, and at 65 weeks displayed foci in monolayer, and formed distinct colonies in soft agar </plain></SENT>
