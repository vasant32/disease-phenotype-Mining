<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had a small sliding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> but the lower esophageal sphincter was located at 39-41 cm </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carbenoxalone <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> administration led to healing in 3 months </plain></SENT>
