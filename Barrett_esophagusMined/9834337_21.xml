<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that short segments of specialized intestinal epithelium are a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and are premalignant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred forty-one patients with reflux symptoms underwent gastroscopy with rigorous biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was diagnosed when specialized intestinal epithelium was present on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were subdivided according to the length of Barrett's mucosa: short-segment Barrett's (&lt;3 cm) and extended Barrett's (&gt; or =3 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Esophageal function was evaluated by manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In another 16 patients with small noncircumferential <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, the endoscopic length of Barrett's mucosa was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients (14%) had short-segment Barrett's and 37 (15%) had extended <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had significantly more acid exposure than patients without specialized intestinal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one percent of patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had increased esophageal acid exposure as did 100% of those with extended <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lengths of Barrett's mucosa were associated with poor esophageal sphincter function and reduced contraction amplitudes in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twelve percent of patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The length of Barrett's mucosa was &gt; or =3 cm in 25% (4 of 16) of patients with early Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further, short segments of specialized intestinal epithelium are premalignant in nature </plain></SENT>
