<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A review of radiology, endoscopy, and pathology files showed 37 patients with reflux symptoms who underwent double-contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> studies and endoscopy with biopsy specimens from the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The radiographic images were reviewed in a blinded fashion and correlated with the endoscopic and histologic findings to determine the radiographic and endoscopic accuracies for detecting reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, using the endoscopic biopsy specimens as the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double-contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> studies and endoscopy had low but comparable accuracies for detecting reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, with sensitivities of 35% and 39%, specificities of 79% and 71%, positive predictive values of 73% and 69%, and negative predictive values of 42% and 41%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When mucosa granularity was evaluated as an individual sign of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> on double-contrast studies, this finding had a sensitivity of 35%, a specificity of 93%, a positive predictive value of 89%, and a negative predictive value of 46% for detecting reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that double-contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> studies and endoscopy have limited ability to detect reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, in particular mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, when using the histologic findings as the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When radiographic abnormalities are detected, however, mucosal granularity is the single best sign of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> on double-contrast studies </plain></SENT>
