<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and its risk factors in patients undergoing endoscopy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal symptoms</z:e> in a Chinese tertiary referral medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive patients receiving an endoscopy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal symptoms</z:e> in our medical center from September to December 2007 were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BE was explored for at endoscopy when a suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the distal esophagus were defined as having BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2022 patients (1053 male and 969 female) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were aged 18 to 88 years and with a mean age of 46.97 +/- 14.84 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BE was found in 21 patients (15 male and 6 female), a prevalence of 1.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients receiving endoscopy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal symptoms</z:e> in our medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the 21 patients had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By logistic multivariate analysis, age (OR 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00, 1.07) and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (OR 4.44; 95% CI, 1.22, 16.17) were factors associated significantly with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of BE in our study was lower than that reported in other studies, especially in studies from developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Older age and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> may be the risk factors for developing BE </plain></SENT>
