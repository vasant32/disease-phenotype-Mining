<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) is defined by the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in biopsies obtained from mucosa with an appearance suggestive of Barrett's that extends &lt;3 cm into the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that this lesion may represent a stage in an ongoing process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If so, then the prevalence of SSBE would be expected to decrease with advancing age, and patients followed over time should exhibit an increase in the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether SSBE length progresses or regresses over time by following a prospective cohort and by assessing the relationship between age and the length, as well as prevalence of SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included consecutive patients who were evaluated prospectively by an upper endoscopy and were found to have SSBE between October, 1983, and December, 1999, at the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a systematic biopsy protocol, and a designated pathologist who reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens confirmed the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were subsequently interviewed for demographic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In those patients who were enrolled into our surveillance program, SSBE length was remeasured and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> reconfirmed on follow-up endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 343 patients with endoscopically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 116 (33.8%) were found to have SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were male (97.4%) and white (85.3%), with a mean age of 60.1+/-1.0 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of SSBE increased with age and reached a plateau during the seventh decade of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One-way analysis of variance showed that there was no significant difference in the mean length of SSBE among the various age groups (p = 0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This trend was maintained when only the white group was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Follow-up endoscopies were performed in 57 patients, revealing a mean interval of 64 months to the latest endoscopy, with no significant difference in SSBE length between the first and last endoscopy (p = 0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SSBE increases with age until the seventh decade of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Finding that SSBE length does not change across the various age groups and during a 64-month mean follow-up, suggests that SSBE does not progress over time </plain></SENT>
