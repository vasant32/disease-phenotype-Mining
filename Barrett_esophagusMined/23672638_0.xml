<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>Celiac disease</z:hpo> (CD) has been linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (GORD) and eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EoE), but population-based studies of the prevalence of CD in these conditions are lacking, that is, the aim of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An endoscopic study was carried out in 1000 randomly selected adults from the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD was defined on the basis of positive serology in parallel with mucosal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002244'>abnormalities of the small intestine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any eosinophil infiltration of the esophageal epithelium was defined as esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and EoE was defined as having at least 15 eosinophils/high-power field in biopsies from the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used Fisher's exact test to compare the prevalence of GORD, esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, and EoE in subjects with CD versus controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four hundred subjects (40%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms (GORS), 155 (15.5%) had erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 16 (1.6%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 48 (4.8%) had esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, and 11 (1.1%) had EoE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD was diagnosed in 8/400 (2.0%) individuals with GORS (vs. controls: 10/600 (1.7%), p = 0.81), in 3/155 (1.9%) with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (vs. 15/845 controls (1.8%), p = 0.75), and in 2/48 (4.2%) individuals with esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> (controls: 16/952 (1.7%), p = 0.21), but in none of those 16 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (vs. 18/984 controls (1.8%), p = 1.0) or of the 11 individuals with EoE (controls: 18/989 (1.8%), p = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This population-based study found no increased risk of CD among individuals with GORD, esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, or EoE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CD screening of individuals with GORD or EoE of individuals with CD cannot be recommended </plain></SENT>
