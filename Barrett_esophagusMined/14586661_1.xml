<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic resection has gained more and more importance in the treatment of early oesophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> over the past few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The choice of the different available techniques depends on the site, the macroscopic type of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and the personal experience of the endoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The "suck-and-cut" technique with ligation device or cap should be favoured over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> strip biopsy in the oesophagus because of the size of the resected specimen and the technical feasibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopic resection (ER) of high-grade intra-epithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> should be considered as the treatment of choice, due to excellent long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First mid-term results of endoscopic therapy of early squamous cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in the oesophagus show promising results; however, long-term results are awaited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ER of oesophageal neoplastic lesions is a safe and effective method but should be performed only by experienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
