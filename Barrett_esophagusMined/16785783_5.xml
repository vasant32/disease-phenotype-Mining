<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>TRAIL/Apo2L is a CD95 ligand-related member of the TNF family that initiates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in immune and neoplastic cells after binding to specific surface receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors previously reported a specific topographic pattern of TRAIL expression in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa and the loss of TRAIL expression in tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> as well as in most colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, they hypothesized that similar changes may occur during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare TRAIL/Apo2L expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastroesophageal (GE) junction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical evaluation of TRAIL expression was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from 29 GE junction/esophageal biopsies, 20 gastric biopsies, 6 esophagectomies, 2 small bowel resection specimens, and 5 colon biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression was graded semiquantitatively on a 4-point scale (0-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TRAIL was expressed in the foveolar epithelium of the histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GE junctional mucosa and stomach as well as in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal epithelium, with maximal expression in the surface epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TRAIL was always detected in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (21/21, 100%), and the overall expression was similar to that of the columnar portion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GE junction (8/8, 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TRAIL was rarely and weakly (1+) expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (3/18, 16.7%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (1/10, 10.0%) (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarities in the topographic pattern of TRAIL expression in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GE junction, stomach, small intestine, and colon suggest a common function of TRAIL throughout the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results show that the downregulation of TRAIL is associated with development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the immunohistochemically detected downregulation of TRAIL expression appears to be a promising indicator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
