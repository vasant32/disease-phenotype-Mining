<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presentation and management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> are changing, as more patients are diagnosed at an earlier stage of the disease in which endoscopic treatment methods may be contemplated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conducted a study to determine whether symptomatic and endoscopic findings can accurately identify node-negative early-stage <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 213 consecutive patients (171 men and 42 women) with resectable esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> seen from 1992 to 2002 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of these patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a multivariable model, model-based probabilities of early-stage disease (T1 im/sm N0) were calculated for each combination of the following three features: no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> as main symptom at presentation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> length &lt;or=2 cm, and noncircumferential lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-two percent of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three characteristics presented with early-stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even in the setting of small, visible, noncircumferential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>/nodules in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, 14% of the patients harbored node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Simple clinical and endoscopic findings predicted early-stage disease in 82% of cases, whereas a small but significant percentage had node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> predisposes to local failure in nonresectional treatment options such as endoscopic mucosal resection and photodynamic therapy, such findings should have a significant bearing on treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
