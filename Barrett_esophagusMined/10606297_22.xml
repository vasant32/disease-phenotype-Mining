<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Demographic, endoscopic, and histological features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at initial diagnosis were examined for their ability to predict complete endoscopic and histological regression of Barrett's during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Barrett's patients who have been followed up for a minimum of 2 yr and who have had at least two follow-up surveillance examinations were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete regression of Barrett's was defined as total disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tongues and patches of Barrett's epithelium at endoscopy (confirmed with Lugol's <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>) in conjunction with only squamous epithelium on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chi2 and stepwise logistic regression analyses were performed on the following clinical, endoscopic, and histological variables with regards to their ability to predict complete Barrett's regression: patient age in years (&lt;65 or &gt; or =65), length in cm of Barrett's (&lt; or =2, &gt;2&lt;6, and &gt; or =6), presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (yes or no), presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at diagnosis (yes or no), and type of long-term medical treatment (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37956">histamine antagonists</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>], or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> and cisapride) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men with a mean age +/- SD in years of 61.6+/-13.1 have been followed prospectively for 24-106 months (mean +/- SD, 48.0+/-19.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients have had complete regression of Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that complete regression of Barrett's was associated only with absence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that complete regression was significantly and independently associated again only with absence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression analysis utilizing only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (yes vs no) and length of Barrett's (&lt;6 cm vs &gt; or =6 cm) as variables revealed that absence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (p = 0.0447) and shorter lengths (&lt;6 cm) of Barrett's (p = 0.0418) were significantly and independently predictive of complete Barrett's regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was noted to be the most important factor associated with Barrett's regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> occurs in a minority of patients, primarily in those with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and shorter lengths of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
