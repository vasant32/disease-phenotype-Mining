<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her-2-targeted therapy has recently been shown to be beneficial for patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her-2 protein expression was investigated in 341 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> [152 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>), 189 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (AC)], 39 cases of Barrett mucosa, and 11 cases of squamous cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HER-2 gene amplification was assessed by colorimetric in-situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive Her-2 status was found in 15.3% of ACs and 3.9% of <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive Her-2-status was more common in dysplastic Barrett mucosas compared with nondysplastic ones (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 26% of the patients with ACs who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=39), the Her-2 status of pretherapeutic biopsies was different compared with subsequent surgical specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant correlation between Her-2 status and patients' survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although Her-2 overexpression is rare in <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCCs</z:mp>, it is found in 15.3% of ACs, where amplification of HER-2 gene and overexpression of Her-2 protein seem to be early events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of Her-2 status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsies and in particular in the context with possible alterations after neoadjuvant treatment can potentially lead to false Her-2-staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although Her-2-overexpression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> seems to have no influence on patients' survival, these subtypes of esophageal ACs have to be considered as targets for an anti-Her-2 therapy </plain></SENT>
