<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim is to establish optical patterns (the rules for interpretation) that correspond to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal histologies of the esophagus, spanning from early benign modifications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) to subsequent dysplastic change and progression toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was achieved by developing an image library categorized by disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We considered morphological changes of disease as they are compared with histological diagnosis of the pathological specimen, as well as control samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, proximal stomach, and small intestine tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our experimental results indicate that UV AF microscopy could provide real-time histological information for visualizing changes in tissue microstructure that are currently undetectable using conventional endoscopic methods </plain></SENT>
