<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing number of patients undergoing endoscopic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (IMC), there are few data to guide clinical decision making and research initiatives in the area of posttreatment follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define expert practice patterns regarding follow-up after endoscopic treatment of BE with HGD and IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Electronic survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Forty-eight endoscopists in the United States with expertise in BE endotherapy based on high-impact publications and national reputation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: A 21-item Web-based survey inquiring about post-BE endotherapy follow-up practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 48 expert endoscopists, 42 completed the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After successful treatment of BE with HGD or IMC, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experts perform surveillance upper endoscopy, most commonly at 3-month intervals in the first posttreatment year, every 6 months during the second year, and annually thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the experts perform surveillance EUS after treatment of HGD, and only 19% perform EUS after treatment of IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> eradication, only 36% of experts refer patients for CT, and 24% refer patients for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight percent of experts refer patients for a surgical opinion when IMC extends into the muscularis mucosa; 100% refer when IMC extends into submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Not a consensus document; only U.S. experts included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the follow-up practices of expert endoscopists after successful endotherapy forÂ BE with HGD and IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional research is necessary to establish optimal surveillance intervals, the role of follow-up EUS, CT, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography, as well as the surgical implications of low-risk IMC extending into the muscularis mucosa </plain></SENT>
