<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MLE was found in 6% of non-Barrett's controls, 30% of Barrett's patients with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 14% of Barrett's patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MLE was significantly associated with shorter lengths of Barrett's epithelium in both Barrett's groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of 5 photodynamic therapy patients were noted to develop MLE after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MLE may be found in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and after photodynamic therapy; its presence is not useful as a prognostic indicator for a more benign course of Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that MLE is significantly associated with shorter lengths of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
