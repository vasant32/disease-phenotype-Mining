<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article focuses on the newly developed Pentax confocal endomicroscope that enables in vivo microscopic imaging of the upper and lower GI tract in histological detail at the time of patient examination without the collection of biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optical imaging technique has the potential to revolutionize clinical workflows in endoscopy through high-resolution fluorescence imaging of cellular and subcellular detail from the surface and subepithelial layers of the GI mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The device incorporates a full screen, high-resolution charge coupled device as well as a confocal microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preliminary data from blinded clinical studies suggests that the use of this device can increase the diagnostic yield for disease detection in conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, where diagnosis using white light endoscopy is problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The early detection and diagnosis of GI abnormalities through the collection of 'optical' biopsies or targeted mucosal excisional biopsies has the potential to improve patient outcomes and enable early therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
