<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since few data are available on epidemiologic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in young persons, we reviewed the case records of patients undergoing esophageal biopsies at Children's Hospital, Boston, from 1982 through 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 1423 esophageal biopsies obtained from 1173 patients, and histological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was present in 397 cases; Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed in 10 patients (0.9% of total and 2.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specialized columnar epithelium was present in seven of these 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of those with Barrett's epithelium was 19.0 +/- 7.9 years (range 3.7-27 years) compared to 8.7 +/- 6.7 years (range 4 days to 31 years) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients biopsied (P less than 0.0001); 80% (8/10) of the Barrett's cases were male compared to 54% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative importance of the possible risk factors was assessed by comparing the 10 patients with Barrett's with the 541 patients that had esophageal biopsies in calendar years 1984-1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>Mental retardation</z:hpo>, a risk factor not previously described for young persons with Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, was present in 70% (7/10) of the Barrett's patients but in only 15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients biopsied (P less than 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> was also higher, but not significantly so (P greater than 0.07), in patients with biopsies that were positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (19%) than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biopsies (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between the Barrett's group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients biopsied in regards to racial origin, prior stricture, or fundoplication </plain></SENT>
