<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The molecular factors contributing to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies showed that BE tissues secrete interleukin-6 (IL-6) and express proteins associated with IL-6 signaling, including IL-6 receptor, activated signal transducer and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), and antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we test the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and gastric acids, two components of refluxate associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastresophageal reflux disease</z:e>, activate the IL-6/STAT3 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to assess levels of phosphorylated STAT3 in esophageal tissue samples from BE patients with different grades of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seg-1 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells were evaluated for STAT3 activation and IL-6 and Bcl-x(L) expression by molecular biology techniques, including Western blot, reverse transcription-PCR, and ELISA after exposure to control media (pH 7.4), media supplemented with a 0.1 mmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> cocktail with media at pH 4 or media at pH 4 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> cocktail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis showed that activated, phosphorylated STAT3 is expressed in nuclei of dysplastic BE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Seg-1 cells with media containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> cocktail and acidified to pH 4 resulted in increased activation of STAT3, IL-6 secretion, and increased expression of Bcl-x(L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the STAT3 pathway using STAT3 small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> or Janus-activated kinase inhibitor resulted in <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The IL-6/STAT3 antiapoptotic pathway is induced by short exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> cocktail and low pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This alteration, if persistent in vivo, may underlie the development of dysplastic BE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
