<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many otherwise healthy individuals with episodic heartburn self-medicate with over-the-counter antacids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated clinical characteristics of subjects who had never been medically diagnosed as having any upper gastrointestinal tract disorder and who used antacids for symptomatic relief of heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects with at least 3 months of frequent heartburn relieved by antacids, and with heartburn on at least 4 of 7 days during the week prior to study entry, had their medical history and gastrointestinal pathological characteristics recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tests included esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophageal motility and sensitivity studies, and 24-hour pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 178 subjects screened, 13 were excluded on the basis of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal diseases</z:e> at baseline, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014863" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diffuse esophageal spasm</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease, dysplastic columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten subjects were ineligible because of insufficient baseline heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 155 eligible subjects had heartburn for an average of 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven percent had daily symptoms and 70% described heartburn severity as moderate, even though on endoscopy most (53%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing esophageal mucosa (grade 0 or 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophageal acid sensitivity was present in 86% of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean lower esophageal sphincter pressures and esophageal contractile amplitudes were at the lower limits of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and total esophageal acid contact time was slightly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> heartburn can reflect a wide range of diagnostic findings, including important underlying pathological features, and may warrant a full medical examination to detect such abnormal conditions and to permit selection of appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
