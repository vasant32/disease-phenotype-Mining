<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic trimodal imaging (ETMI) may improve detection of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies with ETMI so far have been performed in tertiary referral settings only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare ETMI with standard video endoscopy (SVE) for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in BE patients with an intermediate-risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Community practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: BE patients with confirmed low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (LGIN) underwent both ETMI and SVE in random order (interval 6-16 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During ETMI, BE was inspected with high-resolution endoscopy followed by autofluorescence imaging (AFI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> visible lesions were then inspected with narrow-band imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During ETMI and SVE, visible lesions were sampled followed by 4-quadrant random biopsies every 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Overall histological yield of ETMI and SVE and targeted histological yield of ETMI and SVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 99 patients (79 men, 63Â±10 years) underwent both procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ETMI had a significantly higher targeted histological yield because of additional detection of 22 lesions with LGIN/high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN)/<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (Ca) by AFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the overall histological yield (targeted+random) between ETMI and SVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HGIN/Ca was diagnosed only by random biopsies in 6 of 24 patients and 7 of 24 patients, with ETMI and SVE, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Inspection, with high-resolution endoscopy and AFI, was performed sequentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ETMI performed in a community-based setting did not improve the overall detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> compared with SVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is still being made in a significant number of patients by random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of LGIN have a significant risk of HGIN/Ca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>(Clinical trial registration number: ISRCTN91816824; NTR867.) </plain></SENT>
