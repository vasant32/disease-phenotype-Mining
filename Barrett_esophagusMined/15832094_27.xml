<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), a relatively new endoluminal therapeutic technique with low morbidity and no mortality reported to date, is advocated for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE)-related superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies revise its success downward, particularly regarding the ability to achieve complete excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate what remains an evolving technique, we analyzed our experience with a series of 27 esophageal EMRs (20 lesions in 18 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to evaluate the diagnostic, staging, and therapeutic advantages of EMR separately by correlating the initial biopsies and pre-EMR endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) staging with the final histologic diagnoses and stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persistence/recurrence of neoplastic tissue was also correlated with the margin status of the resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, which included low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> (n=2), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> (n=8), intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (n=14), and submucosal invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (n=3), was 11 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EUS correctly reported an intramucosal or submucosal lesion in 70% of the cases while it overstaged 18% and understaged 12% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The biopsy diagnosis corresponded to the EMR diagnosis in 63% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The biopsy underestimated the grade of the lesion in 21% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EMR revealed a lower histologic grade compared with the biopsy in 16% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The resection was microscopically complete in only 4% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No residual/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> was observed in 10 lesions (9 patients) at 4 to 63 months (mean, 23 months) post-EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, 9 lesions (8 patients) persisted/recurred 28 days to 25 months (mean, 6 months) after treatment; 56% of the cases with positive lateral margin(s) and negative deep margin persisted/recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, 86% of the EMRs with positive deep margin showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e>/recurrence on follow-up biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we observed that EMR offers improved diagnosis and staging as compared with biopsy and EUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This is a significant advantage since it can modify patients' management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, frequent incompleteness of resection and high persistence/recurrence are significant pitfalls that dictate continued endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
