<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five examples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 8 Meckel's diverticula, and 2 small <z:hpo ids='HP_0100668'>bowel duplications</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although G cells were absent in the gastric mucosa from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of Barett's esophagus, four Meckel's diverticula and one small <z:hpo ids='HP_0100668'>bowel duplication</z:hpo> contained G cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances of congenitally derived ectopic gastric mucosa where G cells were demonstrable, the gastric mucosa showed areas of antropyloric differentiation, whereas in the remaining cases the ectopic gastric mucosa was exclusively of the body-fundic type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the presence of G cells within ectopic gastric mucosa of Meckel's diverticula and small <z:hpo ids='HP_0100668'>bowel duplications</z:hpo> in foci of antropyloric differentiation reflects their developmental origin, whereas the absence of G cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is in keeping with its metaplastic derivation </plain></SENT>
