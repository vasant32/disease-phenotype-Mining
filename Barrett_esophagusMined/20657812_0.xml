<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In clinical settings, the term biomarker generally refers to a molecular marker produced by tissues whose detection heralds a diseased state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, there are at least three clinical settings in which the use of molecular biomarkers has been proposed including 1) stratifying the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>, 2) serving as an adjunct to aid in the diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 3) predicting response to ablative therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the routine clinical use of biomarkers in any of these clinical settings is not yet recommended, it seems reasonable to assume that biomarker validation studies will be carried out in the coming years and that movement into the clinics will be inevitable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the current progress in using biomarkers in each of the clinical settings described above with a focus on the molecular biomarkers which have advanced the farthest toward use in routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
