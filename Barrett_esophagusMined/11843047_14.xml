<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While there is evidence that physiological data correlate poorly with quality-of-life data or patient-perceived symptom severity, most outcome studies of antireflux surgery still refer physiologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to establish whether concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0010994'>aerophagia</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>) patients might influence the surgical outcome of laparoscopic 'floppy' Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 112 patients were divided into 2 subgroups: group 1 comprising <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0010994'>aerophagia</z:mp> (n = 94; 84%); group 2 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0010994'>aerophagia</z:mp> (n = 28; 16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, requirements for surgery included an evaluation of symptoms (list of 17 symptoms; patients' grading from no--mild to moderate--severe), quality of life (Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index: GIQLI), esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophageal manometry and 24-h pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we asked for any potential stress relations to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical outcome was assessed 3 months and 1 year postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group 2 patients before surgery, we found a significantly higher percentage with a mild impairment of esophageal motility, with a subjectively and objectively dominant reflux in the upright position, with a lower grading of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and with a stronger belief that stress was in any relation to perceived symptoms compared with group 1 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these patients perceived typical and untypical symptoms more intensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors such as DeMeester score and lower esophageal sphincter pressure did not differ preoperatively, the same as after antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both groups profit significantly from surgery-a continuous reduction of symptom severity and quality-of-life improvement was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group 1 patients showed an improvement in mean GIQLI from 93.4+/-8.3 points preoperatively to 123.1+/-7.3 and 122.9+/-9.0 points 3 months and 1 year postoperatively, whereas group 2 patients demonstrated a lower outcome, from 82.2+/-9.1 points to 112.4+/-8.1 and 116.8+/-7.9 points postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This lesser improvement is the result of preoperative symptoms such as belching, <z:mp ids='MP_0009247'>bloating</z:mp> or flatulence, which many patients had after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, some of the group 2 patients suffered from subjective mild to moderate heartburn or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, but without any objective correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0010994'>aerophagia</z:mp> demonstrated less symptomatic relief than patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0010994'>aerophagia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010994'>aerophagia</z:mp> showed less quality-of-life improvement after laparoscopic antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in physiological outcome data between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Surgery in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with symptoms relating to <z:mp ids='MP_0010994'>aerophagia</z:mp> should be approached with great care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>An additional psychological intervention in these patients might improve surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
