<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> resections performed between September 2000 and March 2006 with the ER-cap technique in patients with BE were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complications were classified '<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>' (during the procedure) or 'early' (&lt; 48 h after the procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 216 ER-cap procedures were performed in 121 patients, of which 145 were performed with a standard hard cap and 71 with a large flexible cap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens removed with the standard cap had a mean diameter of 20 mm (SD 5.0) versus 23 mm (SD 5.8) for the large cap (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> were classified as severe complications and treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
