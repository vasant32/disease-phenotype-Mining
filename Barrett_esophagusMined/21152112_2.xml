<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over the past two decades, the bulk of gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic procedures has shifted away from diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for symptomatic disease toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This shift has resulted largely from a decrease in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease in the era of antisecretory medications coupled with emerging evidence for the efficacy of endoscopic detection and eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, a histopathological biomarker widely accepted as a precursor to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This shift has been accompanied by a drive toward minimally-invasive, in situ optical diagnostic technologies that help assess the mucosa for cellular changes that relate to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two competing but complementary approaches have been pursued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first approach is based on broad-view targeting of "areas of interest" or "red flags." These broad-view technologies include standard white light endoscopy (WLE), high-definition endoscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), and "electronic" chromoendoscopy (narrow-band-type imaging) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second approach is based on multiple small area or point-source (meso/micro) measurements, which can be either machine (spectroscopy) or human-interpreted (endomicroscopy, magnification endoscopy), much as histopatholgy slides are </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this paper we present our experience with the development and testing of a set of familiar but "smarter" standard tissue-sampling tools that can be routinely employed during screening/surveillance endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These tools have been designed to incorporate fiberoptic probes that can mediate spectroscopy or endomicroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the value of such tools by assessing their preliminary performance from several ongoing clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results have shown promise for a new generation of integrated optical tools for a variety of screening/surveillance applications during GI endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Integrated devices should prove invaluable for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> surveillance strategies that currently result in large numbers of benign biopsies, which are of little clinical consequence, including screening for colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and surveillance of "flat" <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
