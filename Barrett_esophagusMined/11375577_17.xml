<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to delineate the clinical epidemiology of the CIP, especially its possible relationship to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study compared 53 case subjects with CIP and 4882 control subjects without CIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate logistic regression, the presence of CIP was chosen as the outcome variable, whereas demographic characteristics, social habits, and presence of other endoscopic diagnoses served as predictor variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of CIP was 1.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its presence was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (odds ratio 2.26: 95% CI [1.12, 4.56]) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcer</z:hpo> (2.93: 95% CI [1.34, 6.40]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (4.41: 95% CI [2.31, 8.41]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The coincidence of the cervical inlet patch and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> could suggest a shared embryonic etiology </plain></SENT>
