<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may present as a cellular mosaic with irregular longitudinal extensions of intestinal epithelium, spotty areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and other intermediate markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may not be possible to detect and reproducibly localize these findings with routine endoscopic biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A more systematic biopsy protocol is necessary for chemopreventive studies to be feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Utilizing an adapted upper endoscope that allows accurate evaluation of distance from the incisors and rotatory position, chromoendoscopy with toluidine blue and systematic mapping (4 quadrant jumbo biopsies at 1 cm intervals) were performed twice on 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (second procedure 1 to 3 months after baseline study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsy specimens were subjected to routine and immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry to create baseline and follow-up maps for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 18 patients also underwent standard surveillance biopsies within 6 months of the systematic mapping procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Epithelium type was reproducibly identified with 94% accuracy on second endoscopic maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ploidy, p53, and Ki-67 status were also reproducibly identified on second endoscopic maps (97%, 89%, and 85%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was found in 7 of 18 patients at similar sites at each mapping procedure (3 patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 4 with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of the patients who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on mapping had also undergone standard surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was missed in 2 of 3 patients and 1 patient with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had only low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detected with standard biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing a modified gastroscope and this methodology, we reliably located sites of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and other biomarkers within a field of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients had variable areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> that were missed on standard endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
