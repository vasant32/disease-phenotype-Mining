<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether Mucin-2 is a good substitute for <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-alcian blue in the detection of goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Biopsy specimens from 47 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients were stained with hematoxylineosin and <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-alcian blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mucin-2 expression was evaluated with monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intra- and interobserver agreements about the expression of Mucin-2 and <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-alcian blue stain were determined by kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-alcian blue and Mucin-2 were positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mucin expression was positive in goblet cells and few columnar cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-alcian blue showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The columnar epithelium and the submucosal glands were also stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intra- and interobserver agreement in the identification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mucin-2 agreed fully with <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-alcian blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intra- and interobserver agreement was perfect, justifying its use in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
