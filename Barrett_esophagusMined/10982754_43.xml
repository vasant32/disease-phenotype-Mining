<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> has been resolution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> at the genetic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Archival material from 3 patients who had initial improvement in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> but occurrence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> during follow-up was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were analyzed for increased proliferation, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, p53 protein overexpression, p53 mutations, and p16 promoter hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> 16, 28, and 37 months after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, one or more genetic markers were positive after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> treatment, whereas histology was downstaged consistently after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing genetic abnormalities were noted by the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic abnormalities may persist after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> despite phenotypical improvement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients may progress to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or develop <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologic improvement in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is an inadequate endpoint for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
