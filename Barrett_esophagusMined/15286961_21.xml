<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surveillance programmes for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> have been implemented in an effort to detect oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at an earlier and potentially curable stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the impact of endoscopic surveillance on the clinical outcome of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> complicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Consecutive patients who underwent oesophageal resection for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathological stage and survival of patients identified as part of a surveillance programme were compared with those of patients presenting with symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients in the surveillance group and 74 in the non-surveillance group underwent oesophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease detected in the surveillance programme was at a significantly earlier stage: 13 of 17 versus 11 of 74 stage 0 or I, three versus 26 stage II, and one versus 37 stage III or IV (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024232" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lymphatic metastases</z:e> were seen in three of 17 patients in the surveillance group and 42 of 74 who were not under surveillance (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three-year survival was 80 and 31 per cent respectively (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with surveillance-detected <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus are diagnosed at an earlier stage and have a better prognosis than those who present with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
