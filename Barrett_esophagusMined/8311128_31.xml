<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiologic effect of duodenal contents in the refluxed gastric juice of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the composition of the refluxed gastric juice in 43 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and 52 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> using a newly developed device that allows ambulatory esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings were correlated with the results of 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring and the presence of complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with bile concentrations in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers, the total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentration in the reflux aspirates was higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentration in the aspirates and the percentage of time the pH was above 7 on ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring (r = 0.59, p = 0.006), and both were highest during the night (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentration and the percentage of time pH was greater than 7 were particularly increased in patients with strictures or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both an increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentration in aspirates and the percentage of time with pH greater than 7 on pH monitoring were observed primarily in patients with a destroyed gastroduodenal barrier [status post Billroth II resection (BII), Billroth I resection (BI), or pyloroplasty] or after cholecystectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentration also occurred in a substantial number of patients without previous foregut surgery, although this did not usually result in an increase in the time that pH was above 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that contamination of the refluxed gastric juice with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> predisposes the patient to the development of strictures and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increased time that pH is greater than 7 on esophageal pH monitoring indicates biliary reflux and occurs primarily after previous foregut surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-time pH above 7 does, however, not exclude contamination of the refluxed gastric juice with duodenal contents </plain></SENT>
