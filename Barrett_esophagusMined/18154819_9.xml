<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic procedures may represent an alternative to esophagectomy for superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of the esophagus (T1m/T1sm), but they are considered curative only in case of no lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the most accurate method to define both T and N staging of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aims of the study were to assess the staging accuracy of EUS in superficial lesions (T1m and T1sm) of patients who were candidates for esophagectomy or local endoscopic resection and to establish which variables (site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, histologic type, macroscopic appearance) can affect the accuracy of EUS in distinguishing between T1m and T1sm lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 55 patients with superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus who underwent EUS (October 2002 to January 2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic ultrasound features were compared with findings from surgical specimens or samples obtained at mucosectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 33 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (60%), which developed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 27 cases, 21 patients (38%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, and 1 (2%) with lymphoepithelial-like <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were confirmed as T1 on pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 22 (40%) T1m lesions on EUS, 19 (86%) were confirmed as T1m on pathology; of the 33 T1sm on EUS, 22 (66%) were confirmed as T1sm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positive predictive value of EUS for invasion of the submucosa was 67%, negative predictive value 86%, sensitivity 88%, specificity 63%, and diagnostic accuracy 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of EUS in evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> was 71%, with a negative predictive value of 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic ultrasound accuracy in differentiating mucosal from submucosal lesions increased from the lower esophagus or gastroesophageal junction to the mid and upper esophagus (71%, 76%, and 100%, respectively; not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As for the histologic type, accuracy was 70% for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 81% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, (not significant); for lesions detected as type 0-IIa (13 patients), accuracy was 100%; for type 0-I lesions (23 patients), accuracy was 70% (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite difficulties in differentiating mucosal from submucosal lesions, even with 20-MHz miniprobes, EUS remains an extremely valuable tool when nonsurgical treatments are considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Its staging accuracy depends on site and macroscopic appearance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
