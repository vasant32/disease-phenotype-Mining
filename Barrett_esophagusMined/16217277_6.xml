<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential usefulness of these techniques in renal tissues and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> has not been described to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This initial study examined the feasibility of using fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to differentiate between malignant and benign renal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ex vivo study was conducted to identify optical characteristics of various renal tissue types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathologically confirmed benign and malignant renal samples were obtained from nephrectomy specimens from patients undergoing radical nephrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectra were measured from benign and malignant renal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> renal tissues, malignant or benign, contain 2 primary emission peaks-a strong one at approximately 285 nm excitation, approximately 340 nm emission (Peak A), and a weak one at approximately 340 nm excitation, approximately 460 nm emission (Peak B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peak A of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal tissue typically locates at the shorter excitation wavelength region than that of malignant tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intensity of Peak B from benign tissues tends to be greater than that from malignant renal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diffuse reflectance intensities from malignant renal tissues between 600 and 800 nm are markedly greater than those from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Empirical discrimination algorithms developed based on selected fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectral characteristics yields accurate differentiation between benign and malignant renal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Highly accurate differentiation between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human renal tissues and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007134" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">renal cell cancers</z:e> is feasible using combined fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in an ex vivo setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If successful in future clinical studies, optical spectroscopy could aid in margin detection and tissue discrimination while performing nephron sparing surgery </plain></SENT>
