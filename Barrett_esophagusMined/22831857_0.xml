<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is effective for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) but often involves multiple endoscopy sessions over several months to achieve complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Identify structural markers that correlate with treatment response by using 3-dimensional (3-D) optical coherence tomography (OCT; 3-D OCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Thirty-three patients, 32 male and 1 female, with short-segment (&lt;3 cm) BE undergoing RFA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Patients were treated with focal RFA, and 3-D OCT was performed at the gastroesophageal junction before and immediately after the RFA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were re-examined with standard endoscopy 6 to 8 weeks later and had biopsies to rule out BE if not visibly evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The thickness of BE epithelium before RFA and the presence of residual gland-like structures immediately after RFA were determined by using 3-D OCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of BE at follow-up was assessed endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE mucosa was significantly thinner in patients who achieved complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> than in patients who did not achieve complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at follow-up (257 ± 60 μm vs 403 ± 86 μm; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A threshold thickness of 333 μm derived from receiver operating characteristic curves corresponded to a 92.3% sensitivity, 85% specificity, and 87.9% accuracy in predicting the presence of BE at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of OCT-visible glands immediately after RFA also correlated with the presence of residual BE at follow-up (83.3% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 90.6% accuracy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Single center, cross-sectional study in which only patients with short-segment BE were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional OCT assessment of BE thickness and residual glands during RFA sessions correlated with treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional OCT may predict responses to RFA or aid in making real-time RFA retreatment decisions in the future </plain></SENT>
