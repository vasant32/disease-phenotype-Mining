<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 671 patients assessed for symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, 459 were included in a prospective study, practicing esophagogastroscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24-hour pH-metry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risks of presenting a pathologic DeMeester score or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were estimated according to different values for the lower esophageal sphincter parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk of a pathologic DeMeester score only increased when pressure was less than 6 mm Hg, total length was less than 2 cm, or abdominal length was less than 1 cm; regardless of which parameter was affected, the risk being greater when the three parameters were altered (odds ratio=2.4, 3.1, and 4 for one, two, and three altered parameters) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male sex, sphincter pressure, and DeMeester score were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05) but not total or abdominal length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pressure and total and abdominal lengths have a similar influence over establishing the risk of pathologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, but only pressure may indicate the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
