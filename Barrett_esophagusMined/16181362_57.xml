<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The association between overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further, the association between body fat distribution and the risk of BE is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study in patients who underwent endoscopy at a single large VA Medical Center between 2000 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were patients with documented BE who had an abdominal CT scan within 1 yr of the endoscopy, whereas controls were patients without BE (with or without erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>) who also had an abdominal CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surface areas of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were calculated from CT scan images at level of intervertebral disc between L4 and L5, and body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2 at the time of endoscopy was also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases and controls were compared in univariate and multivariable analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 36 cases and 93 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between cases and controls in age (mean 63 yr), gender (98% men), or race (71% white Caucasian) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BMI was significantly greater in cases than controls (27 vs 24; p= 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BMI &gt;30 kg/m2 was associated with a greater risk of BE than lower BMI (odds ratio 4.0; 95% CI: 1.4-11.1, p= 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VAT was approximately 1.5-fold greater in cases than controls (183 vs 115 cm2; p &lt; 0.0001), whereas SAT was less different (248 vs 200 cm2; p= 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We estimated that each 10-cm2 increase in VAT was associated with 9% increase in risk of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, VAT remained independently associated with BE in the model that adjusted for BMI, and in that model, BMI was not significantly associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> seems to be associated with an increased risk of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Abdominal visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> might mediate most of this risk </plain></SENT>
