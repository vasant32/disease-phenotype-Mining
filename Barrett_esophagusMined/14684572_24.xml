<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: It is known that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> can induce mucosal injury, stimulate cell proliferation, and promote <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A large body of genetic and biochemical evidence indicate that the biosynthetic pathway of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) may play an important role in human and rodent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the expression pattern of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), COX-2, and microsomal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E synthase 1 (mPGES-1), as well as EP receptor subtypes in rat oesophageal lesions induced by duodenal contents reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Oesophagoduodenal anastomosis was performed in rats to induce duodenal contents reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined histological changes and expression of COX-1, COX-2, mPGES-1, and EP receptor subtypes in the oesophagus by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> control oesophageal tissues showed COX-1 expression in subepithelial stromal cells, including endothelial cells and muscular cells, and did not reveal expression of COX-2 or mPGES-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of squamous cell lesions, immunoreactivity of COX-1 was similar to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lesions, and COX-2 was maximally expressed around the vascular papillae of tissues showing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and surrounding epithelial layer and basal layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>mPGES-1 was highly expressed in stromal cells with COX-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, COX-2 and mPGES-1 were predominantly in subepithelial stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of COX-2, mPGES-1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 were higher in the experimental groups than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the biosynthetic pathway of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> may play an important role in oesophageal squamous cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_165'>glandular metaplasia</z:mpath> induced by duodenal contents reflux </plain></SENT>
