<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Fundoplication is widely used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether it diminishes the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) is, however, controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to define, at the national level in Finland, frequency and predisposing factors for post-fundoplication EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For this population-based study from 1980 to 2006, Finland's administrative databases provided preliminary data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of EAC patient records (N = 1035) led us to include those with preceding antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conservatively treated patients were not analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EAC incidence in patients with antireflux surgery was compared with that in the general population (1987-2006) by means of standardized incidence ratio (SIR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 53 (5.1%) EAC patients had undergone antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these patients with male predominance (74%), preoperatively 41 (77%) had developed endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 40 (75%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, 24 (45%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), nine (17%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction, and three (6%) stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, histologically confirmed BE was present in 42 (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Antireflux surgery had preceded EAC at a mean interval of 10.1 years (range 0.5-25.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This interval was significantly (p=0.02) shorter in patients with long-term functioning fundoplication (n = 15; 30%) at EAC diagnosis (6.4 years, range 0.5-15.2 years) than in those (n = 22, 44%) with failure (11.2 years, range 4.0-24.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, the SIR for EAC after antireflux surgery (1987-2006) was 9.21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intention-to-treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with antireflux surgery does not prevent EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It often develops more than 5 years postoperatively, also in the patients with a good antireflux barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only one-third of the patients had, however, a functioning fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Preoperative BE and endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> may be risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Prospective, long-term, randomized studies in experienced centers may reveal the definite effect of antireflux surgery on EAC development </plain></SENT>
