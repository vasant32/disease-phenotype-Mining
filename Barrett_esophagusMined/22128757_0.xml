<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has also been consistently found to be a strong risk factor for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of GER appears to vary; however, population-based Australian studies investigating the symptoms are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to estimate the population prevalence and identify the determinants of frequent GER symptoms in the Australian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Self-reported information on the frequency of reflux symptoms were collected from 1,580 adults from a population register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We estimated age- and sex-standardized prevalence of occasional (&lt;weekly) and frequent (≥weekly) GER symptoms in the Australian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) for GER symptoms associated with demographic and lifestyle characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The standardized prevalences of GER symptoms were 10.4% and 38.3% for frequent and occasional symptoms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with participants with body mass index &lt;25, those with body mass index ≥35 had almost 90% higher prevalence of frequent GER symptoms (PR 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-3.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the prevalence of frequent GER symptoms was significantly higher among regular users of aspirin or other <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> than never users (PR 1.71; 95%CI 1.08-3.16) and regular consumers of medium to well-done barbecued meat (PR 1.75; 95%CI 1.10-2.80) or fried food (PR 2.69; 95%CI 1.66-4.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of frequent GER symptoms was significantly lowered with regular physical activity (PR 0.46; 95%CI 0.32-0.66) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> (PR 0.53; 95%CI 0.35-0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence that frequent GER symptoms were associated with smoking, alcohol, spicy food, or coffee consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that GER symptoms are common and that frequent GER symptoms are associated with a range of modifiable lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
