<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent of disease in patients with pT1 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of a limited surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Radical esophagectomy with systematic lymphadenectomy is widely advocated as the treatment of choice in patients with early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This approach, however, is associated with substantial complications and long-term side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of resection necessary to achieve cure in such patients is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-one patients with pT1 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal esophagus underwent transmediastinal or transthoracic esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients with uT1N0 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> underwent a limited resection of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction, regional lymphadenectomy, and reconstruction by interposition of an isoperistaltic pedicled jejunal segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two groups were compared for extent and multicentricity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and associated high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e>, complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and outcome of surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multicentric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> or associated high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was observed in 60.6% of the resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and the entire segment with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, irrespective of the surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing limited resection had fewer complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lymph node metastases</z:e> or micrometastases were present in none of the 38 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> limited to the mucosa (pT1a) versus 10 of the 56 (17.9%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> invading the submucosa (pT1b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> occurred only in patients with more than three positive regional lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lymph node metastases</z:e> were prognostic, but the pT1a/pT1b category and the surgical approach were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index after limited resection did not differ from that of healthy controls: 20 of the 24 patients were completely asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the distal esophagus, resection of the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction, with regional lymphadenectomy and jejunal interposition, is an attractive limited surgical alternative to radical esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
