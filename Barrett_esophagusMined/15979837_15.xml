<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine COX2 expression and its relation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, Ki67 and Bcl2 expression in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Specimens from 48 R0-resected Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were immunostained for cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), CD 31 and alpha-sm actin to discriminate between mature and immature vessels, Mib-1 and Bcl2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>COX2 staining, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, Ki67 expression and Bcl2 expression were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: COX2 expression was increased in 25 of 48 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between COX2 expression and age, sex and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between lymph node positive cases and elevated COX2 expression (p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of Ki67 positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells was 43.8% (range 15.4-67.5%) in the low COX2 group and 57.8% (range 12.0-84.6%) in the high COX2 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference was statistically significant (p=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median neovascularisation coefficient in the low COX2 group was 11.68 (range 8.22-43.64) and 25.47 (range 8-38.3) in the high COX2 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference was statistically significant (p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in survival was observed between patients in the COX2 low category when compared with the COX2 high category (log-rank test p=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated COX2 expression is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph-node metastases</z:e> and reduced survival in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This appears to be related to the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and proliferation </plain></SENT>
