<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fas ligand (FasL) has been shown to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cells expressing its receptor Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that Fas ligand is overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, and in a few cases of BM negative with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to determine the status of Fas expression in BM with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections from esophageal biopsies and esophagectomy specimens with BM, with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, were immunostained for Fas and FasL using the immunoperoxidase technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of positive cells in each case was evaluated and compared with the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When Fas expression was assessed in glands with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath>, Fas immunoreactivity was either undetected or present in less than 10% of the cells in 85% of the cases, and only 1 (4%) of the 28 cases examined showed Fas immunoreactivity in more than 25% of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we compared Fas expression in goblet cell-containing glands with glands of gastric cardia phenotype, we found that in the 26 cases of BM with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> Fas was completely undetectable in goblet cell-containing glands in 15 (58%) of the cases but was undetectable in only 3 (12%) of the glands with gastric cardia phenotype (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fas is usually undetectable or is expressed at a low level in BM with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fas expression in goblet cell-containing glands is less frequent than in glands with gastric cardia phenotype in the same specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BM with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> overexpress FasL, so decreased Fas expression may protect BM with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> from self-destruction while allowing them to evade immune surveillance </plain></SENT>
