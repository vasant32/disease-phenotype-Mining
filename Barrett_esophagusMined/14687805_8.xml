<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Accurate measurements of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> length are important in clinical follow-up as well as in studies of therapeutic intervention in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate both the inter- and intraobserver reliability in measuring Barrett's length during two consecutive endoscopies by either the same or different experienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between Barrett's mucosa length and the absolute change in Barrett's length measurements on a follow-up endoscopy was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 96 Barrett's patients underwent two consecutive endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was confirmed by the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> length was carefully measured and recorded during the two endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedures were performed by only two experienced endoscopists, who were not aware of previous endoscopic measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only patients with long-segment (&gt; or =3 cm) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 55 patients who had their consecutive endoscopies performed by the same endoscopist had a mean 1.6-cm difference between the two measurements as compared to 1.4 cm in the 41 patients who had their endoscopies performed by different endoscopists (p = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The agreement between the two Barrett's length measurements was high in both groups, although it was slightly higher for endoscopies performed by the same endoscopist (r = 0.79 vs r = 0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis of the absolute change in Barrett's length between the two endoscopic measurements and Barrett's mucosa length demonstrated a significant relationship (r = 0.28, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For every 1-cm increase in the mean length of Barrett's mucosa, a 0.15-cm increase in the absolute difference between two consecutive endoscopic measurements of Barrett's length was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Consecutive measurements of Barrett's length performed by different experienced endoscopists or by the same experienced endoscopist demonstrated a high degree of agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A range of variability in Barrett's length measurement was determined (+/-1.4-1.6 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>True regression or progression of Barrett's mucosa should be considered only if the change is greater than the range of variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, endoscopists should be well aware that the longer the Barrett's mucosa the greater the absolute difference in Barrett's length measurement on follow-up endoscopy </plain></SENT>
