<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three consecutive patients with idiopathic gastric acid hypersecretion (defined as a basal acid output &gt; 10.0 meq/hr with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting serum gastrin level and negative secretin stimulation test) who were being treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo> disease and other acid-peptic disorders were evaluated for the presence of Helicobacter pylori by means of a rapid urease test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo> and 19 had other acid-peptic disorders (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in 14, including six with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; four with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nonulcer dyspepsia</z:e>; and one with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Helicobacter pylori was present in 12 of the 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> patients (86%) compared to only two of the 19 nonulcer patients (11%) (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of basal acid output for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo> was similar to that for nonulcer patients, and no significant difference in the mean basal acid output was found among Helicobacter pylori-positive compared to Helicobacter pylori-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo> patients with a basal acid output greater than 15.0 meq/hr were Helicobacter pylori-positive, suggesting that the organism can withstand even extreme levels of gastric acidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo> disease associated with idiopathic gastric acid hypersecretion is not different from a majority of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> acid secretory profiles and offers additional evidence that extreme levels of gastric acid are not bactericidal for the organism </plain></SENT>
