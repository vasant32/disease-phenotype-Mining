<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, observational, longitudinal, pre and post-procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CENTERS: Beneficencia Española, Hospital Angeles, and Hospital Francisco Galindo Chávez, ISSSTE, in Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: From December 1992 to February 1999, 100 patients with surgical indications due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) prospectively underwent a laparoscopic Nissen-Rossetti procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clinical and endoscopic follow up from 3 months to 9 years was performed in 87 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptomatic control was achieved in 98% (85/87) of the cases and remission of overall endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 79% (69/87); excluding Barrett cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> remission was observed in 93% (67/72) of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following recurrences took place: two with G-II and two with G-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, one requiring pyloroplasty due <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152020" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric stasis</z:e>, and other patient with G-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, who has needed to continue with postoperative dilations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 16 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, two-showed remission and one did not return control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perioperative complications included gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> (3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> during the immediate postoperative period (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (1), and late esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were resolved satisfactorily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical mortality was 0 in the 100 cases undergoing the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six percent of cases had a 24-h hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early morbidity: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in 60 patients, early satiety in 91 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distention</z:hpo> in 25 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> this symptomatology disappears during the subsequent 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Persistent morbidity: flatulence in 60% of patients, difficulty for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> in 10% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The laparoscopic procedure is as effective as the open method with the advantage of being minimally invasive </plain></SENT>
