<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The malignant potential of Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is evidenced by ultimate progression of this condition to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We utilized liquid phase separation of proteins with chromatofocusing in the first dimension and nonporous reverse phase HPLC in the second dimension followed by ESI-TOF mass spectrometry to identify proteins differentially expressed in six Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> samples as compared with six esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> samples; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six Barrett samples were obtained from the identical six patients from whom we obtained the esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Approximately 300 protein bands were detected by mass mappings, and 38 differentially expressed proteins were identified by microLC-MS/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The false positive rates of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> identifications were evaluated by reversed database searching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the proteins that were identified, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2, alpha-enolase, Lamin A/C, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16862">nucleoside-diphosphate</z:chebi> kinase A were demonstrated to be up-regulated in both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> relative to Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Candidate proteins were examined at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level using high density oligonucleotide microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cellular expression patterns were verified in both esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and in Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differentially expressed proteins may have utility as useful candidate markers of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
