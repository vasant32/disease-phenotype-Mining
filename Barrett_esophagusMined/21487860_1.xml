<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of the PPGAP remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is also unclear whether change in the PPGAP may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aims to analyze the presence of PPGAP in patients submitted to Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients who had a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (mean age = 61 years, 13 females, mean time from operation 1 year) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were free of foregut symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent high-resolution manometry to identify the location of the lower border of the lower esophageal sphincter (LBLES).Station pull-through pH monitoring was performed from 5 cm below the LBLES to the LBLES in increments of 1 cm in a fasting state and 10 min after a standardized fatty meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patterns of gastric acidity were found: (1) acid was not detected in the studied area of the stomach in 8 (53%) patients; (2) constant acidity (stomach is not alkalinized after meal), i.e., a buffered layer was not found in 3 (20%) patients; (3) PPGAP was not detected, i.e., the whole stomach is alkalinized, in 1 (7%) patient; and (4) PPGAP was noted in 3 (20%) patients with extensions of 2, 2, and 5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PPGAP is present in a minority of patients after Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding may explain part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> control and that the gastric fundus may play a role in the genesis of the PPGAP </plain></SENT>
