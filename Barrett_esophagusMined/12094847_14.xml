<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Several previous studies have shown that malignant progression in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM) occurs even in patients treated with fundoplication or acid suppression therapy (AST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that AST may not alter malignant progression in BM if key genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle control, particularly p53, are defective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Initial and follow-up biopsies from 21 patients with BM treated with AST and observed for 1-13 yr were entered in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsies were graded for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and evaluated for p53 protein accumulation and oxidative DNA damage by immunohiostochemistry, using antibodies to p53 and to 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA ploidy was determined using image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, log rank test, and multivariate regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with p53 positive initial biopsies were more likely to have progression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> grade (p = 0.022) and DNA ploidy status (p = 0.023) than those with p53 negative biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In eight patients AST resulted in significant reduction in oxidative DNA damage in the five patients with p53-negative initial biopsies, but not the three with p53 positive ones (p = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that failure of AST to alter malignant progression in BM may be due, at least in part, to defects in DNA repair and cell cycle control resulting from p53 gene mutation, present before AST treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although AST may be effective in preventing further DNA damage, it is unlikely to alter progression in genetically unstable cells </plain></SENT>
