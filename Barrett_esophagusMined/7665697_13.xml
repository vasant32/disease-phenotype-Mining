<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the expression of HLA-ABC and HLA-DR major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (ICAM)-1 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, inflamed, metaplastic, and neoplastic oesophageal tissue and in freshly disaggregated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sequential sections of frozen tissue and cytospins of freshly disaggregated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> were stained using the ABC peroxidase system and monoclonal antibodies specific for HLA-ABC, HLA-DR and ICAM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> oesophageal tissue showed positive staining for HLA-ABC in the basal layers of the oesophageal squamous epithelium and on the epithelial cells of the submucosal oesophageal glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR and ICAM-1 were not detected in either of these cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 20 of 37 (54%) <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> HLA-ABC was expressed weakly, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> expression in nine (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> showed strong expression of HLA-ABC, but 15 of 37 (41%) were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR and ICAM-1 were expressed weakly in six of 37 (16%) <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> without correlation with each other or with the expression of HLA-ABC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HLA-ABC is absent from a high proportion of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (41%) and is otherwise variably and weakly expressed with strong expression in only a small fraction (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In other <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> there is a higher level of HLA-ABC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy may partly explain the aggressive nature of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR and ICAM-1 are not normally expressed on those cells from which oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> are thought to arise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The limited expression found here could suggest a partial or inhibited immune response against oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In vivo repressive factors may be involved </plain></SENT>
