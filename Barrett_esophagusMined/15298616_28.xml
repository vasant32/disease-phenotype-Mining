<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of NERD differs according to the population and geographical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oesophageal hypersensitivity in NERD has not been well studied, especially in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate oesophageal hypersensitivity in Japanese NERD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed upper GI endoscopy and the modified acid perfusion test on 14 control subjects and 68 GERD patients, including 26 with NERD, 34 with erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, and six with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stimulus-response function to acid was quantified by three parameters (lag time, intensity rating and the acid perfusion sensory score) and compared among four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean value of the lag time, intensity rating, and acid perfusion scores in NERD patients (4.6 +/- 3.4, 4.4 +/- 3.4, 27.8 +/- 26.7, respectively) were higher than in erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (3.2 +/- 3.3, 3.0 +/- 3.2, 18.2 +/- 24.8) and Barrett patients (2.5 +/- 4.0, 1.8 +/- 3.3, 15.0 +/- 28.8), and significantly higher than in the control group (1.7 +/- 2.7, 1.1 +/- 2.0, 5.4 +/- 11.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of patients with higher sensory scores was also greater in the NERD group (57.7%) than in erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (32.3%) and Barrett group (16.7%), and significantly greater than in control group (6.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that oesophageal sensitivity is likely to be enhanced especially in NERD patients also in Japanese population in comparison with erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
