<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no data on the expression or prognostic value of beta 1 integrins in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: We assessed the expression pattern and the prognostic impact of beta 1 integrins in paraffin-embedded specimens of 41 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> by immunochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of investigation, neither histomorphological parameters nor the survival time were known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no correlation between histomorphological parameters and the expression of beta 1 integrins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of beta 1 integrins had no influence on long- term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a relationship between the prognosis and the following histopathological parameters: pT, pN and pM category, the UICC stage, the presence of lymphangiosis, and the DNA content of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results obtained in this study did not show that the expression of beta 1 integrins was of prognostic value in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies in a larger number of patients are required to confirm the results obtained in this investigation </plain></SENT>
