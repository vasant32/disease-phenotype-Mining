<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively screened 125 actively drinking alcoholic patients undergoing upper endoscopy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gastric subepithelial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were found in 20 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens of hemorrhagic lesions and nonhemorrhagic mucosa 1 and 3 cm away were taken with a "jumbo" forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gastric biopsy specimens from 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> served as controls for biopsy-induced trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy slides from the patients and controls were coded before histologic scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> scores (range, 0-4) for the target lesions (2.9 +/- 0.3) were significantly greater than scores for the adjacent mucosa (1 cm, 1.0 +/- 0.2; 3 cm, 1.1 +/- 0.2) or control biopsy specimens (0.8 +/- 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> was superficial, occurring primarily in the foveolar region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mucosal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (score range, 0-4) was a prominent feature in the adjacent, nonhemorrhagic mucosa (target lesion, 0.7 +/- 0.2; 1 cm, 1.9 +/- 0.4; 3 cm, 2.0 +/- 0.3; controls, 0.8 +/- 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> extended into the deeper gland zones in 11 of 20 patients but in none of the 12 controls (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory cell infiltrates were mild and scores did not vary significantly among the three biopsy sites in alcoholic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that subepithelial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> seen at endoscopy in alcoholic patients represent localized <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> of the foveolar region with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the surrounding mucosa but without prominent inflammatory cell infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rather than use the term "hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>," endoscopists should simply describe these lesions as subepithelial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
