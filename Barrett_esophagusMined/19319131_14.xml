<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to measure the relative risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) associated with demographic factors, measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, and smoking among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients newly diagnosed with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) (n=197) were compared with patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (n=418) in a community clinic-based case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case subgroups included those with any visible columnar epithelium (VBE) (n=97), and those with a long segment (&gt;or=2 cm) of columnar epithelium (LSBE) (n=54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Risks increased with older age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) per decade for SIM=1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-1.5; VBE aOR=1.4, CI=1.1-1.6; LSBE aOR=1.5, CI=1.2-1.9), male gender (SIM aOR=1.5, CI=1.1-2.2; VBE aOR=2.7, CI=1.6-4.5; LSBE aOR=3.9, CI=1.9-8.1), and possibly Asian race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased risk of BE was observed with high waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, male high: &gt;or=0.9, female high: &gt;or=0.8) (SIM aOR=1.3, CI=0.9-2.1; VBE aOR=1.9, CI=1.0-3.5; LSBE aOR=4.1, CI=1.5-11.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These associations were independent of body mass index (BMI) for the VBE and LSBE case groups but not for SIM, which was the only case group in which BMI was a significant risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ever having smoked cigarettes increased risk similarly for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> case groups (SIM aOR=1.8, CI=1.2-2.6; VBE aOR=1.6, CI=1.0-2.6; LSBE aOR=2.6, CI=1.3-4.9), although a dose-response relationship was not detected for duration or intensity of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Older age, male gender, and history of smoking increased risk of SIM and BE among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients independent of other risk factors for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> was most strongly related to risk of VBE and LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results may be useful in the development of risk profiles for screening <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
