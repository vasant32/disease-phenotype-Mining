<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is uncertain whether molecular or proliferative alterations are present in the early stages of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred thirty-eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> symptoms were subjected to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies of the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p53 protein expression and the Ki-67 proliferation index were determined by immunohistochemical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 4 groups according to histopathologic diagnosis: G1, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium (n=58); G2, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n=42); G3, moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n=23), and G4, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p53 overexpression was detected in 7% of G1, 21.4% of G2, 52.2% of G3, and 60% of G4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences between G1 and G3 or G4 (P&lt;0.001) and between G2 and G4 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Ki-67 index was 21.3+/-19.5% in G1, 30.8+/-23.4% in G2, 47.1+/-23.2% in G3, and 48.3+/-25.7% in G4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in the Ki-67 index were found between groups: G1 x G3 (P&lt;0.001), G1 x G4 (P&lt;0.001), G2 x G3 (P=0.026), and G2 x G4 (P=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>p53 and Ki-67 overexpression were correlated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: p53 overexpression and the Ki-67 (MIB-1) index were correlated with histologic findings of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the esophageal mucosa, particularly in the moderate and severe forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
