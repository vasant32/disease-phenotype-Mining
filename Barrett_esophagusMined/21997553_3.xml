<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to estimate the incidence of OAC in patients with BO without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1966 to 2011 and performed a bibliographic review of previous publications, excluding abstracts, non-peer-reviewed publications and those not published in English, for prospective or retrospective studies of the incidence of OAC in patients with BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They excluded patients with any degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at baseline and those without documented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies were independently reviewed by two individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>57 of 3450 studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors extracted information on number of patients with BO, length of follow-up, incident cases of OAC, mean age of patients, country of origin, whether prospective or retrospective, mean length of BO segments and mortality from causes other than OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Study quality was assessed by the Ottawa Newcastle criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 57 included studies comprised 11,434 patients and 58,547 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pooled annual incidence of OAC was 0.33% (95% CI 0.28% to 0.38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among 16 studies that provided appropriate information on mortality, there were 56 incident cases of OAC but 684 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from apparently unrelated causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among 16 studies that provided information on patients with short-segment BO, the annual incidence of OAC was only 0.19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of OAC in non-dysplastic BO is around 1 per 300 patients per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of OAC in short-segment BO is under 1 per 500 patients per year </plain></SENT>
