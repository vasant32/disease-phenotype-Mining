<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 2006 and February 2007, consecutive individuals aged between 18 and 75 years, who underwent routine upper endoscopy as part of their regular medical examination were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic and medical information were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was defined endoscopically as visible breaks of the distal esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was diagnosed endoscopically and confirmed histologically. "Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>" was defined when erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were present in an individual without reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 2580 individuals included, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were found in 4.3 % (n = 110) and 1.0 % (n = 27), respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the prevalence of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in individuals without GERS was 1.6 % and 0.5 %, respectively, giving an overall prevalence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> of 2.0 % (46 / 2270) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified that male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 2.87, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.24 - 6.66; P = 0.014), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> (OR = 9.68, 95 %CI 5.00 - 17.95; P &lt; 0.001), and alcohol consumption (OR = 3.17, 95 %CI 1.44 - 6.97; P = 0.004) were positively associated with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter Pylori infection</z:hpo> (OR = 0.37, 95 %CI 0.14 - 0.98; P = 0.046) was negatively associated with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alcohol consumption (OR = 5.32, 95 %CI 1.55 - 13.33; P = 0.008) was positively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in asymptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this cohort of the adult Chinese population without reflux symptoms, the prevalence of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is 1.6 % and 0.5 %, respectively, with an overall prevalence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> of 2.0 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Male sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>, and alcohol consumption are positively associated with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, whereas a negative association exists for H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
