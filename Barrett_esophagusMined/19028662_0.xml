<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trying to identify various factors being responsible for the above differences, 637 patient's data, who underwent previous oesophago-gastric surgery between 1985-2005, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biochemical, histological and electrophysiological examinations had been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>-like metabolic changes and enteric ganglionitis as morphological alternations of LES muscles induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> may be reasons for complaints after antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The marking of Z-line with endoscopic clips followed by an immediately upright contrast study and substractional evaluation is appropriate for detecting true short esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Open surgical procedures are justified even in the new millennium in cases when the patient already underwent previous upper abdominal operations - due to an increased risk of injury because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> - in cases of primarily recurrent paraesophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> after an unsuccessful open and/or laparoscopic reconstruction, as well as in cases of reflux with complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the gastro-oesophageal junction are examined preoperatively, the ratio of the performed catabolic - AMAN, CB, and DPP I - enzymatic activity of the tissue sample from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and adjacent intact mucosa within 2 cm of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> may have a prognostic value even in the preoperative examination period, and neo-adjuvant treatment should be considered in these group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients' post-operative complaints and symptoms change during the post-operative period and correlate with the parameters of the myoelectric and contractile activities of the "Akiyama stomach" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tachygastria seems to be the major pathogenetic factor involved in the contractile dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gastro-jejuno-duodenal interposition represents an adequate 'second-best' method of choice if technical difficulties emerge with jejunal or colon interposition following limited resection of the oesophagus performed due to early Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> or non-dilatable peptic stricture </plain></SENT>
