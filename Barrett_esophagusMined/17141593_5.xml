<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The natural history of Barrett's Oeosphagus is not completely clarified and Barrett's Oeosphagus Registries are considered useful tools to expand our knowledge on this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Barrett's Oeosphagus Registry has been therefore established in the Veneto Region and neighbouring provinces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aims of the Registry are to assess the demographical, endoscopical and histological characteristics of Barrett's Oeosphagus patients; the prevalence of non-invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and the timing and incidence of Barrett's Oeosphagus progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An interdisciplinary committee of endoscopists, pathologists and information technology experts was established in 2004 to design a website-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> Registry for the Veneto Region and neighbouring north-eastern Italian provinces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protocols for endoscopies and biopsies and standard reports were carefully defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first 18 months, 397 patients with endoscopically visible and histologically proven Barrett's Oeosphagus were enrolled in the Registry; the median age of these patients was 66 years (male:female=3:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients (75%) had a Short Segment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> (&lt;or=3 cm) and only 1 in 4 had a Long Segment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> (&gt;3 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long Segment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> patients were 5 years older than the Short Segment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> patients (p&lt;0.05), suggesting a progression from Short Segment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> to Long Segment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Though no data are available on the incidence of non-invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (i.e., progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at least 12 months after enrolment), the prevalence of neoplastic lesions (found within 12 months of enrolment) was 5% for Short Segment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> and 19% for Long Segment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e>, indicating that a careful multiple-biopsy endoscopic protocol is needed, especially when Long Segment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> are suspected at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> among patients with non-invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was 1/17 cases of low-grade non-invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and 2/3 cases of high-grade non-invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, indicating that these patients require strict endoscopic and bioptic follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A regional Barrett's Oeosphagus Registry is feasible at a relatively low cost and enables significant data to be collected in a relatively short time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of a standardised endoscopic nomenclature and report form, a strict biopsy protocol, a standard report for pathologists improves the quality of endoscopic and histological diagnoses </plain></SENT>
