<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed that the incidence of EA in men has increased tenfold from the 1970s and was 1.10/100,000/year in 1998-2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In women, a 4.5-fold increase was observed (incidence 0.11/100,000/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1998-2002, the mean annual number of new EA cases was 57.4 (79.8% men) in Finland with a population of 5.2 million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our hospital referral area with a mean population of 261 349, 11 EAs were observed in 1996-2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of them, two (18.2%) had BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One EA was detected during surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EA comprised 0.05% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in our hospital referral area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that EA incidence has increased significantly in men in Finland, but still EA is seldom detected on BE surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EA is an uncommon cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in our hospital referral area </plain></SENT>
