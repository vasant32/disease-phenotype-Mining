<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To analyze the problems that occur with attempts at quantitation, 55 patients were prospectively evaluated (45 patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and ten patients with clinical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e>, four of whom had Bilroth II surgery) with Tc-99m DISIDA, using a fasting technique with gallbladder stimulation by sincalide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> occurred in 16 of 55 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overlap of small bowel with the stomach is the major problem for accurate quantitation and occurred in 20 of 55 patients (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overlap of left lobe of the liver occurred in 40 of 55 patients (73%), but its contribution to gastric activity was slight and could be easily subtracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reflux was intermittent in six of the 16 positive studies (38%), and continuous computer acquisition is needed to detect its maximum value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primarily because of the problem of small bowel overlap, scintigraphic evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> is only, at best, semi-quantitative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A review of the technical variables used in this examination, as well as potential problems that can occur, is provided </plain></SENT>
