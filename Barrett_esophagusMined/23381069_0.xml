<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The need to combat the rising incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with its dismal prognosis has led to increasing development of many endoscopic treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been shown to be a safe and effective endoscopic treatment modality for dysplastic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The durability of successful eradication of dysplastic BE has been reported by earlier studies with limited sample size, follow-up time, and inadequate cohort of patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this issue, Orman and colleagues present their findings from their single center, retrospective cohort of patients who underwent RFA with post-treatment surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They report a low recurrence rate of 5.2% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no clinical characteristics found to be associated with BE recurrence in terms of length of segment or degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (CE-D) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was determined after a single post-RFA endoscopic examination with biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is an area of controversy as previous studies have used a minimum of two negative examinations before CE can be claimed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There are also limitations from sampling error during surveillance biopsies and the loss of a third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> post-RFA patients during surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multicenter, prospective studies with adequate follow-up are still needed before we can draw recommendations when to adequately cease post-treatment surveillance and to identify patients with increased risk of either recurrence or progression </plain></SENT>
