<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that BE or parts of its phenotype are genetically predisposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been validated as predisposing to BE but the inherent flaws in the trial sizes, presence of controls and statistical power need circumspect analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current paper links the interleukin 18 cytokine with BE and perhaps EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Setting aside the issues above there are other issues such as the functional relevance of these SNPs for the association BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There have been several case control series published indicating other genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there are some sibling pairs study results with another set of genes identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Invariably as useful as these studies are the size, scale to answer complex questions (complexity) and potential clinical significance are proportional in genomic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The new era of large-scale genome-wide studies in Barrett's and EA is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Shortly the first will be published showing two SNPs of significance in 7,838 Barrett's patients </plain></SENT>
