<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Children with cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (CF) have a marked predilection to develop GE reflux, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is one complication of GE reflux not previously described in CF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe in detail two adolescents with CF who were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and mention three other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in CF patients may be missed because GE reflux is often relatively silent in CF, because patients may consider mild upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms as "part of CF," and because of the nature of Barrett's epithelium itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy with documentation of landmarks and multiple targeted biopsies should be performed in children with CF with even mild symptoms of GE reflux or an abnormal 24 h intra-esophageal pH study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any biopsies containing columnar epithelium should be stained with Alcian blue at pH 2.5 to look for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath>, i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with CF may be a high-risk group for development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and its complications, especially given the increased survival in CF </plain></SENT>
