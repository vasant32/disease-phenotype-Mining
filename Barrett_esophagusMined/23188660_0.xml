<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess the accuracy of predicting high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (IMC) in mucosa predicted as being nondysplastic vs. dysplastic by high definition white light endoscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE), narrow band imaging (NBI), and confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in a tertiary referral setting between February 2010 and September 2011. A total of 50 consecutive patients who were referred to St Vincent's Hospital for management of dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A prediction of likely histology was made for each mucosal point (four-quadrant every 1 cm and any visible mucosal abnormality), first with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE, followed by NBI, and finally CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were taken at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1190 individual biopsy points were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At histology, 39 biopsy points were found to harbor HGD and 52 biopsy points harbored IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the detection of HGD/IMC the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> - WLE, 79.1 %, 83.1 %, and 82.8 %; NBI, 89.0 %, 80.1 %, and 81.4 %; and CLE, 75.7 %, 80.0 %, and 79.9 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mucosal points with IMC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with HGD were detected by targeted biopsies guided by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE and NBI without the need for random Seattle protocol biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE in combination with NBI is highly accurate in the detection of HGD/IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Performing targeted biopsies in the surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is possible in expert centers </plain></SENT>
