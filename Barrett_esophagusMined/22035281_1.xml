<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A standardized histopathological analysis was focused not only on SIM but also on the presence of metaplastic processes typical of additional glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A morphological study using standardized histopathological tests was carried out between 2004 and 2007, with biopsies taken from esophageal mucosa of 826 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age and male : female ratio of patients were 55.6 Â± 14.7 and 1.1 : 1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 4.1% (n = 34) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases proved to have SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remainder of the cases (n = 615; 74.4%) contained cardiac-fundic mucosa without SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some samples exhibited superficial mucous glands, pancreatic acinar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>), and ciliated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> accounting for 24% (n = 198), 14.9% (n = 123), and 0.2% (n = 2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SIM was colocalized with superficial mucous glands (103/198 superficial mucous gland cases; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 51; 6.2%) and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 9; 1.1%) were found mainly in SIM (37/51; 9/9; P = 0.071) with male preponderance (3 : 1 at low-grade and 2 : 1 at high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SIM alone in the esophagus is rare, and its frequent association with cardiac mucosa-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> testifies to transition of mucinous-goblet cell through pseudogoblet cells </plain></SENT>
