<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the impact of endoscopic biopsy surveillance on the outcome of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From November 1992 to December 2000, 328 patients with histologically proven oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were referred to our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred of these patients had Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 12 (12%) patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was discovered during endoscopic surveillance for Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of gastro-oesophatgeal reflux disease in the Barrett's group was 38.8% versus 8.1% (P &lt; 0.01) of non-Barrett's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the surveyed group, there were 9 (75%) early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (Tis-1N0), versus 10 (11.4%, P &lt; 0.01) in the non-surveyed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three out of five surveyed patients operated on for high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> proved to have invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the oesophagectomy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surveyed patients were alive after a median follow-up period of 50 months; the median survival in the non-surveyed group was 24 +/- 3 months (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> allows early detection of malignant degeneration and better long-term survival than in non-surveyed patients </plain></SENT>
