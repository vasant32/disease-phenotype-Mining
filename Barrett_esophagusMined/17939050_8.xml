<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Demographic and lifestyle factors, endoscopy and histology reports were extracted from 1,761 subjects from seven UK centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The associations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined oesophagus</z:e> with demographic and lifestyle factors and the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 5.5% of patients had prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (more common in males, older patients, patients diagnosed earlier in the cohort and current or recent smokers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> incidence was 23 patients in 3,912 years or 0.59% per annum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only increased age at diagnosis correlated with an increased risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or alcohol history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> occurs more commonly in older patients and is more frequent in males than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Once <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined oesophagus</z:e> had been diagnosed, there were no other demographic or lifestyle factors which were predictive of the development of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in this cohort </plain></SENT>
