<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been stated that ablation, combined with acid suppression or antireflux surgery, may reduce the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, thereby obviating the need for endoscopic surveillance in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen symptomatic patients were enrolled in a prospective study of Nd:YAG laser ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> followed by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> or antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and no associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laser treatment was performed with noncontact fibers and a power output of 60 watts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean number of treatment sessions was three (range 1 to 5), and the mean energy delivered during each session was 2800 joules (range 600 to 4800 joules) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were given a standard dose of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (40 mg/day) throughout the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two patients a mild distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> occurred and required a single <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic and histologic eradication of the specialized columnar epithelium was documented in 8 of 12 patients with tongues of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, in one of four patients with circumferential Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, and in two of two patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In five patients (28%) only a partial ablation could be achieved despite repeated laser treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (11%), one with tongues and the other with circumferential Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, were considered nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> undermining regenerated squamous epithelium was found, 6 months after eradication, in one patient who underwent esophagogastric resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients agreed to undergo antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up period of 14 months (range 4 to 32 months), two patients presented with recurrent Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>: one at 8 months after successful Nissen fundoplication and the other after 1 year of continuous <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Progression of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was found in two other patients receiving pharmacologic therapy in whom a partial response to laser treatment had been obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Nd:YAG laser therapy of nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, performed in conjunction with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> treatment and followed by antireflux surgery, allows a partial regression of specialized columnar epithelium in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, this is a time-consuming procedure that produced only temporary eradication, did not prove effective in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk, and did not obviate the need for endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
