<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to characterize TP53 mutations and p53 protein immunoreactivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1514390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preinvasive lesions</z:e> of Barrett's esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were examined by polymerase chain reaction amplification, denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis, and sequencing for the presence of TP53 mutations in exons 5-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 9 cases, Barrett's epithelium adjacent to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p53 protein immunoreactivity was studied with PAb 1801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen mutations were found in 15 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, including 10 missense, 3 nonsense, 1 frameshift, and 2 mutations located within consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nucleotide substitutions were transitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 12 transitions involving a GC base pair occurred within the context of a CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p53 immunostaining was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 cases with missense mutations and in 1 case without a detectable mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The surrounding Barrett's mucosa showed TP53 mutations identical to that observed in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in only 3 of 5 specimens showing high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TP53 gene mutations and p53 protein immunostaining are present in a majority of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that these mutations are involved at an early stage during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
