<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these patients, during the open era of surgery, we performed acid suppression + duodenal diversion procedures added to the antireflux procedure (fundoplication + vagotomy + antrectomy + Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy) to obtain better results at long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study is to present the results of 3 to 5 years' follow-up in patients with short-segment and long-segment or complicated BE (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> or stricture) who underwent fundoplication or the acid suppression-duodenal diversion technique, both performed by a laparoscopic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred eight patients with histologically confirmed BE were included: 58 patients with short-segment BE, and 50 with long-segment BE, 28 of whom had complications associated with severe erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, or stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After surgery, among patients treated with fundoplication with cardia calibration, endoscopic erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was observed in 6.9% of patients with short-segment BE, while 50% of patients with long-segment BE presented with positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, persistence of endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and progression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (in 5% of cases; P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, after acid suppression-duodenal diversion surgery in patients with long-segment BE, more than 95.6% presented with successful results regarding recurrent symptoms and endoscopic regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> to the cardiac mucosa was observed in 56.9% of patients with short-segment BE who underwent fundoplication and in 61% of those with long-segment BE treated with the acid suppression-duodenal diversion procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with long-segment BE who experienced fundoplication alone presented no regression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>; on the contrary, progression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was observed in 1 case (P = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with short-segment BE can be successfully treated with fundoplication, but for patients with long-segment BE, we suggest performance of fundoplication plus an acid suppression-duodenal diversion procedure </plain></SENT>
