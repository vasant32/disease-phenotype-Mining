<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a metaplastic condition in which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal epithelium is replaced by columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that one of the possible mechanisms is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> of squamous epithelium into columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology through which this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> occurs is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A recent study by serial analysis of gene expression showed that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4) is uniquely expressed in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, the role of the BMP pathway in the metaplastic transformation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous cells into columnar cells was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissues from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and BE and in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>-BE rat model were examined for the activation of the BMP pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Short-term cultures of primary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal cells were treated with BMP-4, and cell biological changes were examined by Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both human and rat tissues, the BMP pathway proved to be activated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upon incubation of squamous cell cultures with BMP-4, the cytokeratin expression pattern showed a shift that was consistent with columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the BMP pathway was suggested by up-regulation of Phosphorylated-Smad 1/5/8 (P-Smad 1/5/8) that was effectively blocked by Noggin, a BMP <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the gene expression profiles of squamous cells, BMP-4-treated squamous cells, and BE cells showed a significant shift in the profile of the BMP-4-treated squamous cells toward that of the cultured BE cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the BMP pathway could play a role in the transformation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous cells into columnar cells </plain></SENT>
