<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an effective means of eradicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), both with and without associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have documented high initial success rates with RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is limited data on IM detection rates after eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the rate of detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) after successful eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BE patients with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> who had undergone RFA were retrospectively identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only those who had complete eradication as documented on the initial post-ablation endoscopy, and had minimum two surveillance endoscopies, were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical, demographic, and endoscopic data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of IM detection was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-seven patients underwent RFA and had complete eradication of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients were male (76.6%), and the mean age was 64.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of newly detected IM at 1 year was 25.9% (95% CI 15.1-42.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was detected at the time of recurrence in four patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were detected at the GE junction in the absence of visible BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with recurrent IM had longer baseline segments of BE (median, 4 cm vs. 2 cm, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate of detection of new IM is high in patients who have undergone successful eradication of BE by RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> can recur at the GE junction in the absence of visible BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Future studies are warranted to identify those patients at increased risk for the development of recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
