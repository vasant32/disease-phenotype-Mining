<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients (8.6%) had presented with a primary oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three different epithelial types, junctional, atrophic fundic and intestinal were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty two (38%) patients had just one type of epithelium present, the other 36 (62%) having a combination of two or three different types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intestinal type of epithelium, either alone or in combination with gastric type epithelium was present in 48 (83%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In every case this intestinal type epithelium took the form of an incompletely differentiated variant of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, although complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> as a focal change was also present in 14 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histochemically, sulphomucins were present in the biopsies of 43 (74%) of the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were seen in both goblet and columnar mucous cells with almost equal frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incomplete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with sulphomucin production was present in four of the five patients with an oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e> sulphomucin production is common and its presence does not help to identify those individuals at particular risk of developing an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
