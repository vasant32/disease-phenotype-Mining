<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> commonly arises from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous condition</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, in which the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium is replaced by a columnar cell-lined epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic alterations occurring in this process could serve as biomarkers for the risk of malignant progression, improve surveillance, and contribute to early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined two potential biomarkers, cyclin D1 and p53, in a prospective cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 307 patients were enrolled in an endoscopic surveillance cohort, and esophageal biopsy specimens were collected at each endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were matched to control patients within the cohort by duration of follow-up, age, sex, and length of columnar cell-lined epithelium at recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were analyzed for cyclin D1 and p53 protein levels by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 12 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> occurred within the follow-up period, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy specimens from 11 cases stained positive for cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens from eight of these patients taken at recruitment also stained positive for cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A case-control analysis of biopsy specimens obtained at recruitment revealed a statistically significantly increased risk of progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients whose biopsy specimens were cyclin D1 positive (odds ratio [OR] = 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>85; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.57-29.91; P =.0106) but not in patients whose biopsy specimens were p53 positive (OR = 2.99; 95% CI = 0.57-15.76; P =.197) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cyclin D1-positive staining could be a useful biomarker in identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients at high risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Given the complexity of genetic alterations in the natural history of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, additional biomarkers will be required to increase the sensitivity and specificity of molecular diagnosis </plain></SENT>
