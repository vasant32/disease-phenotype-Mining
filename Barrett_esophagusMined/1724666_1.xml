<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Operability was 90% (232/257), overall resectability 77% (198/257) and for the operated group 85% (198/232) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 9.6% but decreased to 3% over the period 1986-1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 65% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous cell epitheliomas</z:e> and 35% <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>pTNM staging was as follows: Stage I: 11.6%; Stage II: 23.2%; Stage III: 37.9%; Stage IV: 27.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 62.5% at 1 year, 42.4% at 2 year and 30% at 5 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the pTNM staging 5-year survival was 90% for Stage I, 56% for Stage II, 15.3% for Stage III and 0 for Stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localisation, pathologic type, sex, age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Introducing extensive resection and extended lymphadenectomy seems to improve significantly survival in the patients in whom an operation with curative intention was performed, the 1-year survival being 90.8% versus 72%, 2-year survival: 81% versus 46%, and 5-year survival 48.5% versus 41% for respectively radical and non radical resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> have no worse prognosis than other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> with a 5-year survival of 91.5% if lymphnodes negative, and a 54% overall 5-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional results after restoration of continuity with gastric tubulation were judged excellent to very good in 86.5% at 1 year, but infra-aortic anastomoses have a much higher incidence of peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>: 53% versus 8% for cervical anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From this study it can be concluded that in experienced hands surgery today offers the best chances for optimal staging, potential cure, and prolonged high quality palliation </plain></SENT>
