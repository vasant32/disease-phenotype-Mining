<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted between June 2007 and November 2008 in the Erzurum Training and Research Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed SCE and MN frequencies in 30 patients with BE, and in 30 control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SCE was significantly increased in BE patients compared with controls (6.89 +/- 1.04 vs. 5.01+/- 0.88, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, MN was significantly increased in BE patients compared with controls (3.48 +/- 1.08 vs. 1.83 +/- 0.64, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the increased SCE and MN rates in lymphocytes of patients with BE may reflect genomic instability or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268134" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deficiency of DNA repair</z:e> capacity </plain></SENT>
