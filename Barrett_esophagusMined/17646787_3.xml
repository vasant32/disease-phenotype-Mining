<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> within long and short segments of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> and to analyze the distribution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> within long segments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was performed on the initial endoscopy carried out among 112 patients enrolled in an endoscopic surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two patients with columnar mucosa extending more than 3 cm into the esophagus (group I) and 40 patients with a short segment of columnar mucosa (group II) had multiple biopsies according to a standardized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1163 biopsies were analyzed on the whole: 949 biopsies in group I and 214 biopsies in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was identified among 650 (68.5%) and 50 (23.4%) biopsies in groups I and II respectively (P&lt;10-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of biopsies with foci of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> increased significantly with the length of the columnar mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was confirmed in 100% of the patients in group I and in 45% of the patients in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In long segments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was more frequently observed in the 2 upper thirds of the columnar mucosa that in the lower third (P&lt;10-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Detailed mapping of the distribution of epithelial types within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> identified three patterns of distribution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> within long segments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>: unifocal, multifocal and diffuse, in 5%, 56% and 39% of the patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was present in 15% of patients with long segments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and 11% of patients with short segments (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The distribution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and three distinct patterns can be identified: unifocal, multifocal and diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Considering the risk of sampling error, the current recommendations concerning the biopsy protocols are mandatory until the validation of new techniques such as chromoendoscopy or magnifying endoscopy </plain></SENT>
