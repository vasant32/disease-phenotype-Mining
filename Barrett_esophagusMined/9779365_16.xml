<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two biopsies at the antrum, four distal to the squamous-columnar junction and two proximal in the esophageal mucosa, were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> were divided into four groups, according to the severity of endoscopic findings: patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, patients with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, patients with short-segment and long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control subjects had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> histological findings at the cardia in 90% of cases, fundic mucosa being present twice as cardial epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>Carditis</z:mp> was present in 8% of cases and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) in 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, patients with GER had <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp> in nearly 50% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was present in 12% of cases with GER without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, in 35% of cases with short-segment BE and in 65% of the cases with long-segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IM at the antrum was present in only 5% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Helicobacter pylori at the squamous-columnar junction was present in 13% of control subjects and in 30% of the patients with GER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp> is an easy and objective marker for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and the presence of Helicobacter pylori at this region must be carefully evaluated in order to determine some pathogenic role for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
