<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Classification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE has significant interobserver variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine whether genetic alterations in BE correlate with degrees of histologic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fixed tissue from 37 patients with BE and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was studied for six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissues were microdissected and analyzed for loss of heterozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microdissection of individual crypts showing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were performed and analyzed for 23 of the 37 patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were heterozygous for at least four of the six genes studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frequency of alterations for MXI1, hOGG1, p53, MTS1, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>, and APC were 7 of 32 (22%), 12 of 35 (34%), 12 of 26 (46%), 17 of 30 (57%), 17 of 27 (63%), and 23 of 36 (64%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of BE demonstrated that crypts with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> strongly correlated with alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that genetic analysis can be performed on individual crypts in patients with BE, and that alterations may facilitate objective classification of the severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
