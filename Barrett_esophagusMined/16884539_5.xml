<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), particularly high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), is an area of much debate and controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical esophagectomy, intensive endoscopic surveillance and mucosal ablative techniques, especially photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>), have been proposed as possible management strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the health related quality of life associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and many of the pivotal health states associated with Barrett's HGD management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were enrolled in a pilot survey study at a large urban hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The utility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (current health state) as well as various health states associated with HGD management (hypothetical states as the subject did not have HGD) were measured using a validated health utility instrument (Paper Standard Gamble) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These specific health states were chosen for the study because they are considered pivotal in Barrett's HGD decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Information regarding Barrett's HGD was presented to the subject in a standardized format that was designed to be easily comprehendible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average utility scores (0-1 with 0 = <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and 1 = perfect health) for the various <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> associated states were: BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-0.95; Post-esophagectomy for HGD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>-0.92; Post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> for HGD with recurrence uncertainty-0.93; Post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> for HGD with recurrence uncertainty and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>-0.91; Intensive endoscopic surveillance for HGD-0.90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We present the scores for utilities associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> as well as various states associated with the management of HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of our study may be useful in advising patients and providers regarding expected outcomes of the various HGD management strategies as well as providing utility scores for future cost-effectiveness analyses </plain></SENT>
