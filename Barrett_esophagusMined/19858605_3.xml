<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Narrow band imaging (NBI), one of the most recent techniques, consists of using interference filters for the illumination of the target in narrowed red, green, and blue (R/G/B) bands of the spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This results in different images at distinct levels in the mucosa and increases the contrast of the epithelial surface and of the subjacent vascular network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NBI is combined to magnifying endoscopy with an optical zoom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After being studied in prototypes the opto-electronic technique, now available in the most recent models of video-endoscopes that use the sequential R/G/B system of illumination, should be adapted in the near future for the instruments utilizing the non-sequential system of illumination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This new technique aims to characterize the surface of the distinct types of digestive epithelia, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technique also allows characterizing the disorganization of the vascular pattern in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> of the digestive mucosa and in superficial neoplastic lesions in the esophagus, stomach, and large bowel </plain></SENT>
