<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous epithelium is replaced with a specialized metaplastic columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BE is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> that can progress to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, there are no early molecular indicators that would predict progression from BE to EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the only permanent residents of the epithelium, stem cells have been implicated in this metaplastic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the expression of doublecortin and CaM kinase-like-1 (DCAMKL-1) and other putative gastrointestinal stem cell markers in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa (NEM), BE, and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human NEM, BE, EAC, and multitissue microarrays were analyzed for DCAMKL-1, and immunohistochemically scored based on staining intensity and tissue involvement, with epithelia and stroma scored separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolated from BE and paired NEM was subjected to real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis for DCAMKL-1, leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor (LGR5), and Musashi-1 (Msi-1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DCAMKL-1 was minimally expressed in squamous NEM, but increased in BE (with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) and EAC tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In EAC, we found increased stromal DCAMKL-1 staining compared to adjacent epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the submucosa of dysplastic BE tissues, an increase in the endothelial cell expression of DCAMKL-1 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, an upregulation of DCAMKL-1, LGR5, and Msi-1 mRNA was seen in BE compared to squamous NEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we report the progressive increase of DCAMKL-1 expression in BE from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was an increase in putative stem cell markers DCAMKL-1, LGR5, and Msi-1 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that the regulation of resident stem cells might play an important role in the progression of BE to EAC </plain></SENT>
