<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytokeratin profile of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, complicating severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e>, was determined in 35 consecutive patients and in 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in order to provide insight into the origin of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining of frozen sections showed abundant immunoactivity for cytokeratin (CK) 13, which is characteristic of squamous epithelia, including that of the oesophagus, but is not present in the simple columnar epithelium of the cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the latter epithelium expresses mainly CK 8, 18 and 19, also found in Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of CK 13 in Barrett's epithelium may indicate its origin from the squamous oesophageal epithelium and not from the proximal migration of columnar epithelial cells of the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
