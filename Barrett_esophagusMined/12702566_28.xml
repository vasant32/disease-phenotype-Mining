<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi>-based photosensitizer Photofrin, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for this therapy, suffers from certain disadvantages: its complex chemical nature; retention by skin (leading to protracted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000992'>cutaneous photosensitivity</z:hpo>); and less than optimal photophysical properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examine the population pharmacokinetics and cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005653'>phototoxicity</z:mp> of 2-[1-hexyloxyethyl]-2-devinyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48398">pyropheophorbide-a</z:chebi> (HPPH), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36303">chlorin</z:chebi>-type photosensitizer with more favorable photophysical properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HPPH plasma concentration-time data were obtained in 25 patients enrolled in Phase I-II clinical trials for the treatment of partially obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the lung, or multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Doses of 3, 4, 5, or 6 mg/m(2) were administered as 1-h i.v. infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetic data for each patient were fitted with a standard two-compartment (biexponential) model with continuous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The model fitting approach was iteratively reweighted nonlinear regression, with weights equal to the reciprocal of the square of the predicted HPPH plasma concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The complete set of data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 25 patients was then fitted simultaneously with nonlinear mixed effects modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005653'>phototoxicity</z:mp> responses were determined, as a function of time after HPPH infusion, following exposure to various doses of light from a solar simulator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The estimates of the population mean (variance) for each parameter were as follows: volume of distribution (V(C)), 2.40 liters/m(2) (0.259); steady-state volume (V(SS)), 9.58 liters/m(2) (11.6); systemic clearance (CL), 0.0296 liter/h/m(2) (0.000094); and distributional clearance (CL(D)), 0.144 liter/h/m(2) (0.00166) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These parameters were independent of dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clearance increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A relative error model was used for the difference in the raw and fitted data, and the overall coefficient of variation estimate across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the data was 14.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The estimated mean population alpha and beta half-lives (95% confidence interval) were 7.77 h (3.46-17.6 h) and 596 h (120-2951 h), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of serum showed no circulating HPPH metabolites, and in vitro incubation of HPPH with human liver microsomal preparations resulted in no metabolite or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24298">glucuronic acid</z:chebi>-HPPH conjugate production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A minimal skin response to the solar simulator was observed, mostly in patients treated with the highest dose of HPPH, 6 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the HPPH pharmacokinetic parameters were consistent with a highly lipophilic agent that is concentrated in plasma and is nearly 100% bound to plasma proteins; this was verified by plasma protein binding studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Whereas low concentrations of HPPH can be detected in plasma several months after a single infusion, no instances of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000992'>cutaneous photosensitivity</z:hpo> have been noted in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In general, HPPH pharmacokinetic profiles are readily predictable from the global population model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This is the first comprehensive human population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of a clinical anticancer photodynamic therapy agent </plain></SENT>
