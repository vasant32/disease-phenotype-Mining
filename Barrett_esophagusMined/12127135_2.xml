<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), even after antireflux surgery, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> can progress to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or even <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the opposite-that is regression of dysplastic changes to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> after antireflux surgery-has been documented in only a few reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a duodenal diversion operation on low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients with either short-segment (n = 12) or long-segment (n = 25) BE underwent antireflux surgery plus either a duodenal switch procedure (13 patients) or a partial distal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal anastomosis (24 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them were subjected to complete clinical, endoscopic, histologic, manometric, and 24-hour pH testing, and 24-hour monitoring of the bile exposure in distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this series, and morbidity occurred in only one patient (2.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Manometric assessment after surgery showed a significant increase in sphincter pressure, abdominal length, and total length (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">Acid reflux</z:e> showed a significant decrease after surgery, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e> was completely abolished in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was longer than 24 months (mean 60 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three to four endoscopic procedures were performed after surgery in each patient, and several biopsy specimens were taken distal to the squamo-columnar junction during each endoscopic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (91%) with short-segment BE demonstrated histologic regression to either cardiac mucosa or nondysplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the 25 patients with long-segment BE, there was a 62.5% rate of histologic regression to nondysplastic epithelium when the length of BE measured between 31 and 99 mm and 33% histologic regression when the length of BE was 101 mm or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of progression to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic length of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> did not change late after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 65% of patients with BE, antireflux surgery, gastric acid reduction, and duodenal diversion produced histologic regression of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to nondysplastic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This effect was even more pronounced when the length of BE was shorter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It seems to be permanent, and no progression to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has occurred </plain></SENT>
