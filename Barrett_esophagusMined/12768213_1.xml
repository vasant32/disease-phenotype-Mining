<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aim: To describe the endoscopic findings in adult patients subjected to esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for the evaluation of heartburn, and establish a relationship between the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients and Methods: We reviewed the endoscopic reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients older than 16 years old who were evaluated for heartburn in our institution, between December 1998 and December 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The statistical analysis to establish the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal Hernia</z:hpo> (HH) and Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>Esophagitis</z:hpo> (EE) was performed calculating the Odds Ratio (OR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: A total of 1270 outpatient EGD were performed in the study period, of which 345 (27%) had persistent heartburn as the indication for the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 174 females (50.43%) and 171 males (49.57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 151 (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight (17%) patients had EE in the absence of a HH, 63 (18%) had HH in the absence of EE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three patients (27%) had both HH and EE, 20 (6%) of patients had histologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 91 (26%) had other nonrelated findings such as antral <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> and 36 (10%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 156 patients with HH, 93 (59.6%) had also EE, whereas EE was present only in 58 of 189 (30.6%) patients who did not have HH, obtaining an OR of 3.33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Most of our patients with heartburn didn't have erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our series, patients with heartburn and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> have a three-fold risk of having erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> compared with patients with heartburn and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
