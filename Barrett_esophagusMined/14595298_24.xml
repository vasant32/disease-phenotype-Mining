<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a scoring system to predict esophageal findings at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive sample of 1011 adult patients scheduled for upper endoscopy were asked to complete a validated symptom questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The endoscopy reports were abstracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual logistic regression models were developed to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (long and short segment) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267081" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Schatzki's ring</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was independently associated with heartburn frequency (p&lt;0.0001) but not severity or duration (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was associated with the duration of acid regurgitation (p&lt;0.005) but not with frequency or severity (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strictures were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> severity (p&lt;0.0001) and duration (p&lt;0.0001) but not frequency (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a sensitivity of 80%, the models had a specificity of 49% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 57% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and 68% for strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At a specificity of 80%, the sensitivities were 51% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 62% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and 71% for strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic findings were associated with distinct attributes of reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptoms are only modestly predictive of findings at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
