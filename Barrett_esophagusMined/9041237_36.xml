<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A multilayered epithelium within Barrett's epithelium has been noted recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the hypothesis that this multilayered epithelium may be a transitional stage between squamous and Barrett's epithelium, cytokeratin immunocytochemistry was used to examine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous, Barrett's, and multilayered epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen endoscopic biopsy specimens taken from the squamo-Barrett's junction of 8 patients with Barrett's epithelium and 3 biopsy specimens from the gastroesophageal junction of 3 patients without Barrett's epithelium were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to cytokeratins 4 and 13 were used as markers for squamous differentiation, and antibodies to cytokeratins 8 and 19 were used as markers for glandular differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coded samples were evaluated by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with Barrett's epithelium and control patients, staining with columnar markers was confined to either the Barrett's or the gastric columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Staining with squamous markers was confined to the adjacent squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, focal areas of multilayered epithelium amidst Barrett's epithelium stained with cytokeratin antibodies for both squamous and columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A focal multilayered epithelium within Barrett's epithelium that expresses concurrently both squamous and glandular cytokeratin markers is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a multipotential cell as the cell of origin of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
