<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This autopsy study disproves this belief </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Even when the entire circumference of the gastroesophageal junction is examined, pure cardiac mucosa was completely absent in 56% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had oxyntocardiac mucosa, in which glands contained a mixture of mucous and parietal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac and oxyntocardiac mucosae were present only in part of the circumference of the junction in 50% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The measured maximum length of cardiac plus oxyntocardiac mucosa was less than 0.5 cm in 76% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for the presence and extent of cardiac mucosa to increase with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac mucosa at the junction is therefore frequently absent, has considerable individual variation, is very small in extent when present, is commonly absent from some part of the circumference of the junction, and increases in prevalence and length with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These characteristics of cardiac mucosa make it highly unlikely that it is a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We develop the hypothesis that cardiac mucosa represents an early histologic manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
