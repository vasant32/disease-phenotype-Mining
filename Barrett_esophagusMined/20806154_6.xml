<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the interobserver reliability in the endoscopic diagnosis and grading of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Video clips of endoscopy in 21 patients with/without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were used for training (n = 3) and for diagnosis/grading (n = 18) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> by endoscopists from seven hospitals in Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was graded using the Prague C &amp; M Criteria whereby the circumferential extent of the Barrett's segment (C value), maximum extent of Barrett's segment (M value), location of the gastroesophageal junction, and location of the diaphragmatic hiatus were scored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intraclass correlation coefficients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) were calculated as a measure of interobserver reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 34 endoscopists participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> values for the scores of the C value, M value, location of the gastroesophageal junction, and location of the diaphragmatic hiatus were: 0.92 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.88 - 0.97), 0.94 (95 %CI 0.90 - 0.98), 0.86 (95 %CI 0.78 - 0.94), and 0.81 (95 %CI 0.71 - 0.92), respectively, indicating excellent interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences in region/country, endoscopists' experience, case volume of participating centers, or primary practice type had no significant effect on the reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> values for recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of &gt; or = 1 cm were 0.90 (95 %CI 0.80 - 1.00) and 0.92 (95 %CI 0.87 - 0.98) for the C and M values, respectively, whereas the corresponding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> values for Barrett's segment of &lt; 1 cm were 0.18 (95 %CI 0.03 - 0.32) and 0.21 (95 %CI 0.00 - 0.51), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the uncommon occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in Asia, our endoscopists exhibited excellent agreement in the endoscopic diagnosis and grading of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> using the Prague C &amp; M Criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in view of the low interobserver reliability in recognizing Barrett's segments of &lt; 1 cm, future studies in Asia should take this into account when selecting the study population </plain></SENT>
