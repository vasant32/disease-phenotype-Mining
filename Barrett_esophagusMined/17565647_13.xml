<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is diagnosed when specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) is detected histologically in endoscopically suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> and plays a pivotal role in the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has traditionally been believed to affect Asians less frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of BE and possible associated risk factors in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 70 103 patients who had undergone their first upper endoscopies was performed using computerized medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 696 (1%) patients had suspected CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After screening by telephone, 480 were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical and endoscopic characteristics of histologically identifiable BE and endoscopically suspected CLE not confirmed by biopsy (suspected CLE without SIM) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was present in 151 patients (0.22%) with a mean age of 53.8 +/- 10.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BE was more commonly found in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BE was associated with a set of features distinct from suspected CLE without SIM; older age, greater predominance of male sex, more frequent smoking history, and more frequent acid regurgitation symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> remains less common in Korea than in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Old age, male sex, smoking, and acid regurgitation symptom were significant risk factors </plain></SENT>
