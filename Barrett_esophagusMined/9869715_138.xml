<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This report presents clinical results of photodynamic therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred patients including 13 with superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Light (630 nm) was endoscopically delivered to the esophageal mucosa by a diffuser or a windowed esophageal centering balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nd:YAG laser was required to ablate small residual areas of Barrett's mucosa during-long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were maintained on <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> and were followed for 4 to 84 months (mean 19 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Conversion of approximately 75% to 80% of treated Barrett's mucosa to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; complete elimination of Barrett's mucosa was noted in 43 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was eliminated in 78 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> developed during follow-up in 11 of 48 patients in untreated Barrett's mucosa requiring additional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 13 malignancies were ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>Esophageal strictures</z:hpo> occurred in 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Use of longer centering balloons reduced the incidence of strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Photodynamic therapy alone or with Nd:YAG laser thermal ablation combined with long-term acid inhibition provides an effective endoscopic therapy to (1) eliminate Barrett's mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> and (2) reduce the extent of and, in some cases, eliminate Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
