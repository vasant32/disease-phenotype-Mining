<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new imaging technology which can perform high-resolution, cross-sectional imaging of the internal microstructure of biological tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OCT is analogous to ultrasound, except that it measures the intensity of back-reflected infrared light rather than sound waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OCT performs two- and three-dimensional imaging of tissue microstructure in situ and in real time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It can achieve image resolutions approaching the cellular level over approximately the same imaging depths as a conventional biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this article we examine the feasibility of OCT for high-resolution imaging of gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with ex-vivo imaging of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathologic microstructures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue, both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic, was obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection after an initial diagnosis of a gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The tissue samples were imaged prior to fixation using a laboratory OCT system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The OCT system consists of a fiber optic-based Michelson interferometer, a commercially available amplified superluminscent light source, and a computer for data acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The images were subsequently compared with histological cross-sections corresponding to the imaged areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The stratified squamous epithelium of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus was clearly visible in the OCT images and contrasted to the disorganized and non-uniform nature of the mucosal layers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The columnar epithelial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> as well as other mucosal structures in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon were distinctly visible using OCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, disorganization of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal layers and ulcerative lesions were identified in tissues from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ability of OCT to image tissue microstructure at high resolutions makes it a potentially powerful technology for minimally invasive assessment of the gastrointestinal tract and the evaluation of early neoplastic changes </plain></SENT>
