<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose we assessed <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in distal esophageal biopsies of controls, patients with various grades of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with and without severe associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and patients following Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The total amount of oxygen-derived free radicals was measured by chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Membrane damage caused by free radicals was assessed by analysis of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we measured esophageal mucosal tissue levels of the free radical scavenger <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Chemiluminescence and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation increased with the grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and were highest in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings following Nissen fundoplication were similar to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase decreased as the grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> increased being lowest in Barrett's patients with severe associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase levels were found in Barrett's mucosa with mild associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> is mediated by free radicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Barrett's is a severe form of oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Antireflux surgery prevents oxidative damage of the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase is consumed by esophageal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In some patients with Barrett's, high <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase levels of the esophageal mucosa may prevent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
