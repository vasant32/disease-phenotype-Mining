<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis of 258 patients, from 1985 to 1991, undergoing curative esophagogastrectomy for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 134) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (n = 124) was performed to test the hypothesis that histologic cell type is an independent prognostic factor and to identify other predictors of survival after resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The actuarial overall survival (p = 0.16) and disease-specific survival (p = 0.68) were similar for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (median overall survival = 27 months) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (median overall survival = 22 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis identified T stage, N stage, number of diseased nodes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site, and blood transfusions as significant (p &lt; 0.05) variables in predicting overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was not predictive of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that T stage (p = 0.006), N stage (p = 0.01), and number of diseased lymph nodes (p = 0.03) were independent predictors of overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This analysis demonstrated that histologic type is not an independent variable for overall survival in patients undergoing curative esophagogastrectomy for <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome is most strongly influenced by extent of disease defined by T and N stage </plain></SENT>
