<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal precancerous conditions</z:e> is recommended, no analogous guidelines exist for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to estimate the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of treatment and endoscopic surveillance to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors developed a state-transition decision model for a cohort of US men with a recent incidental diagnosis of gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strategies included 1) no surveillance or treatment and 2) referral for surveillance and treatment, and varied by surveillance frequency (none, every 10 years, every 5 years, or every year) and treatment modality for dysplastic and cancerous lesions (surgery or endoscopic mucosal resection [EMR]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The term "post-treatment surveillance" was restricted to surveillance of individuals after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were based on published literature and databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included lifetime <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> risk, quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For a cohort of men with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> aged 50 years, the lifetime <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> risk was 5.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EMR with annual surveillance reduced the lifetime <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk by 90% and cost $39,800 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addition of post-treatment surveillance every 10 years provided little incremental benefit ( approximately 5%) but cost &gt;$1 million per QALY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results were most sensitive to surgical risks and the proportion of lesions completely removed with EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, surveillance every 10 years reduced lifetime <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk by 61% and cost $544,500 per QALY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EMR with surveillance every 1 to 5 years for gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was promising for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary cancer</z:e> prevention and had a cost-effectiveness ratio that would be considered attractive in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance of less advanced lesions did not appear to be cost-effective, except possibly for immigrants from high-risk countries </plain></SENT>
