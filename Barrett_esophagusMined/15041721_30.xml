<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates immune defense mechanisms and hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, IL-6 may also be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-6 has been shown to inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major aim of this study was to evaluate expression of IL-6 in BE at the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we tested whether proteins that are associated with IL-6 signaling, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and two antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, are also expressed in the same tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Biopsies of duodenum, BE, and squamous epithelium were evaluated by using a human cytokine protein array, ELISA, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased IL-6 levels were found to be secreted from BE tissue compared with duodenum or squamous epithelium from sites adjacent or 5 cm away from the BE lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-6 mRNA was also elevated in BE compared with duodenum or squamous epithelium in five of seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies confirmed IL-6 expression in intestinal glandular epithelium in BE tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, Mcl-1, and Bcl-x(L) are present at higher levels in BE glands, with lower levels being found in duodenum or squamous epithelium CONCLUSIONS: These data, taken together, suggest that elevated IL-6 levels in BE may contribute to the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance, thereby placing this epithelium at higher risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
