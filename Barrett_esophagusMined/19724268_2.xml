<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a nationwide cohort of patients with BE in the Netherlands with long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients diagnosed with BE between 1991 and 2006 were identified in the Dutch nationwide histopathology registry (Pathologisch Anatomisch Landelijk Geautomatiseerd Archief (PALGA)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> observed in these patients was compared with that in the general Dutch population aged &gt;40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using a Poisson model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 42,207 patients with a first diagnosis of BE were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 5.6 years (s.d </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of those <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, 317 (44%) were detected within the first year after initial BE diagnosis, and 396 (54%) thereafter </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk within the first year of follow-up after BE diagnosis (RR: 4.76 (95% CI: 4.26-5.31)) was significantly higher than within 1-5 years of follow-up (RR: 0.99 (95% CI: 0.86-1.14)) or more than 5 years of follow-up (RR: 1.28 (95% CI: 1.11-1.47)) (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study shows an overall increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients with BE as compared with the general Dutch population, which can for the greater part be explained by diagnostic bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the association between BE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> does not merit a more extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening strategy in BE patients than has currently been recommended for the general population </plain></SENT>
