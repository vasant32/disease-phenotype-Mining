<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The investigation was performed on the specimens obtained from patients, including 41 males and 29 females, aged 16 to 81 years, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) at endoscopic biopsies and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An immunohistological study was carried out using monoclonal antibodies to Cl 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 ("Zymed") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The location of a reaction product was defined in the epithelial membranes and cytoplasm (diffuse staining) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 6 groups: 1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (a control group, n = 10); 2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> (n = 15); 3) BE with enteric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (EM) without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 9); 4) BE with colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (CM) without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 9); 5) BE with varying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (the latter being detected in the presence of CM (n = 10); 6) AC in the presence of BE (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transition of low- to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and to AC into BE was established to be accompanied by TJ loss, as appeared as disappearance of apical staining of Cl 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7; moreover, their cytoplasmic staining increased in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lost capacity of accumulating Cl in the area of TJ in AC to BE led to the elimination of BE and promoted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> (proliferation, invasion, and metastatic spread) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The markers of cell differentiation of Cl 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 may be recommended for determination of the malignant potential of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to BE </plain></SENT>
