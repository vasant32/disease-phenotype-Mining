<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE)-associated esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover genomic alterations during BE pathogenesis and progression to EAC, but treatment-naive surgical specimens are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to establish the feasibility of using widely available endoscopic mucosal biopsies for successful NGS, using samples obtained from a BE 'progressor' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paired-end whole-genome NGS was performed on the Illumina platform using libraries generated from mucosal biopsies of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium (NSE), BE and EAC obtained from a patient who progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> during endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selective validation studies, including Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry and functional assays, were performed to confirm the NGS findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NGS identified somatic nonsense mutations of AT-rich interactive domain 1A (SWI like) (ARID1A) and PPIE and an additional 37 missense mutations in BE and/or EAC, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ARID1A mutations were detected in 15% (3/20) high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD)/EAC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry performed on an independent archival cohort demonstrated ARID1A protein loss in 0% (0/76), 4.9% (2/40), 14.3% (4/28), 16.0% (8/50) and 12.2% (12/98) of NSE, BE, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, HGD and EAC tissues, respectively, and was inversely associated with nuclear p53 accumulation (P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enhanced cell growth, proliferation and invasion were observed on ARID1A knockdown in EAC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, genes downstream of ARID1A that potentially contribute to the ARID1A knockdown phenotype were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our studies establish the feasibility of using mucosal biopsies for NGS, which should enable the comparative analysis of larger 'progressor' versus 'non-progressor' cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further, we identify ARID1A as a novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene in BE pathogenesis, reiterating the importance of aberrant chromatin in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> sequence.Oncogene advance online publication, 14 January 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.586 </plain></SENT>
