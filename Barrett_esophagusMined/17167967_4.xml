<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is based on histologic demonstration of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the distal esophagus in a population submitted to gastroscopy not selected for reflux disease, and with columnar lined distal esophagus between 0.5 and 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four biopsies in the distal esophagus were done in 224 patients undergoing routine gastroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were not selected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other clinical parameters were recorded to assess any possible association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four Centers 224 patients received endoscopy with biopsies demonstrating specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in 21% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was present among the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, as well as with reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant association was present in over 70 (females), as well as with the presence of antral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> demonstrated in 45 patients by gastric biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No other significant associations were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samplings can diagnose the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> during endoscopy in patients endoscopically suspected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>: at present there is not clear evidence to promote this screening to achieve mortality reduction of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
