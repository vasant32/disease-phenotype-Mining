<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective study to determine whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi> sensitivity, as determined by an in vitro assay, was associated with the future development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, which is associated with increased risk of progression to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> in peripheral blood lymphocytes in a cohort of 220 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We followed these patients for 1,230 person-years (range, 3 months to 10.1 years; median, 6.4 years), using development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> as end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subset of these patients was evaluated for inactivation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor genes CDKN2A/p16 and TP53 [by mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH)] in their Barrett's segments at the time of, or before, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> test, and the patients were stratified by CDKN2A/p16 and TP53 status in an analysis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi> sensitivity and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">Bleomycin</z:chebi>-sensitive patients were found to be at significantly greater risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-9.53) and nonsignificantly greater risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-3.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with detectable LOH at the TP53 locus (on chromosome 17p), increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> sensitivity was associated with increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (P(trend) &lt; 0.001) and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (P(trend) = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesis that sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi> increases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, particularly those with 17p LOH including TP53 </plain></SENT>
