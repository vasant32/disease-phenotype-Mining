<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Now the 7q32.3-q36.1 region was additionally characterized by allelotype analysis with 11 polymorphic markers in 15 METs, 20 LGDs, 20 HGDs, and 20 Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> from different patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low percentages of imbalance were determined in METs and LGDs, 7% and 10%, respectively, whereas HGDs and Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> revealed high percentages of loss, 75% and 65%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference in frequency between LGDs and HGDs appeared highly significant: P = 0.00007 </plain></SENT>
