<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Barrett's mucosa is a risk factor for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and should be detected at an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is defined by the presence of columnar epithelium with goblet cells in the lower esophagus, but histologic diagnosis can be uncertain in the absence of distinct goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated 55 biopsies from 48 patients with endoscopically plain <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and performed immunohistochemistry for CDX2 and MUC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, alcian blue (pH 2,5)/<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> staining was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In histologically unequivocal Barrett's mucosa, nuclear expression of CDX2 in goblet cells and many columnar cells, as well as cytoplasmic positivity for MUC2 in goblet cells, could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alcian blue (pH 2,5)/<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> stained acidic mucins in goblet cells and in some non-goblet columnar cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six cases, no definite Barrett's mucosa was present, and no expression of MUC2 could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these biopsies, there was granular cytoplasmic and/or focal nuclear staining for CDX2 in non-goblet columnar epithelial cells, indicating their intestinal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this peculiar mucosa is the precursor of unequivocal Barrett's mucosa and would designate it early Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alcian blue for acidic mucins is inconsistent in this epithelium and does not reliably indicate early intestinal differentiation </plain></SENT>
