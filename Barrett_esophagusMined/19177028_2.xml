<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic surveillance of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined oesophagus</z:e> (CLO) may identify those with early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The benefits of surveillance are unproven and there is little evidence to support recommendations for precise endoscopic intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine surveillance practice for CLO in the UK and the impact of endoscopic intervals on detection of dysplastic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight hundred and seventeen patients with CLO, registered with the UK National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> registry and undergoing surveillance were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic intervals were calculated and frequency of detection of dysplastic disease analysed using chi2 test of association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors affecting surveillance intervals were analysed using multiple linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 94.7% of patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), 95.0% with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and 71.4% with AC were diagnosed on surveillance endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean endoscopic surveillance intervals varied between the centres from 1.07 to 1.63 years for nondysplastic CLO; 0.69-1.19 years for LGD, and 0.35-1.17 years for HGD; with overall mean surveillance intervals of 1.29, 1.01 and 0.44 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When LGD was surveyed, significantly higher proportions of HGD/AC were detected at intervals of 3 months or less (P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Shorter endoscopic intervals were significantly associated with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014866" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophageal strictures</z:e> (P=0.002), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (P=0.046), increasing patient age (P&lt;0.001) and higher grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> surveyed (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A variation in surveillance practice for CLO was observed throughout the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A large proportion of dysplastic disease is detected on specific surveillance endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Shorter endoscopic intervals for surveillance of LGD are associated with an increased detection of HGD/AC </plain></SENT>
