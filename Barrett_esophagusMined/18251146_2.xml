<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Between January 1999 and December 2004, 21 patients with histological proven, short BE and scheduled for fundoplication, were treated by APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment was repeated until histological confirmation of complete ablation was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent surgical correction of reflux by Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response to treatment was assessed at follow up with endoscopy every 6 to 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE ablation was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after a mean of 3.6 APC sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no mortality and morbidity was 19% (4/21 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent 360 degrees Nissen fundoplication as antireflux procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no operative mortality and no major complications requiring re-operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively 17/21 patients had at least one endoscopic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean observation time was 17.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1258085" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barrett epithelium</z:e> was observed in 6 patients at a mean of 9.6 months after fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the combination of APC and fundoplication is a safe and effective treatment option for most patients with uncomplicated BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development was observed, larger studies with a longer follow up are required to assess the impact of APC on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
