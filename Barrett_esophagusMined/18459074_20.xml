<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Yearly surveillance endoscopy is carried out for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) so that progression to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> can be detected at the earliest stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of circumferential ablation followed by focal ablation (HALO system) for eliminating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with 2 - 6 cm of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with histology demonstrating LGD on their last two sequential endoscopies over the previous 2 years and confirmed by two pathologists were enrolled in this prospective, single-center trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circumferential ablation was carried out at baseline and at 4 months (if residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> present) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy with 4-quadrant biopsies every 1 cm was performed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 1 year, focal ablation was applied to any visible <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or irregularity of the squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> 30 mg bid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete responses for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (CR-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CR-IM) at 2-year follow-up, with complete response defined as "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsies negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>" were the main outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients (nine men, mean age 66.9 years, range 48 - 79) with confirmed LGD (median 4.4 cm, range 3 - 6) underwent circumferential ablation with focal ablation after 1 year as necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 2 years, CR-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 100 % and CR-IM was 90 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no strictures or buried <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A stepwise regimen of circumferential ablation followed by focal ablation appears to eradicate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (90 % CR-IM) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (100 % CR-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) at 2-year follow-up in this trial, without stricture formation or buried <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
