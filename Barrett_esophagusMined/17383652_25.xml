<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been used for high-resolution endoscopic imaging and diagnosis of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relatively slow image-acquisition rate of the present OCT systems inhibits wide-field imaging and limits the clinical utility of OCT for diagnostic imaging in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study describes a new optical imaging technology, optical frequency-domain imaging (OFDI), derived from OCT, that enables comprehensive imaging of large esophageal segments with microscopic resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prototype OFDI system was developed for endoscopic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The system was used in combination with a balloon-centering catheter to comprehensively image the distal esophagus in swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Volumetric images of the mucosa and portions of the muscularis propria were obtained for 4.5-cm-long segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Image resolution was 7 microm in depth and 30 microm parallel to the lumen, and provided clear delineation of each mucosal layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3-dimensional data sets were used to create cross-sectional microscopic images, as well as vascular maps of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Submucosal vessels and capillaries were visualized by using Doppler-flow processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive microscopic imaging of the distal esophagus in vivo by using OFDI is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The unique capabilities of this technology for obtaining detailed information of tissue microstructure over large mucosal areas may open up new possibilities for improving the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
