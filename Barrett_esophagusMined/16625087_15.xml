<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Little is known regarding the significance of esophageal biopsies that show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-like atypia limited to the bases of the crypts, without involvement of the surface epithelium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical, pathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular characteristics of basal crypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-like atypia (BCDA) with surface maturation in surveillance endoscopic mucosal biopsies to gain insight into its biologic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Seattle <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> Project is a prospective cohort study in which patients and their biopsies have been evaluated prospectively for clinical, pathologic, and molecular markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As part of continued surveillance of the cohort, 206 consecutive BE patients were evaluated prospectively for BCDA between July 1, 2001 and August 13, 2003; 15 patients had BCDA (prevalence rate = 7.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These 15 patients were evaluated for clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical (p53 and MIB-1) features during the study period (2001-2003) as well as associations with clinical, pathologic, and molecular markers [17p(TP53) loss of heterozygosity (LOH), 9p(p16) LOH, tetraploidy, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>] that were detected previously in the same patients in the cohort study (1983-2001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BE patients with BCDA (male-to female ratio, 12:3; mean age, 72 years; mean length of BE, 7.0 cm; mean duration of BE, 95.1 months), except 2 (87%), had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> detected in biopsies either prior to or concurrent to the one that contained BCDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 112 of 191 (59%) controls had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> during the same time period (59%, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference between BCDA and controls was particularly significant with regard to the association with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with adjacent nonatypical and nondysplastic (metaplastic) BE, areas of BCDA showed a significantly elevated prevalence rate of p53 positivity (60% vs. 13%, P&lt;0.02) and a significantly elevated total crypt and basal crypt MIB-1 proliferation rate (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the MIB-1 proliferation rate in the basal portion of the crypts in BCDA was similar to that detected in conventional low- or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with BCDA showed a significantly increased rate of 17p(TP53) LOH (P = 0.016), <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (P = 0.004), and a trend in increased 9p(p16) LOH (P = 0.08), compared with control patients without BCDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical, pathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular abnormalities were similar in BCDA cases that were considered low-grade versus those considered high-grade by histologic evaluation, except that high-grade cases tended to be older (79 years vs. 68 years, P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BCDA with surface maturation, in mucosal biopsies from patients with BE, is an uncommon but significant pathologic change that shows a variety of proliferative and molecular abnormalities and has a high association with conventional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, BCDA warrants further investigation as a possible subtype of true <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> despite the morphologic appearance of surface maturation </plain></SENT>
