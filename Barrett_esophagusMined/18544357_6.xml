<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The earliest response of esophageal mucosa to gastric reflux is the development of oxidative damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These processes contribute to the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> known as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, as well as the progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secretory phospholipase A(2) is a mediator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> with levels that are increased in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> when compared with levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our goal is to determine the role of secretory phospholipase A(2) in the development of reflux-associated changes in the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Secretory phospholipase A(2)-deficient mice (C57BL/6, n = 5) and mice known to express high levels of secretory phospholipase A(2) (BALB/c, n = 5) underwent side-to-side surgical anastomosis of the first portion of the duodenum and gastroesophageal junction, allowing exposure of esophageal mucosa to duodenal and gastric contents duodeno-gastroesophageal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control animals (n = 5) of each strain underwent laparotomy with esophagotomy and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue was frozen in embedding medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining and Ki67 and secretory phospholipase A(2) immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate esophageal tissue and its response to duodeno-gastroesophageal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunofluorescent staining confirmed the absence of secretory phospholipase A(2) in C57BL/6 mice and its presence in BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining demonstrated significant thickening of the esophageal mucosa in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in the presence of secretory phospholipase A(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mice known to express high levels of secretory phospholipase A(2) also demonstrated increased numbers of proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Secretory phospholipase A(2)-deficient mice were immune to the early changes induced by mixed reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of secretory phospholipase A(2) appears necessary for early histologic changes produced by exposure of the esophagus to gastroduodenal contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This enzyme is identified as a promising target for evaluation of mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and chemoprevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
