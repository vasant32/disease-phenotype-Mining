<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the discriminative value of Rome III questionnaire-based diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> is yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objectives: To evaluate the Rome III questionnaire for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> and whether it can discriminate between postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) in patients with dyspeptic symptoms </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gastro-duodenal biopsies, liver function tests and ultrasound were done to establish the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 272 patients with upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms without alarm features, who were enrolled in the study, a total of 191 (70%) fulfilled the criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> based upon Rome III questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EPS subgroup was found in 109 (57%), PDS in 17 (9%) patients, overlap between EPS and PDS was present in 56 (29%) patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> was established in 136/191 (71%) patients only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>Gastritis</z:hpo> was present in 116 patients (85%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Duodenitis</z:e> in 44 (32%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> in 70 (51%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among 55 patients (29%) who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0683324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organic diseases</z:e>, EPS was seen in 35 (64%), PDS in 5 (9%) and overlap in 15 (27%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Underlying organic causes were gastric or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo> in 14 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> in five, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> in seven, <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gall stones</z:mp> in five, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017536" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Giardiasis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> in three each </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Almost one-third of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">functional dyspepsia</z:e> did not qualify for one of the two subgroups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> of Rome III </plain></SENT>
