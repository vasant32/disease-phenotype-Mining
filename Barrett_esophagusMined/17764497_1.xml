<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Unsedated, ultrathin esophagoscopy has been shown to be tolerable, safe, and accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Survey data have suggested that accessibility of unsedated esophagoscopy would increase referrals for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate primary-care physician referrals for BE screening when unsedated esophagoscopy is made available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied primary-care referrals for unsedated esophagoscopy in a VA internal medicine clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients over age 45 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> heartburn for &gt;5 yr or &gt;3 times weekly and who had no previous EGD were eligible for screening with unsedated esophagoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> primary providers received a 15-min education session on screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline referral rate was determined retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal data were then collected during three phases of the study: (a) primary provider-initiated referrals, (b) primary provider-initiated referrals with weekly reminders from investigators, and (c) investigator recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline referral rate averaged 0.5 patients per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Availability of unsedated esophagoscopy and an education session increased the rate of referral to 0.66 patients per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Weekly reminders to primary physicians further increased the rate to 1.33 referrals per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Investigator recruitment produced a rate of 2.67 referrals per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 77 patients offered screening, 25 (32%) declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 52 patients screened, three (5.8%) were diagnosed with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Accessibility of unsedated esophagoscopy itself does not lead to a large increase in the number of primary care referrals for BE screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Factors that prevent primary care physicians from referring patients for screening need to be identified and effective interventions to change referral patterns need to be implemented for unsedated screening programs to be successful </plain></SENT>
