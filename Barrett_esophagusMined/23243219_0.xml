<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is problematic because <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/early-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is frequently invisible and likely to be missed because of sampling bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular abnormalities may be more diffuse than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was therefore to test whether DNA methylation, especially on imprinted and X-chromosome genes, is able to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/early-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 27K methylation arrays were used to find genes best able to differentiate between 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and 24 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were validated using pyrosequencing on a retrospective cohort (60 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 36 dysplastic, and 90 EAC) and then in a prospective multicenter study (98 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients, including 28 dysplastic and 9 early EAC) designed to utilize biomarkers to stratify patients according to their prevalent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/EAC status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genes (23%) on the array, including 7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> and 69% of imprinted genes, have shown statistically significant changes in methylation in EAC versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (Wilcoxon P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>6/7 selected candidate genes were successfully internally (Pearson's P &lt; 0.01) and externally validated (ANOVA P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four genes (SLC22A18, PIGR, GJA12, and RIN2) showed the greatest area under curve (0.988) to distinguish between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/EAC in the retrospective cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This methylation panel was able to stratify patients from the prospective cohort into three risk groups based on the number of genes methylated (low risk: &lt;2 genes, intermediate: 2, and high: &gt;2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Widespread DNA methylation changes were observed in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> including â‰ˆ70% of known imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A four-gene methylation panel stratified patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> into three risk groups with potential clinical utility </plain></SENT>
