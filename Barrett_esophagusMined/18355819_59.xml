<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The management strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) that contains high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) include intensive endoscopic surveillance, photodynamic therapy, thermal ablation, EMR, and esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic circumferential balloon-based ablation by using radiofrequency energy for treating BE HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Multicenter U.S. registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Sixteen academic and community centers; treatment period from September 2004 to March 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients with histologic evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) that contained HGD confirmed by at least 2 expert pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A prior EMR was permitted, provided that residual HGD remained in the BE region for ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Endoscopic circumferential ablation with follow-up esophageal biopsies to assess the histologic response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES: Histologic complete response (CR) end points: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy specimen fragments obtained at the last biopsy session were negative for HGD (CR-HGD), (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy specimens were negative for any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (CR-D), and (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy specimens were negative for IM (CR-IM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 142 patients (median age 66 years, interquartile range [IQR] 59-75 years) who had BE HGD (median length 6 cm, IQR 3-8 cm) underwent circumferential ablation (median 1 session, IQR 1-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse events were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was 1 asymptomatic stricture and no buried glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two patients had at least 1 follow-up biopsy session (median follow-up 12 months, IQR 8-15 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A CR-HGD was achieved in 90.2% of patients, CR-D in 80.4%, and CR-IM in 54.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: A nonrandomized study design, without a control arm, a lack of centralized pathology review, ablation and biopsy technique not standardized, and a relatively short-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic circumferential ablation is a promising modality for the treatment of BE that contains HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this multicenter registry, the intervention safely achieved a CR for HGD in 90.2% of patients at a median of 12 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
