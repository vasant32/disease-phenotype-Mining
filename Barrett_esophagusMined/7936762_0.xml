<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) the definition of a sub-group of patients at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of the metaplastic epithelium is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Undoubtedly, the histological evaluation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is the most important and objective parameter to identify a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to obtain additional data a group of cell proliferation markers was applied in dysplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied PCNA in a selected group of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred six biopsies were examined, referring to fifty five patients with BE, who were followed up for a period of at least one year (1-5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed one or more biopsies positive for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PCNA was detected immunohistochemically on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded biopsies, and positive cells were evaluated in a crude percent count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results showed a remarkable number of PCNA positive cells in high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and a variable amount of PCNA positive cells in the others groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was an overlap in the number of positive cases between low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (30%), indefinite (33%) and negative (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the assessment of S-phase cells correlated with the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> seems to be of limited practical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation is probably affected by many factors and mainly <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
