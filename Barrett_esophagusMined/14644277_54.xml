<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The literature is limited regarding the combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic approach to esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy for the treatment of benign and malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective chart review of 46 consecutive minimally invasive esophagectomies performed between August 1998 and September 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications for esophagectomy were <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (n = 38), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 3), and recalcitrant stricture (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 38 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> 23 (61%) had neoadjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were operative time, blood loss, length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, conversion rate, morbidity, mortality, pathology, disease recurrence, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approaches to esophagectomy were thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy (n = 41), thoracoscopic and laparoscopic Ivor Lewis resection (n = 3), abdominal only laparoscopic esophagogastrectomy (n = 1), and hand-assisted laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Minimally invasive esophagectomy was successfully completed in 45 (97.8%) of 46 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean operative time was 350 +/- 75 minutes and the mean blood loss was 279 +/- 184 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median length of intensive care unit stay was 2 days and median length of stay was 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Major complications occurred in 17.4% of patients and minor complications occurred in 10.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Late complications were seen in 26.1% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality was 4.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among the 38 patients who underwent esophagectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> the 3-year survival was 57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In a mean followup of 26 months there was no trocar site or neck wound recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A thoracoscopic and laparoscopic approach to esophagectomy is technically feasible and safe for the treatment of benign and malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>With a mean followup of 26 months thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy appears to be an oncologically acceptable surgical approach for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
