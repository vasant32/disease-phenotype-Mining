<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the variables that predict outcome of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis was performed on data from 199 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variables included age, sex, body mass index, primary symptoms, clinical response to acid suppression therapy, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 24-hour esophageal pH score, and the percentage of time the esophageal pH was less than 4 on 24-hour pH monitoring, lower esophageal sphincter competence, status of the esophageal body motility, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of cardiac epithelium limited to the gastroesophageal junction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of any length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at a median follow-up of 15 months (range 6 to 74 months) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy-three patients had an excellent or good outcome (87%) and 26 had a fair or poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three factors were significantly predictive of a successful outcome: an abnormal 24-hour pH score (odds ratio = 5.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>9-15.3), a typical primary symptom (odds ratio = 5.1; 95% CI = 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>9-13.6), and a clinical response to acid suppression therapy (odds ratio = 3.3; 95% CI = 1.3-8.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 24-hour pH monitoring provides the strongest outcome predictor of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication and that outcome is based more on the correct identification of the disease than on its severity </plain></SENT>
