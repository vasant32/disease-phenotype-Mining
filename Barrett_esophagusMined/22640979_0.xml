<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, such procedures generally induce inflammatory repair resulting in a fibrotic stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> (NAC) is an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> that has shown some efficacy against pulmonary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001395'>hepatic fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate the benefit of NAC in the prevention of esophageal cicatricial stricture after CESD in a swine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS AND METHODS: Two groups of six pigs each were subjected to general anesthesia and CESD: after randomization, a first group received an oral NAC treatment regimen of 100 mg/kg/day, initiated one week before the procedure, whereas a second group was followed without any prophylactic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up endoscopies took place seven, fourteen, twenty-one, and twenty-eight days after CESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Necropsy, histological assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were performed on day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median esophageal lumen diameter on day 21 (main judgment criterion) was 4 mm (range 2 to 5) in group 1 and 3 mm (range 1 to 7) in group 2 (P = 0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding clinical evaluation (time before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005240'>esophageal obstruction</z:hpo>), number of dilations, <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> damage on immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effect, systemic administration of NAC did not show significant benefit on esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in our animal model of esophageal wound healing within the experimental conditions of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since the administered doses were relatively high, it seems unlikely that NAC might be a valuable option for the prevention of post-endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
