<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of distal oesophagus and gastric cardia, probably arising from areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, has been increasing rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To define prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of distal oesophagus, oesophagogastric junction and gastric cardia and to evaluate potential associated factors, by means of a prospective multicentre study including University and teaching hospitals, and primary and tertiary care centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Each of 24 institutions involved in study enrolled 10 consecutive patients undergoing first-time routine endoscopy for dyspeptic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients answered symptom questionnaires and underwent gastroscopy Three biopsies were taken from distal oesophagus, oesophago-gastric junction and gastric cardia, and were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens were also evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 240 patients (124 male, 116 female; median age 56 years, range 20-90) were enrolled in study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> affected distal oesophagus in 5, oesophago-gastric junction in 19 and gastric cardia in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found at distal oesophagus and/or oesophago-gastric junction of 3/24 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> vs 2/216 without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between symptoms and presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, regardless of location, and between <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at oesophago-gastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of distal oesophagus, oesophagogastric-junction and gastric cardia is found in a significant proportion of symptomatic patients undergoing gastroscopy and is associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> seems to decrease when specialized columnar epithelium is found in short segment, or even focally in oesophago-gastric junction, these small foci of intestinal metaplastic cells may represent source of most <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of cardia </plain></SENT>
