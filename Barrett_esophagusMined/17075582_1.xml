<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to use computerized morphometry in order to differentiate between the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and to predict progression to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biopsies from 97 patients with BE graded by a consensus forum of expert gastrointestinal pathologists were available for morphometrical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study group included 36 biopsies negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND), none of which progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; 16 indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (IND) and 21 low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), of which three progressed in each group and 24 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), of which 15 progressed to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computerized morphometry was used for measuring indices of size, shape, texture, symmetry and architectural distribution of the epithelial nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was best differentiated from the ND group by nuclear pseudostratification (P=0.036), pleomorphism (P&lt;0.01), and chromatin texture (margination, P&lt;0.01) and from the HGD group by nuclear area (P&lt;0.01), pleomorphism (P&lt;0.01), chromatin texture (margination, P&lt;0.01), symmetry (P&lt;0.01), and orientation (P=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results were validated on a new set of cases (n=55) using a neural network model, resulting in an accuracy of 89% for differentiating between the ND and LGD groups and 86% for differentiating between the LGD and HGD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the HGD group, univariate significant predictors of the progression interval to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were: indices of nuclear texture (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>: P=0.0019, s.d.-OD: P=0.005) and orientation: P=0.022 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nuclear texture (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) was the only independent predictor of progression (P=0.004, hazard=11.54) by Cox's multivariate test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study proposes that computerized morphometry is a valid tool for determining the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, histomorphometric quantification of nuclear texture is a powerful tool for predicting progression to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients with HGD </plain></SENT>
