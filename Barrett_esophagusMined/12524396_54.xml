<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: C-myc over expression is implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> although to date this has not been studied in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine c-myc expression in the malignant progression of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and whether it may be induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> seen in gastro-oesophageal refluxate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C-myc protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were assessed in 20 Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and 20 oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> samples by western blotting and real time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of c-myc and proliferation were also assessed in cell lines OE21, OE33, SW-480, and TE-7 stimulated with pulses or continuous exposure to the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">chenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: C-myc protein was upregulated in 50% of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and 90% of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> samples compared with squamous, gastric, and duodenal controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C-myc immunolocalisation in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> revealed discrete nuclear localisation, becoming more diffuse with progression from low to high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both continual and pulsed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> induced c-myc at pH 4, with no effect at pH 7 or with acidified media alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulsed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> treatment induced proliferation (p&lt;0.05); in contrast, continuous exposure led to suppression of proliferation (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have shown upregulation of c-myc with malignant progression of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and suggest that acidified bile may be a novel agent responsible for induction of this oncogene </plain></SENT>
