<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Although the literature on fundoplications in childhood is relatively extensive, only few reports exist which correlate the rate of complications with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other important questions such as the incidence of postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dumping syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in childhood are barely treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nor have operative techniques such as single or double-row cuff sutures or the benefit of performing pylorotomy or pyloroplasty in addition to fundoplication been investigated with respect to their recurrence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular studies on laparoscopic fundoplications tend to be generally confined to a discussion of the feasibility of the endoscopic procedure, the duration of the intervention, the length of the hospital stay and the costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study presented here aims to analyze such still unanswered questions listed above for open fundoplication procedures, including an analysis of the authors' own patient population, and to discuss the questions together with the most important reports in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim is to create a basis for later studies which will compare conventional and laparoscopic fundoplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the period between 1993 and 2005, 160 children underwent a fundoplication procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From 2003 onwards, fundoplications were carried out laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data of 148 patients were analyzed, some of them on the basis of clinical follow-up and some on the basis of an extensive questionnaire and among others with the help of the parents' support group KEKS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The underlying disease in 87 patients was reflux disease stemming from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo>, previous diaphragmatic operation in 8 children and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>swallowing difficulties</z:hpo> in 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 23 patients suffered from isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> without an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative complications occurred in 4.6 % of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> (EA), while the rate for the remaining collective of patients was 1.6 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications were observed in 10.3 % of the children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> and in 8.2 % of the other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate was 16.1 % in the children with EA and 6.5 % in the other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> and/or stenosis occurred in 17.2 % and 6.5 % of children, respectively, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dumping syndrome</z:e> was observed in 18.3 % of the EA group and only in 1.6 % of the comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>An evaluation of 79 esophageal biopsies showed no difference between patients with EA and the comparison group concerning the degree of histological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>When evaluating the suturing technique, it was found that a double-row fundus suture was more effective in preventing reflux recurrence than a single-row suture but also resulted in an increased rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>When considering the not infrequent occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dumping syndrome</z:e>, it was found that drainage operations such as pyloroplasty or pyloromyotomy are only indicated for reduced gastric motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The data of the children without EA, who initially served as a comparison group, was analyzed further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Four summaries of the current literature in table form complete this discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Particularly in children with EA, Nissen fundoplication cannot be considered a procedure with few complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The problems resulting from disturbed gastric and esophageal motility should not be underestimated nor should the postoperative occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dumping syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Postoperative long-term follow-up until the patients reach adulthood is absolutely necessary to ensure that development of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is not overlooked </plain></SENT>
