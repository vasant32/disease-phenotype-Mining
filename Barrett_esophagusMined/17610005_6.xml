<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of differing light doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with HGD in BE received oral ALA (60 mg/kg) activated by low (500 J/cm), medium (750 J/cm), high (1,000 J/cm), or highest (1,000 J/cm x2) light dose at 635 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was by regular endoscopy with quadrantic biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successful eradication of HGD was significantly correlated with light dose (log rank, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of eight patients (75%) treated with the highest light dose, one of two treated with high dose (50%), two of nine (22%) receiving medium light dose, and zero of five receiving low light dose had successful eradication of HGD (median follow-up 45 months, range 1-78 months) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> for eradication of HGD in BE is closely related to the light dose used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a drug dose of 60 mg/kg and light at 635 nm, we recommend a minimum light dose of 1,000 J/cm of esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This dose appears safe </plain></SENT>
