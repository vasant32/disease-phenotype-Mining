<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treatment and follow-up policy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> are dependent on the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, sampling error of random biopsy protocols and subjectivity of pathological grading may hamper endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Amsterdam Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center Barrett Advisory Committee (BAC) is a regional multidisciplinary consultative working-group, offering revision of pathology, revision of pathology plus additional endoscopic diagnostics, or referral for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between July 1998 and July 1999 30 patients were referred to the B.A.C for advice; eighteen patients were referred because of suspicion of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reassessment of biopsies, including additional quantitative pathology, with or without additional endoscopic diagnostics, led to adjustment of the grading of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 15 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A suspicion of low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was rejected in nine out of ten cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjustment of the original diagnosis often influenced further therapy or follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: reassessment of conventional pathology, quantitative pathology, and additional diagnostic procedures might improve the accuracy of diagnosis and staging of malignant degeneration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, although experience is still limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The complexity of the management of these patients demands a specialised multidisciplinary approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A Barrett Advisory Committee can offer valuable contributions to the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
