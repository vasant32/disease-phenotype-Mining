<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) allows real-time detection of neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the accuracy of pCLE in real time has not yet been extensively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of pCLE in addition to high-definition white-light endoscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE alone for the detection of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (EC) in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: International, prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Five tertiary referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 101 consecutive BE patients presenting for surveillance or endoscopic treatment of HGD/EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE, narrow-band imaging (NBI), and pCLE, and the findings were recorded before biopsy samples were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The order of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE and NBI was randomized and performed by 2 independent, blinded endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> suspicious lesions on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE or NBI and 4-quadrant random locations were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These locations were examined by pCLE, and a presumptive diagnosis of benign or neoplastic (HGD/EC) tissue was made in real time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, biopsies were taken from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> locations and were reviewed by a central pathologist, blinded to endoscopic and pCLE data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Diagnostic characteristics of pCLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE were 34.2% and 92.7%, respectively, compared with 68.3% and 87.8%, respectively, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE or pCLE (P = .002 and P &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE or NBI were 45.0% and 88.2%, respectively, compared with 75.8% and 84.2%, respectively, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE, NBI, or pCLE (P = .01 and P = .02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Use of pCLE in conjunction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE and NBI enabled the identification of 2 and 1 additional HGD/EC patients compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE or NBI, respectively, resulting in detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HGD/EC patients, although not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Academic centers with enriched population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: pCLE combined with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE significantly improved the ability to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in BE patients compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This may allow better informed decisions to be made for the management and subsequent treatment of BE patients </plain></SENT>
