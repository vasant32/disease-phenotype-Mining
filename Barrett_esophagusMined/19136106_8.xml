<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The rate of occult <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at esophagectomy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) has been reported to be approximately 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been suggested that this risk may be overestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the rate of submucosal invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients undergoing esophagectomy for BE after biopsy diagnosis of HGD or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A secondary aim was to identify clinical risk factors for submucosal invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with preoperative BE with HGD or IMC treated with esophagectomy over a 20 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Submucosal invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty patients were included (41 with preoperative HGD, 19 with preoperative IMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of submucosal invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was 6.7% (95% CI, 1.8%-16.2%) (n = 4), with a 5% rate of submucosal invasion in patients with preoperative HGD and 11% for patients with preoperative IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 patients with submucosal invasion at esophagectomy had either nodular or ulcerated mucosa on preoperative endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 1-year and 5-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for the entire cohort were 1.9% and 10.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate of submucosal invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at esophagectomy in BE patients with HGD or IMC on biopsy is much lower than 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After adequate sampling and staging, patients with BE with HGD and IMC, especially those without endoscopically visible lesions, can potentially be treated by nonsurgical (local) therapies </plain></SENT>
