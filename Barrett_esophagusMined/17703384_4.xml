<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: In patients with presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> we evaluated clinical risk factors that could predict the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in biopsies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE), independently of histological results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 908 patients with CLE of length &gt; or = 2 cm, data on age, sex, reflux symptoms, tobacco and alcohol use, medication use, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy findings were prospectively collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, and a model for predicting the histological results was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 127/908 patients, biopsies of CLE did not contain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 781 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, 663 patients (85%) had no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 118 (15%) had low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most important predictors for the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were length of CLE, size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and male sex, while among those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, age and male sex were most important for the presence of LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate combinations of these predictors yielded reliable models, which were able to discriminate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> well from no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (area under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve 0.82), but only reasonably discriminated LGD from no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (area under ROC 0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A simple model based on clinical findings can be used to predict the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in biopsies from CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, predicting the presence of LGD versus no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> is more difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Predictions from these models may aid decision making on whether a patient with CLE should have surveillance, in view of the known sampling error at endoscopy and interobserver variability at histology </plain></SENT>
