<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The purpose of our study was to determine late subjective and objective results of these classic surgical techniques in a large number of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 152 patients were included in this prospective protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (0.7%) after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The late follow-up of 100 months demonstrated a high percentage of failures among patients with noncomplicated BE (54%) and an even higher figure in patients with complicated BE (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> appeared at 8 years of follow-up and an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour pH monitoring demonstrated a decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> into the esophagus, and Bilitec studies also demonstrated a decrease of duodenoesophageal reflux, but in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with a higher value than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Classic antireflux surgery in patients with BE results in a high percentage of failures at very late follow-up because it cannot completely avoid acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e> into the esophagus </plain></SENT>
