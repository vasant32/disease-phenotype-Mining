<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may be proposed that the relaxant effect of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> on the smooth muscles may lead to resistance of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure with a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: Sixteen rats were grouped as control and treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After obtaining LES tissues followed by a 60 min equilibration period for stabilization, contractile response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi> was obtained by application of single dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi> to have a final concentration of 10(-6) M in the organ bath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the contractions reached a plateau, concentration-response relationships for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> were obtained in a cumulative manner in the treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi> contracted LES preparations; 1.5 × 10(-6) and 1.5×10(-5) M of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> caused 6.08% and 11.34% relaxations respectively which were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, mean integral relaxation value for 4.5 × 10(-5) M of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> was 17.34% and this relaxation was significant compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: In the present study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> caused no direct significant change in LES tone in the therapeutic dose range applied to the organ bath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> at the high dose caused a significant decrease in the LES tone </plain></SENT>
