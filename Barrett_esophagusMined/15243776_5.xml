<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 1987, we have used an isoperistaltic gastric tube to replace the esophagus in children, and we present a series of 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indications for operation included caustic injury (nine), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> (eight), peptic stricture (two), congenital stricture (one), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100681'>esophageal duplication</z:hpo> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the graft during the early postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The esophagogastric anastomosis leaked in two cases, but both of them closed spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dumping syndrome</z:e> was encountered in two children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients had strictures of their upper anastomosis responding to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two patients who had a pharyngogastric anastomosis developed either intractable stricture or nonfunctioning anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of them died 9 months later from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 16 of 21 patients could accept a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet (13 were entirely asymptomatic, and three suffered occasional mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients suffered significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (one had a durable dilation of his gastric tube), and three needed a feeding jejunostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Acid secretion of the gastric tube was proved in nine cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients were shown to have cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> above the anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the need for lifelong endoscopic follow-up for these patients </plain></SENT>
