<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although long-term survival data exist, little is known about functional outcome and quality of life in this particular subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent esophageal resection for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from June 1991 through July 1997 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Long-term functional outcome and quality of life were assessed using a two-part written survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 54 patients (48 men, 6 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 64 years (range, 36 to 83 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy was performed in 34 patients (63%), transhiatal esophagectomy in 10 (18%), extended esophagectomy in 8 (15%), and other in 2 (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was found in 19 patients (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients (9%) were stage 0, 7 (13%) stage I, 3 (6%) stage IIA, 1 (2%) stage IIB, and 3 patients (6%) stage III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was one operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 31 patients (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median hospitalization was 13 days (range, 11 to 44 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was complete in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and ranged from 6 months to 9 years (median, 63 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall 5-year survival was 86% and did not differ significantly from a population matched for age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival for patients with only high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 96% and 68% for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (p = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was measured by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For patients with only high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the role-physical and role-emotional scores were better than for the control population (p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, the health perception score was worse than for the control population (p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Scores measuring physical-function, social function, mental health, bodily pain, and energy/<z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although perioperative morbidity is significant, surgical resection of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> provides excellent long-term survival with acceptable function and quality of life </plain></SENT>
