<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a well characterized series of 431 individuals enrolled in a case-control study, we studied the frequency of the IGF-IR gene polymorphism, G1013A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On multivariate analysis controlling for age and gender, in comparison to asymptomatic controls, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with the polymorphic A-variant (G/A, A/A) were found to have significantly increased risk for EADC (OR 4.81; 95%CI 1.09-21.15), whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with the G/G variant were not at statistically significant increased risk (OR 2.69; 95%CI 0.41-17.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, compared to asymptomatic controls, only <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with the A-variant (G/A, A/A) were at increased risk for BE (OR 3.11; 95%CI 1.12-8.63), while <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with the G/G variant were not at increased risk for BE (OR 2.91; 95%CI 0.69-12.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that the common IGF-IR gene polymorphism G1013A modulates the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> for EADC, an effect most likely mediated by altered the receptor function by influencing gene transcription or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings further implicate the insulin-like growth factor axis in the molecular pathogenesis of EADC, and represent a plausible mechanistic link underlying the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
