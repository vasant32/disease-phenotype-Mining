<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is based on histologic demonstration of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experience may be important in the endoscopic recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, including in regard to appropriate procurement of biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess factors that may influence accuracy in the diagnosis of short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopy reports pertaining to procedures performed over a 1-year period that included esophageal biopsies because of suspected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Barrett's epithelium involving less than 2 cm of the distal esophagus was considered SSB; greater than 2 cm was considered long-segment (LSB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopists were regarded as "more experienced" if they had completed training more than 5 years earlier and "less experienced" if the time elapsed since the completion of training was less than 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: More and less experienced endoscopists both obtained esophageal biopsy specimens because of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at the same rate (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Length of suspected Barrett's epithelium was not predicted by symptoms or demographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endoscopically, patients with SSB had significantly fewer (64.2% vs. 90.8%) and smaller (2.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 3.5 +/- 0.2 cm) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> compared with those with LSB (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Suspected SSB was histologically confirmed in 38.4% (True SSB), whereas LSB was confirmed in 75% (True SSB) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More experienced endoscopists were significantly more likely to obtain histologic confirmation of SSB than less experienced endoscopists (48.6% vs. 29.5%; p = 0.02, nominal significance from univariate hypothesis testing; correction for multiple testing of data removed significance at the p &lt; 0.05 level; OR = 2.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With greater experience, an endoscopist is more likely to diagnose SSB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may be due to more accurate procurement of adequate tissue samples, which thereby results in a greater yield of histopathologic diagnoses </plain></SENT>
