<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> that is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, clinical investigation aimed at prevention of progression to malignant disease has been hampered by the variable prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to more accurately determine the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> among individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> who would be available for enrollment in a chemoprevention trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The pathology archives of 3 institutions were reviewed over a 5-year period for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reports of diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and duplicate or referral cases were excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 790 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 37 (4.7%) were cases of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), and 20 (2.5%) were cases of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The University of Michigan Medical Center (Ann Arbor, MI) diagnosed 18 cases of LGD, Henry Ford Hospital (Detroit, MI) diagnosed 15 cases of LGD, and Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA) diagnosed 4 cases of LGD in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> over the 5-year study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The confirmed low prevalence of cases of LGD will affect the design of future clinical trials of chemopreventive interventions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
