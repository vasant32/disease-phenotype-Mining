<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the pathophysiology in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is not totally understood and new methods are searched for the assessment of progression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to search the immunohistochemical expression of CDX2, COX2 and MUC2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to detect any early evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: The staining properties were examined in the intestinal metaplastic (goblet cell-containing columnar epithelium), columnar (non-goblet columnar epithelium), distant columnar (non-goblet columnar epithelium distant from intestinal metaplastic epithelium) and squamous epithelium in 59 pathologically diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 22 of which having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared statistically with Pearson and Fisher exact tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of the staining of intestinal metaplastic, non-goblet columnar distant columnar, and squamous epithelium, respectively were as follows: for CDX2 76.3%, 23.7%, 1.7%, 0%; for COX-2 93.2%, 47.5%, 8%, 62.9%; for MUC2 93.2%, 11.9%, 4% and 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of CDX2, COX2 and MUC2 in the intestinal metaplastic epithelium was higher than the expression in distant and non-goblet columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of CDX2, COX2 and MUC2 in the foci of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> decreased significantly (18.2%, 27.3%, 31.9%, and p=0.039, 0.0001, 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>COX2 expression in squamous epithelium was also lower when the adjacent mucosa has <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (p=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CDX2, COX2 and MUC2 expressions were seen in the intestinal epithelium having goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of the markers in the diagnosis is controversial but the difference in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> sequence seems to be meaningful </plain></SENT>
