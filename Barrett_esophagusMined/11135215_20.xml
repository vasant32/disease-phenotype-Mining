<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the gastric cardia has increased recently in the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in Japan, most patients with gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> have disease that is situated in the body and the distal stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to compare the clinicopathologic findings of patients with early gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e>) arising at the cardia and those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in more distal parts of the stomach, then comparing the findings with those from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the gastric cardia in the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three thousand one hundred forty-four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> who underwent surgical resection between 1962 and 1997 at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center Hospital in Tokyo were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> at the cardia were compared with those who had lesions in the middle and lower parts of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The body mass index (BMI), smoking, and drinking were evaluated using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with cardia <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> and 344 patients in a matched cohort in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy patients had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> located just at the cardia, whereas 2796 patients had lesions in the lower two-thirds of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The former lesions were different from those in the distal two-thirds of the stomach: More often, they were of an elevated type (34% vs. 14%, respectively, they were histologically well differentiated in 89% (vs. 59%), and there were more submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (53% vs. 41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BMI, smoking, and drinking in the two groups were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> were 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>9% (2 of 70 patients) and 5.7% (4 of 70 patients), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were many significant differences in clinicopathologic characteristics between patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the cardia and patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the distal stomach in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of early cardia <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was very low in Japan, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, smoking, drinking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were not related to its occurrence, in contrast to reports in the West </plain></SENT>
