<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate differences in the physiopathological findings (manometry and pH monitoring) and symptoms between cases of non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and erosive reflux disease (ERD) found positive at 24 h pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For a total of 670 patients who underwent 24 h pH monitoring, esophageal manometry and upper endoscopy were retrospectively evaluated, assessing the reflux symptoms, manometric characteristics of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and esophageal body and the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Typical and atypical symptoms were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For inclusion in the study, patients had to have NERD or ERD and be found positive on pH monitoring (NERD+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) complicated by stenosis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 214 patients were involved in the study, i.e. 107 cases of NERD+ and 107 of ERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant gender- or age-related differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ERD group had more cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (P = 0.02) and more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, both in terms of number of reflux episodes (P = 0.01) and as a percentage of the total time with a pH &lt; 4 (P = 0.00), when upright (P = 0.007) and supine (P = 0.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The NERD+ cases had more reflux episodes while upright (P = 0.02) and the ERD cases while supine (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The LES pressure was higher in cases of NERD+ (P = 0.03) while the amplitude and duration of their esophageal peristaltic waves tended to be better than in the ERD group (P &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The NERD+ patients presented more often with atypical symptoms (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The NERD+ patients' fewer reflux episodes and the fact that they occurred mainly while in the upright position (unlike the cases of ERD) may be two factors that do not favor the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The frequently atypical symptoms seen in patients with NERD+ need to be accurately evaluated for therapeutic purposes because patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and atypical symptoms generally respond only partially to medical and surgical treatments </plain></SENT>
