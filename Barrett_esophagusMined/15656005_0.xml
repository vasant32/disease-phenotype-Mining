<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is rendered based on proof of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the tubular portion of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Barrett's develops in a percentage of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>; risk factors include a long history of the disease, age over 40 years and Caucasian skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifics about a genetic predisposition have not become known to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each year, around one out of every 200 patients with Barrett's epithelium develop <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus, the incidence of which has risen dramatically over the past two decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apart from the early stages, the prognosis for this type of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is extremely unfavorable, even after esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It therefore appears sensible to examine patients with a long history of reflux and/or frequently recurrent reflux symptoms and to develop screening strategies for timely detection of persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> along with subsequent monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This would involve regular endoscopic studies accompanied by biopsies aimed at excluding or demonstrating the intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> that count as direct precursors to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of nonneoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> can be symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although theoretically logical, the benefits of normalizing esophageal acid exposure have not been proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> or mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> have been confirmed, local endoscopical resection and/or ablation appear sufficient, since the risk of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> is extremely low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Previous studies on this subject have been very promising, but should be continued and/or verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Definitive therapy of more advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stages is currently given according to multimodal concepts established in an interdisciplinary manner </plain></SENT>
