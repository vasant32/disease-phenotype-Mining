<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to determine if there is a correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> length and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> length, and to develop a predictive model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> length by using <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> length and duration of esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosed endoscopically were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was defined by the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in biopsy specimens obtained from salmon-colored mucosa extending into the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Barrett's mucosa 3 cm or greater in length was considered long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; and less than 3 cm long was considered short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was considered present if the esophagogastric junction was displaced 1 cm or more proximal to the diaphragmatic hiatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four men (mean age 66.1 +/-2.4 [SE]) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean Barrett's length was 4.1 +/-0.7 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Pearson correlation coefficient between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> length and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> length was 0.62 (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was a significant correlation between esophageal acid exposure and Barrett's length (r = 0.62; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> length and duration of esophageal acid exposure were associated significantly with length of Barrett's mucosa (R(2) = 0.54; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A regression equation was developed expressing mean Barrett's length (cm) = 0.79 + (0.68) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> length (cm) + (0.075) duration of esophageal acid exposure (% time pH &lt; 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The length of Barrett's mucosa correlated with the length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A predictive model for Barrett's length by using <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> length and duration of esophageal acid exposure was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This suggested that these two pathophysiologic factors are good predictors of the length of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
