<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of endoscopic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) for ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in a prospective randomized controlled trial in two university teaching hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) medication and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were randomized to undergo either ablation using endoscopic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) or ongoing surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients underwent endoscopy at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) versus surveillance endoscopy was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy and histopathological appearances of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at 12 months follow-up was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initially, at least 95% ablation of the metaplastic mucosa was achieved in 25 of the 26 treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, 14 of 23 APC patients had at least 95% regression, and nine of 23 had complete regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No surveillance patient had more than 95% regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> shortened significantly after APC (mean 3.0 vs. 0.5 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> follows ablation with APC, although complete regression was achieved in less than half </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The role of APC ablation of non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
