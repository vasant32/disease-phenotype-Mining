<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we show that acidic pH, like the topoisomerase II (TOP2) poison <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi> (demethylepipodophyllotoxin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29853">ethylidene</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22798">beta-D-glucoside</z:chebi>), induces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene(DMBA)-initiated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following studies in tissue culture models have suggested that acidic pH acts like a TOP2 poison to induce TOP2-mediated DNA damage: (i) acidic pH induces TOP2-dependent DNA damage signals as evidenced by up-regulation of p53 and Ser-139 phosphorylation of H2AX [a substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> mutated (ATM)ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinases]; (ii) acidic pH-induced cytotoxicity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells is reduced in TOP2-deficient cells; (iii) acidic pH increases the mutation frequency of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) gene in a TOP2-dependent manner; and (iv) acidic pH induces reversible TOP2-mediated DNA strand breaks in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We discuss the possibility that TOP2-mediated DNA damage may contribute to acidic pH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
