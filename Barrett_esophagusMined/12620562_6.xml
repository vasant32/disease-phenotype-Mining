<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is thought to be a precursor of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the lower esophagus in the Western world is rising and accounts for more than 40% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not possible to identify which Barrett's patients are at high risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we applied a statistical classification strategy to the analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and histopathological data from esophageal biopsies to ascertain whether this risk could be identified in Barrett's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue specimens from 72 patients (29 noncancer-bearing and 43 cancer-bearing) were analyzed by one-dimensional proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 8.5 Tesla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic correlation was performed between the magnetic resonance spectra and histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The magnetic resonance magnitude spectra were preprocessed, followed by identification of optimal spectral regions, and were then classified by cross-validated linear discriminant analysis of rank orders of the first derivative of magnetic resonance spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with a statistical classification strategy analysis distinguished <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus from <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and Barrett's epithelium with an accuracy of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Barrett's epithelium and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were distinguished with an accuracy of 98.6% but only when 4 of the Barrett's specimens and 7 of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> specimens, determined to be "fuzzy" (ie, unable to be accurately assigned to either class) were withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 7 cancer and 4 Barrett's specimens, determined to be "fuzzy" using the Barrett's versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (B versus C) classifier, were submitted to the other two classifiers (Barrett's versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> [B versus N] and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> [N versus C], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 4 Barrett's specimens were assigned to Barrett's by the N versus B classifier and to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 2) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (n = 2) classes by the N versus C classifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 7 cancer specimens were crisply assigned to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> class (N versus C), or for the B versus N classifier, to the Barrett's class (ie, more similar to Barrett's than to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Visual inspection of the spectra from histologically identified Barrett's epithelium showed a gradation from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of esophageal biopsies combined with a statistical classification strategy data analysis provides a robust diagnosis with a high degree of accuracy for discriminating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Different spectral categories of Barrett's epithelium were identified both by visual inspection and by statistical classification strategy, possibly reflecting the risk of future <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
