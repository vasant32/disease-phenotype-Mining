<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Guidelines for reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> measurements and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> grades have been developed to improve consistency, communication, and, ultimately, patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to assess the percentage of cases in which findings were reported in accordance with guidelines and to assess the impact of education and feedback on reporting behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study design was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chart reviews were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy at a tertiary care center during three 2-month time periods during a 12-month interval: Time 1 (March 1, 2004-April 30, 2004), Time 2 (July 1, 2004-August 31, 2004), and Time 3 (March 1, 2005-April 30, 2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standardized educational sessions began 2 years before Time 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No intervention took place between Time 1 and Time 2; data were collected to examine secular change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between Time 2 and Time 3, individual and group feedback and refresher sessions were given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five thousand six hundred nine eligible esophagogastroduodenoscopies were performed, of which 2675 demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and/or reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At baseline, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> measurements were dictated correctly in a median of 67% and 86% of cases, respectively, improving to 100% (P &lt; .05) and 98% (P &lt; .01) of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Los Angeles Classification system was used in a median of 100% of cases at baseline and at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anonymous individual and group feedback, in combination with brief, structured didactic educational sessions, significantly improves compliance with established guidelines for the reporting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Once successfully incorporated into clinical practice, adherence to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> Los Angeles Classification System is easy to maintain </plain></SENT>
