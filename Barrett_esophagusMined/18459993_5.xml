<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The designated area of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) is anatomically defined by the distal limit of the lower esophageal palisade vessels (LEPV) and the term '<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>' is equally used along with the name CLE in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the actual prevalence of CLE based on the Japanese criteria and to evaluate the criteria per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 42 esophagi consecutively resected at this institute were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent a surgical resection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The position of the LEPV, squamocolumnar junction, the prevalence of CLE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were investigated both pre- and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative endoscopy revealed CLE based on the Japanese criteria in half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the resected specimens the distal limit of LEPV was lower than the squamocolumnar junction in 95.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In other words, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases had CLE (equivalent to Barrett's mucosa in Japanese criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, most of the CLE areas were very short and their average maximum length was only about 5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was observed in any of the CLE cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals might therefore be diagnosed to have CLE or Barrett's mucosa based on precise endoscopic observations in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CLE located in a small area, e.g. less than 5 mm, defined according to the LEPV criteria without any other factor concerning typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> such as signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> should therefore be excluded from consideration as a high-risk mucosa </plain></SENT>
