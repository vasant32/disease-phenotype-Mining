<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath>, the direct precursor to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, is often unapparent and frequently missed during surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with four-quadrant forceps biopsy protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine whether the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is improved by adding computer-assisted brush biopsy (EndoCDxÂ©) to four-quadrant biopsy protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> scheduled for endoscopic surveillance were recruited from four academic medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent brush biopsy followed by four-quadrant biopsy every 1-2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results from brush and forceps biopsy were reviewed independently by pathologists blinded to the other's results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 151 patients enrolled (124 men, 27 women; mean age: 65), 117 (77.5%) had forceps and brush-biopsy specimens adequate for interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean number of forceps biopsies was 11.9 (median 10, range 2-40) and brush biopsies was 2.0 (median 2, range 1-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall yield of forceps alone was 25.2% (n = 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brush biopsy added an additional 16 positive cases increasing the yield of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection by 42% (95% CI: 20.7-72.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number needed to test (NNT) to detect one additional case of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 9.4 (95% CI: 6.4-17.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in results among different centers, between standard versus jumbo forceps, or between forceps biopsies taken every 1 cm versus every 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that computer-assisted brush biopsy is a useful adjunct to standard endoscopic surveillance regimens for the identification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
