<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured proliferative and cell cycle fractions of biopsies from a cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to better understand the role of proliferation in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> and the association between cell cycle dysregulation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cell proliferative fractions (determined by Ki67/DNA multiparameter flow cytometry) and cell cycle fractions (DNA content flow cytometry) were measured in 853 diploid biopsies from 362 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inactivation status of CDKN2A and TP53 was assessed in a subset of these biopsies in a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A prospective study followed 276 of the patients without detectable <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> for an average of 6.3 years with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> as an end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diploid S and 4N (G(2)/tetraploid) fractions were significantly higher in biopsies with TP53 mutation and loss of heterozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CDKN2A inactivation was not associated with higher Ki67-positive, diploid S, G(1), or 4N fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High Ki67-positive and G(1)-phase fractions were not associated with the future development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (P=0.13 and P=0.15, respectively), whereas high diploid S-phase and 4N fractions were (P=0.03 and P&lt;0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High Ki67-positive proliferative fractions were not associated with inactivation of CDKN2A and TP53 or future development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in our cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biallelic inactivation of TP53 was associated with elevated 4N fractions, which have been associated with the future development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
