<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: For patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> limited to the mucosa endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is the therapy of choice whereas surgical resection is advocated for submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study analyzes the histopathologic results of patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> who underwent EMR prior to transthoracic esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> and EMR as first line treatment were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy because of submucosal infiltration combined incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection at the lateral/basal resection margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient each, surgical therapy was indicated due to submucosal infiltration or incomplete resection only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent surgical resection due to residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> within an <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo> following EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical specimens were examined for pT and pN stage according to the UICC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) and 13 patients an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC), nine patients with a long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the pT stages was as follows: 6x pT0 (no histopathologic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e>), 1x pT1m1, 1x pT1m2, 3x pT1m3, 1x pT1sm1, 1x pT1sm2, 1x pT2, and 2x pT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of 16 patients (18.8%) with a pT1sm1, pT2, and pT3 stage had nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients metastatic nodes were located in the mediastinum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In two patients, a second <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was detected during histopathologic work-up (1x AC in the cardia and 1x <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> in the cervical esophagus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data of this highly selected patients indicate that the boundary between the therapy of mucosal and submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is not as clear as stated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, treatment of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> demands a close interdisciplinary cooperation </plain></SENT>
