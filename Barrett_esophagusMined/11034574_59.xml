<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) is a treatment in which cell damage is achieved by the action of light on a photosensitizing agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have assessed the potential use of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in the ablation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty six patients with dysplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> receiving acid suppression medication with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> were randomised to receive oral 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) 30 mg/kg or placebo, followed four hours later by laser endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow up endoscopy was performed at one, six, 12, and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 18 patients in the ALA group, a response was seen in 16 (median decrease in area in the treated region 30%; range 0-60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group, a decrease in area of 10% was observed in two patients with no change in 16 (median 0%; range 0-10%; treatment v placebo, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was seen in the columnar epithelium within the treatment area of any patient in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the placebo group, persistent low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found in 12 patients (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no short or long term major side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effects of treatment were maintained for up to 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomised controlled trial of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It demonstrates that ALA induced <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> can provide safe and effective ablation of low grade dysplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
