<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of upper endoscopy (EGD) in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients prior to bariatric surgery is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic yield and cost of routine EGD before bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of consecutive <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients who underwent EGD prior to bariatric surgery between May 2000 and September 2002 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two experienced endoscopists reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EGD reports, and findings were divided into 4 groups based on predetermined criteria: group 0 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> study), group 1 (abnormal findings that neither changed the surgical approach nor postponed surgery), group 2 (abnormal findings that changed the surgical approach or postponed surgery), and group 3 (results that were an absolute contraindication to surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically important findings included lesions in groups 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cost of EGD (430.72 US dollars) was estimated using the endoscopist fee under Medicare reimbursement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 28-month study period, 195 patients were evaluated by EGD prior to bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One or more lesions were identified in 89.7% of patients, with 61.5% having a clinically important finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of endoscopic findings using the classification system above was as follows: group 0 (10.3%), group 1 (28.2%), group 2 (61.5%), and group 3 (0.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, the most common lesions identified were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (40.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (28.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (9.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcer</z:hpo> (3.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (3.1%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcer</z:mp> (3.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cost of performing routine endoscopy on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients prior to bariatric surgery was 699.92 US dollars per clinically important lesion detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Routine upper endoscopy before bariatric surgery has a high diagnostic yield and has a low cost per clinically important lesion detected </plain></SENT>
