<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Measurements were performed using image cytometry (CAS 200/486) with "at convenience" sampling and stereology (QPRODIT 5.2) with both at convenience and systematic random sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Quantitation of p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) by CAS was very reproducible by the same observer (r = .99), but its interobserver reproducibility was lower, and the measurement was time consuming (r = .81, 35 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CAS also detected a "signal" in the absence of any visually observable brown stain, giving false positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility by QPRODIT 5.2 were good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With QPRODIT, using systematic random sampling, the measurements were more reproducible by different observers and faster (r = .96, 10 minutes) than with QPRODIT with at convenience sampling (r = .91, 20 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, for assessment of the Ki-67 labelling index (LI) and area percentage (area%) of Ki-67-positive nuclei, we used only QPRODIT with systematic random sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While intraobserver reproducibility of both Ki-67 LI and area% was good (r = .96, r = .99), interobserver reproducibility of Ki-67 LI was poorer than area% (r = .72 vs. r = .97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The assessment of Ki-67 LI was time consuming, whereas the measurement of the area% of Ki-67-positive nuclei was very time effective (45 vs. 7 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation was found between Ki-67 LI and area% of Ki-67-positive nuclei (r = .92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Therefore, we conclude that quantitation of p53 and Ki-67 IHC in BE mucosa can be very reproducible and highly time effective by means of stereology with systematic random sampling </plain></SENT>
