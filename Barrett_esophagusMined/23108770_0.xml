<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is increasingly accepted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Description of the etiology, natural history, and prevalence of buried Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BBM) following RFA is limited, although BBM continues to pose a clinical dilemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the prevalence, characteristics, and eradication rate of BBM in patients with both dysplastic and nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, treated with RFA and followed over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and BBM, before and after RFA, was assessed by two gastrointestinal pathologists in a retrospective chart review of patients who had undergone RFA at our center and had completed appropriate follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 112 patients with completed treatment and no further planned RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 108, no residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was seen after RFA; 4 patients with persistent Barrett's tissue underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding BBM, 17/112 patients (15.2%) had evidence of BBM during evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 12/17 (70.5%) BBM was found during the RFA treatment, with 8 having previously undergone non-RFA therapy and RFA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and 4 having no previous intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 5/17 (29.4%), BBM was seen only after RFA monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 17 showed no evidence of BBM at final evaluation and were classified in the complete remission group (108/112) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and BBM were completely eradicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with long-term follow-up after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Almost half of the patients with BBM had a prior history of non-RFA therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> compared with 26% the non-BBM cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with previously identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and BBM were completely cleared of disease at final follow-up </plain></SENT>
