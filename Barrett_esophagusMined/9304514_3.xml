<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a successful tissue culture method employing a serum-free medium for cultivation of Barrett's epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fragments of Barrett's mucosal tissue were explanted in a 3:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium and Ham's F12, to initiate the outgrowth of epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, a commercial serum-free medium (formulated for the growth of keratinocytes) was used for the propagation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> cells without fibroblast growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells established in culture retained their epithelial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, stained positive for cytokeratin, and contained Alcian blue (pH 2.5) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff reagent-positive/diastase-resistant vacuoles, confirming their origin from Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy showed tonofilaments, microvilli and desmosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coating the surface of culture vessels was not required and four cell strains could be passaged up to 20 times with no fibroblast growth, in the keratinocyte serum-free medium </plain></SENT>
