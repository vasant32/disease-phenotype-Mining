<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently a rat esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) model was established in our laboratory by using esophagoduodenal anastomosis (EDA) plus iron supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous study suggested that iron supplementation enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and the production of reactive nitrogen species in the esophageal epithelium, which could contribute to esophageal adenocarcinogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we further characterized oxidative damage in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We were particularly interested in how excess iron was deposited in the esophagus, and which cells were targeted by oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats received iron supplementation (50 mg Fe/kg/month, i.p.) starting 4 weeks after EDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed at 11, 30 or 35 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EAC appeared as early as week 11 after surgery, and increased over time, up to 60% at 35 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> EACs were well-differentiated mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at the squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>Iron deposition</z:mpath> was found at the squamocolumnar junction and in the area with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> could result from transient increase of blood iron after i.p. injection, and the overexpression of transferrin receptor in the premalignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Oxidative damage to DNA (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine), protein (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> content) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substance) in the esophagus was significantly higher than that of the non-operated control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CLE cells were believed to be the target cells of oxidative damage because they overexpressed <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase 1 and metallothionein, both known to be responsive to oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We propose that oxidative damage plays an important role in the formation of EAC in the EDA model, and a similar situation may occur in humans with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and iron over-nutrition </plain></SENT>
