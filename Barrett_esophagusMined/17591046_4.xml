<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in Greece is among the lowest in the world and no clear-cut answer has emerged as to why the incidence of EA is so low in this country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the aim of the study was to provide an explanation for the low incidence of EA in Greece through molecular-based ethnic differentiations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Out of 270 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopic and histologic evaluation due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, 31 patients (23 males, 8 females, mean age 47.10 +/- 11.88 years) with BE (typical salmon-pink lesions) and 21 GERD controls (12 males, 9 females, mean age 46.57 +/- 17.71 years) were ultimately included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal mucosa biopsy specimens were evaluated immunohistochemically for Ki-67, Bax and Bcl-2 expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased expression of Ki-67 was observed in BE patients compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> controls (p = 0.01); increased expression of Bax was noticed in the total BE patients compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> controls (p &lt; 0.001); Bcl-2 expression did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a possible existence of a balance between cell proliferation (indicated by Ki-67 increased expression) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (indicated by Bax protein overexpression), thereby providing an equilibrium between cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell proliferation, and this may partly explain the low EA incidence in Greece </plain></SENT>
