<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have compared endoscopic pinch biopsy (PB) with endoscopically directed Rubin tube suction biopsy (SB) in 40 patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Utilizing a plastic tube attached alongside the endoscope, SB at specific sites in the esophagus can be easily obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Suction biopsy was rated superior to PB for adequacy of tissue, ability to make an interpretation, and certainty in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These differences were most pronounced in patients with endoscopic grades 0 and 1 + <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in which 59% of PBs were uninterpretable compared to 23% of SBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The passage of the Rubin tube was easily done and could be performed repeatedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of 40 patients (15%) developed substernal chest discomfort in the 24 hr following SB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that SB is the most appropriate way to evaluate histologic changes related to reflux injury and that this method is mandatory in symptomatic patients with minimal endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (0-1 +) </plain></SENT>
