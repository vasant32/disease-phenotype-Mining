<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathologic interpretation of biopsy specimens guides endoscopic surveillance as well as the therapeutic approach that will be carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the predictive value of histopathologic diagnosis can be questioned due to its poor intra- and interobserver reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess intra- and interobserver variability in the diagnosis of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three-micrometer thick sections from biopsy specimens from 42 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin and <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-alcian blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reading of the slides was carried out blindly in a light microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intra and interobserver variability in the interpretation of the slides was determined by kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of tissue specimens was 229, with average of 5.45 (1 to 18) fragments for patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was diagnosed by pathologists in 21.4% to 52.4% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intra-observer agreement for the diagnosis of low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was slight (kappa = 0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was poor, with kappa scores between 0.05 and 0.16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, with agreement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathologists examining the same set of slides, was 14.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pathologic interpretation of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> may be subject to marked intra- and interobserver variabiliaty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, as high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, should also be considered for review by two or more pathologists </plain></SENT>
