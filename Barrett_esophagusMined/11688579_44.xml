<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients with CLE measuring 2-16 cm long had 5-37 biopsies per patient that showed CM, OCM, or IM for a total of 424 biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed mapping of the distribution of epithelial types within the CLE showed a distinct zonation of epithelial types; CM was present throughout the CLE, whereas OCM and IM tended to occur in the distal and proximal part of the CLE, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 32 patients (64 of 68 biopsies) showed IM at the most proximal level, compared with 22 of 32 patients (40 of 102 biopsies) in the most distal level biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The density of goblet cells was highest in the most proximal level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differences in prevalence and density of goblet cells between most proximal and most distal level biopsies were highly significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that for a given number of biopsies within the CLE, the likelihood of finding IM is greatest when the biopsies are concentrated in the most proximal area of the CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that glandular transformation of squamous epithelium results in CM. which evolves into OCM and IM by development of specialized parietal cells and goblet cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The severity and nature of reflux cause these epithelial transformations in a constant and predictable manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recognition of these changes permits the development of morphologic definitions of reflux disease and the characterization of the sequence of epithelial changes that represent the reflux-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
