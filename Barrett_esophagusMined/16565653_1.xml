<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnifying chromoendoscopy with alcoholic <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> might allow directed biopsies to improve detection of IM and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients were studied with magnifying chromoendoscopy (Optical power zoom x 115, alcoholic <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy biopsies were performed on one or several zones of BE chosen randomly, for which the chromoendoscopic pattern was determined according to Guelrud's classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among seventy-two biopsies, the agreement between magnifying chromoendoscopy and histology and the positive predictive value of the association of patterns III and IV for the diagnosis of IM were 72.4%; sensibility and specificity were respectively 95.5% and 42.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy was 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the six biopsies that showed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, three were suspected because of two particular patterns: local loss of ridged cerebriform pattern due to the disorganization of the mucosal folds and hypervascularization of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Magnifying chromoendoscopy with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> allows targeted biopsies of the IM in BE and may help to detect high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
