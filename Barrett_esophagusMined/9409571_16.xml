<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To obtain biochemical evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is the precursor of most <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (Adc) of the esophagus and cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Based on morphologic data, BE was previously proposed as the precursor of most Adc of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis would receive strong support if biochemical evidence were found to demonstrate a pattern common to BE and Adc of the esophagus and cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the presence of intestinal-type proteins sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and crypt Cell Antigen (CCAg) in BE, Barrett's Adc, and esophageal-cardial Adc without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each case specimens were collected from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, stomach, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and BE mucosa when present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To study related conditions, five specimens of peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An indirect immunofluorescence technique was employed and sections were analyzed with laser confocal microscopy imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most Barrett's mucosa specimens stained positively for SI (93%) and CCAg (89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These proteins were detected in BE independently of the type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, the coexistence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, or the presence of associated Adc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SI and CCAg were present in 25 (96%) and 24 (92%) of the cases of Adc respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No statistical difference was detected in SI and CCAg expression between Adc samples with and without BE, between BE and Adc samples with or without BE, and between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> located in the esophagus versus the cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No staining for these proteins was detected in stomach or esophageal mucosa, in submucosal glands of the esophagus, in peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data show that BE and Adc of the esophagus and cardia have a similar phenotype and support the hypothesis that most of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> probably originate from preexisting BE </plain></SENT>
