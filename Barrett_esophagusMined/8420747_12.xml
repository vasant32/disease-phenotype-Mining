<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even in the duodenum, the organism was detected in islands of metaplastic gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HP has also been found in <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 15-50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine: (1) the frequency with which HP is found on histopathological sections of heterotopic gastric mucosa (HGM) patch(es) at the upper esophagus, as compared to that of the stomach proper, and (2) the histopathological significance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the HGM patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From 63 patients with HGM patches at the upper esophagus, 48 patients were found to have concurrent adequate specimen from the stomach for modified Steiner's stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 22 patients (45.8%), pair sections from HGM and stomach were negative for HP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 26 patients (54.1%) HP-positive on sections from the antrum and/or body (both in 21 cases) nine patients (18.7%) demonstrated HP in the HGM patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory changes on the H&amp;E section of HGM was present in six patients, HP was detected in HGM only in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory cell infiltration was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine HP-positive HGM patches and in 37 of 39 HP-negative patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory cell infiltration was found in five of these 37 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that HP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of HGM patches at the upper esophagus is part of the HP <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> and an independent colonization of HGM patches without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112734" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric infection</z:e> does not occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
