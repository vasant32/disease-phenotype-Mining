<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is imprecise and controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) allows a detailed circumferential image of the esophageal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective in this study was to assess the utility of EUS for surveillance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with proven BE undergoing endoscopy were evaluated with EUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal wall thickness (EWT) was measured as the distance from the balloon-mucosal interface to the outermost hyperechoic line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EWT was determined as the average of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measurements done every 2-3 cm along the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Identical measurements were performed in a series of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients with BE and 13 control patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had focal submucosal thickening on EUS with EWTs of 10 mm and 7 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection of the esophagus in these two cases with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> revealed submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at the area of EUS-documented thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean EWT of controls measured 2.6 mm, nondysplastic BE measured 3.3 mm, and BE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> measured 4.0 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The EWT of both dysplastic and nondysplastic Barrett's was significantly greater than that of the controls (p &lt; 0.02, Student's t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1) As measured by EUS, the esophageal wall is significantly thickened in the columnar-lined portion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>2) EUS-detected focal thickening may represent submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and guide early surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, EUS may play a role in evaluating the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
