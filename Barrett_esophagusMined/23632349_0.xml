<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no consensus on whether to routinely perform esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) before endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, practice patterns are variable and prospective data are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM:: To determine the proportion of clinically meaningful lesions detected when EGD is performed routinely before EUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY:: This was a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted at tertiary referral center and large community practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing EUS for pancreatico-biliary and mediastinal indications were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOMES:: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful lesion found on EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was a combined outcome defined as any lesion that would alter medical management, or impact the subsequent EUS examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Two hundred four patients were included in the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinically meaningful lesions were found on EGD in 45 patients [22.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 16.4-27.8] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lesions that altered medical management were found in 32 patients (15.7%; 95% CI, 10.7-20.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lesions impacting the subsequent EUS examination were found in 20 patients (9.8%; 95% CI, 5.7-13.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinically meaningful lesions found were (number of patients): <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (14), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> (9), ring/stricture (7), large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (6), hyperplastic gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> (5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (3), surgically altered <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> (2), neoplastic lesion (2), subepithelial mass/<z:hpo ids='HP_0100723'>GIST</z:hpo> (1), stenosis (1), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_68'>diverticulum</z:mpath> (1), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: EGD before EUS may detect enough clinically meaningful lesions to support the routine performance of EGD before EUS </plain></SENT>
