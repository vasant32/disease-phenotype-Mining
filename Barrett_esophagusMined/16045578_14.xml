<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This so-called 'slipped' Nissen fundoplication may be the result of inadequate closure of the diaphragmatic crura or rupture of the sutures or disruption of the muscle fibers approached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From January 2000 to December 2002, a total of seven patients (four male) with a mean age of 56 years (range 22-72 years), were considered for laparoscopic antireflux procedure using DACRON mash to reinforce the crural hiatal closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were operated under general anesthesia; laparoscopy was performed by classical approach with five trocars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean operative time was 120 minutes (range 40-240 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average of postoperative hospital stay was 3.5 days (range, 3-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activities usually on postoperative day 10 (range, 7-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The follow-up time was at least 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was only one late complication related to the use of DACRON mesh at the hiatus, due to migration of the mesh into the esophageal lumen causing disphagia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion the mesh repair antireflux surgery is a good alternative for closing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000775'>diaphragmatic defect</z:hpo> in large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> or to correct this problem in case of recurrence or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
