<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Acid plays a significant role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms, such as heartburn and regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally assumed that acid suppressive therapy improves or eliminates symptoms by normalizing intraesophageal pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this article was to assess the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) in normalizing intraesophageal and intragastric pH in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) rendered symptom free by therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were evaluated by dual-sensor 24-h pH monitoring while receiving <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy for complete control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of intraesophageal and intragastric pH profiles were then made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty patients, 39 men and 11 women, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, without BE, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> tolerated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> well and were asymptomatic at the time of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of patients had abnormal intraesophageal pH profiles despite adequate symptom control on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>, which was associated with significant breakthrough of intraesophageal acid control in both the upright and supine positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low intragastric pH correlated highly with intraesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> only in patients with persistent abnormal esophageal acid exposure (p= 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fifty percent of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> without BE continue to exhibit pathologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and low intragastric pH despite <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy that achieves complete reflux symptom control </plain></SENT>
