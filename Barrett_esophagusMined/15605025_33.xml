<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the endoscopic and the histologic effects of a balloon-based bipolar radiofrequency electrode for ablation of porcine and human esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were performed with a balloon-based, bipolar radiofrequency system that creates a circumferential, thin-layer epithelial ablation zone within the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Phase I, multiple ablations were created in 10 farm swine, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> euthanasia and histologic assessment for completeness of epithelial removal and ablation depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Phase II, multiple ablations were created in 19 farm swine, with varying power and energy density, followed by endoscopy at 2 and 4 weeks to assess stricture formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Phase III, 3 ablations were created in 12 farm swine, with varying energy density (5, 8, 10, 12, 15, or 20 J/cm 2 ) at 350 W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were euthanized at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination determined the percentage of epithelium removed and the ablation depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Phase IV, 3 patients underwent esophageal epithelial ablation before esophagectomy, creating separate lesions proximal to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Completeness of epithelial ablation and ablation depth was quantified histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Phase I, complete removal of esophageal epithelium was achieved at energy density settings of 9.7 to 29.5 J/cm 2  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Phase II, 9.7 and 10.6 J/cm 2 produced no stricture, whereas more than 20 J/cm 2 produced a stricture in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In Phase III, 8-20 J/cm 2 resulted in 100% epithelial ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five and 8 J/cm 2 spared the muscularis mucosae, whereas 10 J/cm 2 caused injury to the muscularis mucosae but preserved the submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In Phase IV, histologic examination demonstrated full-thickness epithelial removal in areas of electrode contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ablation extended only to the muscularis mucosae, without injury to submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the porcine and the human esophagus, circumferential, full-thickness ablation of epithelium without direct injury to the submucosa is possible and was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, depth of ablation was linearly related to energy density of treatment </plain></SENT>
