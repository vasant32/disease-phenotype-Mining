<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Caudal-related homeobox 2 (CDX2) is a transcription factor recently implicated in early differentiation and maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal epithelium and is suggested to play a key role in the pathogenesis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of primary and secondary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> on CDX2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in human esophageal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human esophageal cells: (1) squamous, immortalized by SV40 (Het-1A); (2) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (SEG-1); and (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (HKESC-1 &amp; HKESC-2), were exposed in cell culture for 1-24 h to 100-1,000 microM deoxycholic, chenodeoxycholic, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17687">glycocholic acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> treatment and reverse transcribed to cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CDX2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was determined by both quantitative real-time and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CDX2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was absent before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> exposure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CDX2 expression increased in a dose- and time-dependent fashion with deoxycholic and chenodeoxycholic, but not glycocholic, acid in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximal induction of CDX2 expression was seen in SEG-1 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression in Het-1A cells also increased significantly as did expression in HKESC-1,2 cells, although to a lesser extent than in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that secondary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> stimulation upregulates CDX2 gene expression in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They further support the role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and link the clinical evidence of a high prevalence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> in Barrett's to expression of the gene thought to be responsible for the phenotypic expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
