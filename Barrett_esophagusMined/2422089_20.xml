<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one biopsy specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> from 15 patients and 31 control specimens of the stomach and intestines from 9 patients were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three distinct surface cell types, in addition to the goblet cell, were recognized in Barrett's epithelium: the gastric-like cell in 31% of specimens, which was similar to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric surface cell by quantitative scanning electron microscopy; the intestinal-like cell in 41%, which was most similar to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> small intestinal surface cell; and the variant cell in 80%, which had a range of surface features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By light microscopy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens with variant and intestinal-like cells were classified as specialized columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surface mucous cells in Barrett's epithelium displayed a variety of mucin staining patterns with acid nonsulfated (small intestinal-like) mucin present in 90% of specimens and acid sulfated (colonic-like) mucin in 43% of specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative scanning electron microscopy and mucin histochemical stains reveal a striking cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> not apparent by routine light microscopy </plain></SENT>
