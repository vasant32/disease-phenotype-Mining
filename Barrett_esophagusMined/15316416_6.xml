<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the incidence rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (ACE) in a stable population of 28,000 institutionalized intellectually disabled individuals (IDI) in whom the prevalence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) was previously estimated in a representative sample by 24 h pH monitoring and endoscopy, and in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of ACE were ascertained over a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These IDI do not smoke or drink alcohol and are known to have exceptionally high prevalence rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux disease</z:e>, and consequently of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population comprising 52,038 person-years was observed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of ACE were ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the representative sample, the percentage of this population with BE was estimated to be 10.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ACE incidence rates could then be estimated and compared with those found in a free-living BE cohort after correction for age and gender differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In IDI an incidence rate of ACE of 2.5/1000 person-years was found against 6.3/1000 person-years in the free-living BE cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the age distributions of the IDI and of the free-living BE cohort were very different, and after correction for this factor there was no significantly lower incidence rate of ACE in the IDI (relative risk, 0.79; P = 0.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported incidence study of ACE in a stable, well-defined population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, our findings suggest only a minor role for smoking and alcohol in the etiology of ACE </plain></SENT>
