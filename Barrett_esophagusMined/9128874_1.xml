<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to investigate whether medical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> aimed at suppression of gastric acid production can prevent the development of complications, such as Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or poor esophageal body motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 138 GERD patients were analyzed regarding the development of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or poor esophageal body motility, despite intermittent or continuous treatment with H2 blockers or <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The rate of patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or poor esophageal body motility with or without effective medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was found in 33.8% of patients receiving medical treatment, although it was not present when treatment was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This rate was 21.9% among patients who were not receiving therapy (not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 41.9% of patients with medication had impaired esophageal body motility compared with 59.3% of patients not receiving treatment (P &lt; 0.05), but these patients had a significantly shorter history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Medical treatment with H2 blockers or <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> does not prevent the development of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or poor esophageal body motility </plain></SENT>
