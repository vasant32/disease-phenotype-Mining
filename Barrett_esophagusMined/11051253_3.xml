<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously identified thirteen common minimally deleted regions (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRs</z:e>) on chromosome 17 in twelve Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BOA) specimens using 41 precisely mapped microsatellite markers (Dunn et al., Oncogene, 17: 987-993, 1999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study has been to identify the earliest sites of loss on this chromosome that arise and persist during the progression to BOA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has been undertaken by the analysis of multiple carefully microdissected tissue samples from each of five esophagectomy specimens, several of which contained identifiable premalignant tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate a stepwise accumulation of loss in each analyzed specimen, consistent with a single clonal pathway in four specimens and several coexisting pathways in one specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several clonal anomalies (loss preceding heterozygosity and variable intrasample degrees of loss at different markers) were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within extensively deleted regions of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (seen in three specimens), small deletions were detected in premalignant tissue, predominantly at the site of our identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRs</z:e>, and these losses were seen to expand and merge during the progression to BOA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonal losses at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRs</z:e> were first detected in tissue showing early changes histologically, including Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and intermediate-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results provide further support for many of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRs</z:e> we have previously identified, thereby adding to evidence for the existence of multiple novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated genes on chromosome 17 involved in the development of BOA </plain></SENT>
