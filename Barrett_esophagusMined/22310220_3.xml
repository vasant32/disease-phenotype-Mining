<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The epidemiology of eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EoE) is rapidly evolving, and differences in climate could impact the prevalence of EoE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine the association between esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and climate zones in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of esophageal biopsies from 2008 to 2010 in a large US pathology database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were patients with esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>; controls had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A KÃ¶ppen-Geiger (K-G) climate class was assigned to each patient, and the association between case-control status and the main K-G climate type (tropical, arid, temperate, or cold) was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 233,649 patients were included, 71,948 (30.8%) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal biopsies and 9,995 (4.3%) with esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the temperate zone as the referent and after multivariable analysis, the odds of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> were highest in the cold climate zone (odds ratio (OR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34-1.47), compared with the tropical zone (OR=0.87; 95% CI: 0.71-10.8) and the arid zone (OR=1.27; 95% CI: 1.19-1.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased likelihood of EoE was also associated with increasing odds of being in the cold climate zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal biopsies, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, a clinical suspicion of EoE, no reflux or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, and eosinophilic microabscesses had the highest adjusted odds of being in a cold climate zone (OR 2.02; 1.78-2.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> differs significantly between K-G climate zones, with the highest prevalence in the cold and arid zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Geographical and climate patterns may help identify candidate antigens characteristic to high-prevalence areas to be targeted for future investigation </plain></SENT>
