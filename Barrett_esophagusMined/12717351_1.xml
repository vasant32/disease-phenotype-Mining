<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is a current opinion among surgeons that the esophagus is shorter in patients with reflux disease and particularly in those with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, objective evidence of this is scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we attempted to determine the occurrence and magnitude of this phenomenon among our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred ninety control subjects, 77 patients with severe erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 74 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and 29 with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, stenosis) were grouped according to height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The length of the esophagus was determined by standard manometric study, measuring the distance from the crycopharingeal sphincter to the distal limit of the lower esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Values were expressed in cm as the mean +/- SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The esophageal length according to height was 1 to 2 cm shorter in patients compared to controls, but these differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No differences were found between patients with progressive severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that the presence of a so-called "short esophagus" does not exist or is not relevant in our patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, including those with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
