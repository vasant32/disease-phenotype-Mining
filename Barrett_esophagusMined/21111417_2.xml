<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has been advocated as a method to eliminate the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To provide longer follow-up and determine safety and efficacy of multipolar ablation for nondysplastic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Gastroenterology Unit at the Policlinica Metropolitana, a tertiary care center in Caracas, Venezuela </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred sixty-six patients with nondysplastic BE and histologic evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Patients underwent multipolar electrocoagulation ablation therapy to areas of BE identified with magnification chromoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The identified areas were treated with a 50-W energy source and a 7F "gold" probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After complete ablation, patients were followed on an annual basis with magnification chromoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At annual visits, biopsy specimens were taken in areas identified at baseline as BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Targeted biopsy specimens were taken in areas of recurrent BE identified by using magnification chromoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Mortality, incidence of recurrent BE, incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in ablated BE, and morbidity associated with multipolar electrocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred sixty-six patients were recruited for the study; 139 completed at least 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complications developed in less than 5% of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were minor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recurrent BE occurred in less than 5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus developed in any of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: Uncontrolled clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up of ablation of BE with multipolar electrocoagulation ablation therapy indicates that this is a safe, effective method to ablate BE over the long term </plain></SENT>
