<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Effective esophageal peristalsis is a major determinant of esophageal clearance function and may contribute to the development of complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using 24-hour ambulatory esophageal manometry, we compared the circadian esophageal motor activity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers to that of patients with increased esophageal exposure to gastric juice and various grades of mucosal injury (no mucosal injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, stricture, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter, esophageal acid exposure time, and the frequency of nonperistaltic esophageal contractions during the supine, upright, and meal periods increased with increasing severity of mucosal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median amplitude of esophageal contractions was compromised only in patients with a mechanically defective sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was particularly so in patients with stricture or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and was associated with an increased frequency of ineffective contractions (less than 30 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data show that esophageal motor function deteriorates with increasing severity of mucosal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This appears to be caused by persistent reflux of gastric juice across a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The need for surgical correction of a mechanically defective sphincter before the loss of esophageal body function is implicated </plain></SENT>
