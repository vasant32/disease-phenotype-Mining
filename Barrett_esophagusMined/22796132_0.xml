<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial to assess the effects of the combination of aspirin (3 different doses) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> on tissue concentrations of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG) E(2) in patients with BE with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were recruited through the multicenter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Prevention Network and randomly assigned to groups that were given 40 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> twice daily in combination with an aspirin placebo once daily (arm A; n = 30), with 81 mg aspirin once daily (arm B; n = 47), or with 325 mg aspirin once daily (arm C; n = 45) for 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We collected esophageal biopsy specimens before and after the intervention period to determine the absolute change in mean concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) (the primary end point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on data from 114 patients, baseline characteristics were similar among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absolute mean tissue concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) was reduced by 67.6 ± 229.68 pg/mL in arm A, 123.9 ± 284.0 pg/mL in arm B (P = .10 vs arm A), and 174.9 ± 263.62 pg/mL in arm C (P = .02 vs arm A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi>, short-term administration of higher doses of aspirin, but not lower doses or no aspirin, significantly reduced tissue concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) in patients with BE with either no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support further evaluation of higher doses of aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> to prevent esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in these patients </plain></SENT>
