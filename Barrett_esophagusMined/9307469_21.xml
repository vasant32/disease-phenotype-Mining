<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: From 1972 to 1996, bowel interposition reconstruction after esophagectomy for benign and malignant conditions was performed in 129 of 131 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The indication for operation was benign disease in 94 patients (72.9%) and malignant disease in 35 patients (27.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Benign stricture was the most common presentation in the benign group (41 patients), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was the most common indication in the malignant group (19 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred thirty-three conduits were performed in the 129 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients (3.1%) required reoperative reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 97 conduits employed for reconstruction of benign disease, the right colon was used in 70 patients, the left colon in 9 patients, and the transverse colon in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A jejunal interposition graft was employed in 11 patients and a free jejunal autograft in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The right colon was used in 15 patients with malignant disease, the left colon in 9 patients, and the jejunum in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the population was 54.5 years (range, 14 to 72 years) with a male-to-female ratio of 1.3:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average number of prior thoracic or abdominal procedures was 2.9 (range, 1 to 8) with 50.9% of patients undergoing reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean length of stay was 21.7 days (range, 8 to 290 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 37.1% of patients with anastomotic leak occurring in 14.8% and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in 3.0% of conduits performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The in-hospital mortality was 5.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bowel interposition reconstruction after esophagectomy for benign and malignant disease can be performed with an acceptable morbidity and mortality, despite prior operative procedures in the abdomen or chest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Colonic and jejunal conduits, employed alone or in combination, can effectively restore gastrointestinal continuity </plain></SENT>
