<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In summary we evaluated a 39-year-old man two years after partial esophagectomy and gastroesophageal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had developed recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and atypical reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found free reflux and no antireflux barrier at the hiatus or the esophagogastric anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three different reflux techniques performed simultaneously demonstrated that the composition of refluxant varied with posture, explaining the atypical nature of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the left recumbent posture, the refluxate was comprised of acidified liquid and gaseous gastric contents with the patient complaining of heartburn and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the right recumbent posture the refluxate was composed of only nonacidic gas, and the patient complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> without heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that multiple reflux tests performed simultaneously in the setting where a patient experiences his atypical symptoms may help clarify their origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this case illustrates how posture may dramatically influence refluxant composition </plain></SENT>
