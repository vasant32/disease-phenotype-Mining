<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: For surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> random stepwise four-quadrant biopsy (4QB) is recommended for detecting macroscopically occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thorough performance of the systematic protocol is commonly hampered by poor visibility due to oozing from biopsy sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Topical application of dilute <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> may prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> by vasoconstriction of superficial microvessels and might therefore enable "dry biopsy" sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the safety and efficacy of spraying dilute <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> for optimal 4QB mapping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, double-blind trial 40 patients with known long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were randomly allocated to undergo spraying with either dilute <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> (1 : 20 000) (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> group; n = 20) or saline (control group; n = 20) before 4QB sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During endoscopies patients received continuous monitoring of vital parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopists blinded to randomization assessed visibility scores during biopsy sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, electronically stored images of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> segment after 4QB sampling were evaluated by blinded assessors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean length of Barrett's segments was 5.5 +/- 1.8 cm and the mean number of 4QBs was 12.5 +/- 3.6 with no statistically significant differences between control and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">Epinephrine</z:chebi> spraying did not affect patients' vital parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Visualization ratings by endoscopists on site and by the assessors of the stored images were significantly better in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> spraying reduced the time for 4QB sampling (P = 0.015) and the mean number of saline flushes needed to maintain visibility (P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The novel "dry biopsy" technique with spraying of dilute <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> is safe, and facilitates thorough performance of systematic 4QB mapping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> by improvement of visibility </plain></SENT>
