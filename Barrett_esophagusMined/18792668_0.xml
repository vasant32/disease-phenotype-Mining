<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the frequency of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cases (EA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) cases in two study periods (1977-1988 vs. 1989-2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of gastroesophageal junction (AGEJ) referred to the Nation al Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition "Salvador Zubir√°n" during 1989-2006 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of EA, <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> was compared with the previously reported series of our institute during 1977-1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> and AGEJ were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1989 to 2006 82 patients were studied, 23 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>, 29 with EA and 29 with AGEJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) and EA (OR = 9.5; CI 95% 1.9-48.5, P = 0.0025), and also between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and AGEJ (OR 5.6; CI 95% 1.07-28.8, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and EA (OR 14; CI 95% 1.65-119.2, P = 0.0035) and for GEJC (RM 13.6; IC 95% 1.6-116, P = 0.004) was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was an increase in the frequency of AE from 11% (6/57) in the first period to 56% (29/52) in the second period (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rela tion <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>/EA change from 7:1 in the first period to 0.8:1 in the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There has been an increase in EA, being now the predominant hystologic type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
