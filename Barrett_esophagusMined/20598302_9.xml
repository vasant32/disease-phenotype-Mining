<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), endoscopic biopsy samples are obtained to assess response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether these biopsies are of adequate depth to assess efficacy is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the depth of endoscopic biopsy samples after RFA with those of untreated controls and to determine the prevalence of subepithelial structures in endoscopic biopsy fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the AIM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> Trial, a multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Nineteen treatment centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Subjects with dysplastic BE, either status post RFA or ablation na√Øve (sham) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The proportion of biopsy samples demonstrating subepithelial structures, stratified by tissue type (columnar vs squamous) in sham- and RFA-treated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 5648 biopsy fragments were analyzed from 113 subjects (78 RFA, 35 sham; mean 50.0 fragments per subject) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most fragments (4653, 82.4%) contained subepithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Squamous biopsy samples from RFA and sham subjects demonstrated subepithelium at similar rates (78.4% vs 79.1%, respectively, P = not significant [NS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Columnar biopsy samples from RFA and sham subjects also included subepithelium at similar rates (99.0% vs 98.8%, respectively, P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regardless of treatment assignment, more columnar than squamous biopsy samples demonstrated subepithelium (98.8% vs 78.5%, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Biopsy samples were not individually mounted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In both squamous and columnar tissue, endoscopic biopsy samples after RFA were as likely to demonstrate subepithelium as untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Almost 80% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy samples were adequate to evaluate for subsquamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The primary determinant of biopsy depth is the type of epithelium that underwent biopsy, with squamous less likely to yield subepithelium than columnar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples after RFA appear to be of adequate depth to assess response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>(Clinical trial registration number NCT00282672.) </plain></SENT>
