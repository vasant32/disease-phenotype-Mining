<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major risk factor for BE is <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Screening patients with longstanding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> for BE with upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has become the standard practice, and guidelines from national gastrointestinal (GI) societies recommend only a single screening EGD because of limited evidence, suggesting that BE develops early in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that BE may be present in patients in whom initial endoscopy was negative, either due to a missed diagnosis or due to the later development of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: The purpose of the study was to determine how often BE is identified on repeat endoscopy performed after an initial negative examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative (CORI) National Endoscopic Database was searched for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had more than one EGD during the 5-yr period between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who had either procedure for an indication of surveillance of BE were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was a finding of newly suspected BE on repeat examination after an initial negative examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 24,406 patients underwent more than one endoscopy during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five hundred sixty-one (2.3%) were found to have suspected BE on repeat EGD following an initial negative examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More men than women had BE on repeat examination (3.1%vs 1.2%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BE on repeat examination was more common in patients with reflux as an indication for endoscopy than in patients with any other indication (5%vs 1.6%, P&lt; or =0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In reflux patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> on initial examination, 9.9% were found to have suspected BE on repeat examination versus 1.8% of reflux patients with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> on initial examination (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BE is rarely found on second endoscopy performed less than 5 yr after an initial negative examination except in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> on the first endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Repeat EGD for Barrett's screening should not be performed out of concern for a missed diagnosis except when BE may have been obscured by overlying <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
