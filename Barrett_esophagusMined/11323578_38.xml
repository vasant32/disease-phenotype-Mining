<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a metaplastic change in the esophageal lining with an increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple endoscopic techniques have been applied in an effort to reverse Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a multicenter trial defining the efficacy and safety of multipolar electrocoagulation combined with high-dose acid inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with a 2- to 6-cm segment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were enrolled at 3 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were treated with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg twice daily and then with up to 6 sessions with electrocoagulation aimed at eliminating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the endoscopically apparent Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four quadrant large-capacity biopsies every 2 cm were centrally assessed for residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients reached the endpoint of failure of visual reversal of Barrett's after 6 treatment sessions or a 6-month follow-up after the last session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five percent had visual reversal and 78% both visual and histologic reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients had histologic evidence of residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transient esophageal symptoms were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a stricture requiring dilation and one required overnight hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with 2 to 6 cm of nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> can be safely reversed with this combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up will be necessary to document the durability of the new squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
