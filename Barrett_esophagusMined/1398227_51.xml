<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients who had undergone resection for oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 15 who had undergone oesophagectomy or biopsy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter patients also had adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa biopsied for comparison with the metaplastic oesophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mucosal samples were snap frozen and subsequently stained with monoclonal antibodies to the following oncogene associated proteins; c-erbB2 (neu and CE-1) (external domain), c-erbB2 (NCL-CB11) (internal domain), c-src, c-ras, c-myc, c-fos, c-jun, and the onco-suppressor gene--p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were well or moderately differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arising from the lower third of the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven specimens showed strong membraneous staining with both c-erbB2 (neu) and c-erbB2 (CBL-CB11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven specimens showed strong nuclear staining with p53 onco-suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three specimens were positive for c-ras and c-src, and two were positive for c-jun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's epithelium, nine specimens were positive for c-erbB2 (neu and CB11), three were positive for c-src, two were positive for c-ras and c-jun, and one was positive for c-fos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of the gastric mucosal biopsy specimens expressed c-erbB2 weakly but no other oncogenes were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of positive staining for c-erbB2 is very high, compared with the expression of these genes in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is also concluded that errors in the onco-suppressor gene p53, and especially in the external and internal domains of c-erbB2, which is also often expressed in Barrett's mucosa, may be implicated in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
