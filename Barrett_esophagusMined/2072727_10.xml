<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since 1985, 57 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and gastroesophageal (GE) junction have undergone surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this group, 16 of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> arose in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a significant predilection toward white men above the age of 55 (15/16; 94%) in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean proximal extent of abnormal columnar involvement was 5.4 cm above the gastroesophageal junction (range 2.5 to 11 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> centered in the distal esophagus 1.8 +/- 0.5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the same time period, 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were seen without associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences in the proximal extent of columnar involvement or the presence of reflux symptoms between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in age, smoking history, and alcohol consumption between patients with benign or malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> as compared to those with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the gastroesophageal junction not associated with Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The marked male predominance seen in the group with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was in contrast to the benign cases (16/30; 53%) but was similar to the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> group, without recognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (38/41; 93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in the latter was 0.9 +/- 1.2 cm above the gastroesophageal junction and was comparable to the location in the group with Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 4-year survival rate of patients in the non-Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> group is approximately 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of those with Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the present 4-year survival rate is 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The demographic and morphometric similarities between the Barrett's and non-Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> groups may be of primary importance in determining the true clinical prevalence of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the sensitivity of endoscopic surveillance may be improved if biopsy specimens are concentrated within the distal 3 cm of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, the reason for the current difference in survival between the Barrett's and non-Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> groups is uncertain but may be related to endoscopic surveillance permitting earlier diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
