<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>Cysts</z:mpath> in the metaplastic glands of the Barrett mucosa were present in areas with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 31 of the 32 specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> index (i.e. the number of glandular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> divided by the length-in mm-of mucosa analyzed) was 2.3 in the non-dysplastic Barrett mucosa, and 2.5 in the Barrett mucosa with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly lower indices (p less than 0.001) were found in areas with metaplastic glands covered by "healing" squamous epithelium (0.47) and in the gastric mucosa of the same patients (0.15) as well as in 10 control esophagi underneath <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium (0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outlet of the dilated glands was often obstructed by clusters of dysplastic cells or papillary formations with atypical cells, substantiating on obstructive-causal mechanism in these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were partially or totally replaced by dysplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present findings may be of importance for the histological differential diagnosis between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and highly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in biopsy specimens from the Barrett Mucosa </plain></SENT>
