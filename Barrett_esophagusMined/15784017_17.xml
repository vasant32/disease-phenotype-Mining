<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of ACE is therefore restricted to this BE subpopulation, whose size is unknown and which is for 95% unidentified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the age- and gender-specific incidence rates of ACE, limited to the BE subpopulation, within a defined geographical area and to compare them with those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the esophagus (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>), which can affect the entire population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The age- and gender-specific incidence rates for ACE and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the cardia (AGC) were calculated after an expert panel classified 87% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus reported to the Danish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry over a 6-yr period as ACE or AGC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-specific incidence rates of ACE for males rose from 0.09/10(5) (30-34 yr) to 14.14/10(5) (80-84 yr), falling to 7.2/10(5) (85+ yr), for females from 0.19/10(5) (45-49 yr) to 2.79/10(5) (80-84 yr), falling to 2.43/10(5) (85+ yr) and yielding a gender ratio of 5.9:1; AGC demonstrated a similar pattern and a gender ratio of 4.26:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> continued rising after the age of 80 yr, with a gender ratio of 2.46:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The continuing rise in the <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> incidence rates in the elderly demonstrated that the unexpected decline and fall in the incidence rates of ACE over the age of 80 yr did not result from underdiagnosis but were most probably caused by a declining prevalence rate of BE, restricting the elderly BE subpopulation at risk of developing ACE </plain></SENT>
