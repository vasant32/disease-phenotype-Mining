<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IP6 has been reported to have significant inhibitory effects against a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that IP6 would inhibit the cell growth rate of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines, SEG-1 and BIC-1, were treated with IP6 at 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mM concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell viability was measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> were evaluated by the Annexin V <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reductions (P&lt;0.001) in cellular proliferation were observed in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IP6 decreased late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in BIC cells, whereas in SEG-1 cells, early <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> increased by IP6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IP6 decreases cellular growth by pro-apoptotic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that IP6 has the potential to become an effective adjunct for Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate safety and clinical utility of this agent in patients with Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
