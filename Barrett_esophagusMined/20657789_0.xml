<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the rapid rise in incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, screening for BE with subsequent surveillance when found has been proposed as a method of early detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sedated endoscopy, however, is too expensive for wide spread screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, other techniques including unsedated transnasal esophagoscopy and capsule esophagoscopy have been proposed to expand screening programs </plain></SENT>
