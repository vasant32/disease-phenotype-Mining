<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined telomere length and <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> (CIN) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> biopsies using fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study CIN, we selected centromere and locus-specific arm probes to chromosomes 17/17p (p53), 11/11q (cyclin D1), and 9/9p (p16 INK4A), loci reported to be involved in early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telomere shortening was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> epithelium at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histologic grades, whereas CIN was highest in biopsies with dysplastic changes; there was, however, considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between patients in each variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alterations on chromosome 17 were strongly correlated with telomere length (r = 0.55; P &lt; 0.0001) and loss of the 17p arm signal was the most common event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CIN on chromosome 11 was also associated with telomere shortening (r =0.3; P = 0.05), although 11q arm gains were most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On chromosome 9p, arm losses were the most common finding, but chromosome 9 CIN was not strongly correlated with telomere length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CIN is related to telomere shortening in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> but varies by chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether instability is manifested as loss or gain seems to be influenced by the chromosomal loci involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because telomere shortening and CIN are early events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> and are highly variable among patients, it will be important to determine whether they identify a subset of patients that is at risk for more rapid neoplastic evolution </plain></SENT>
