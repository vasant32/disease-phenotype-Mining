<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability to distinguish between GER and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is increasingly important to implement best practices in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> in patients across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pediatric age groups, as children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> may benefit from further evaluation and treatment, whereas conservative recommendations are the only indicated therapy in those with uncomplicated physiologic reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This clinical report endorses the rigorously developed, well-referenced North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition guidelines and likewise emphasizes important concepts for the general pediatrician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A key issue is distinguishing between clinical manifestations of GER and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in term infants, children, and adolescents to identify patients who can be managed with conservative treatment by the pediatrician and to refer patients who require consultation with the gastroenterologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the evidence basis presented by the guidelines for diagnostic approaches as well as treatments is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle changes are emphasized as first-line therapy in both GER and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, whereas medications are explicitly indicated only for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical therapies are reserved for children with intractable symptoms or who are at risk for life-threatening complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent black box warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration are discussed, and caution is underlined when using promoters of gastric emptying and motility </plain></SENT>
