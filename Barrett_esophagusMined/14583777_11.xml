<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this investigation, the p53 status of a Welsh population of Barrett's-associated oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were fully characterised at the gene sequence, chromosomal, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 31 tumours were examined for p53 gene sequence mutations using RFLP with sequencing, allelic loss of the gene was characterised by FISH, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression by p53 pathway signalling arrays and protein levels by p53 immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 9.6% of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> harboured p53 mutations, 24% displayed p53 allelic loss and 83% exhibited p53 protein accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Point mutations and deletions of the gene did not coexist within the same samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples containing p53 mutations also displayed positive immunostaining; however; in the majority of cases, p53 protein accumulation developed in the absence of mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gene expression analysis demonstrated no differences in p53 and mdm-2 transcription levels between the p53 immunonegative and immunopositive samples, indicating other mechanisms underlie the proteins' overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, p53 mutations and deletions do not appear to be frequent events in oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>; however, abnormal accumulation of the protein is present in a vast majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>P53 gene mutations are not the primary cause of protein overexpression--an alternative mechanism is responsible for the positive p53 immunohistochemistry detected </plain></SENT>
