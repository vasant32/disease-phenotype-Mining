<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize cost and health outcomes for current treatment pathways for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and to model comparative net clinical and economic benefits of alternative management scenarios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A decision-analytic model of real-world practices for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> treatment by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage was constructed and validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model synthesized treatment probabilities, survival, quality of life, and resource use extracted from epidemiological datasets, published literature, and expert opinion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparative analyses between current practice and five hypothetical scenarios for modified treatment were undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 5 years, outcomes across T stage ranged from 4.06 quality-adjusted life-years and costs of $3,179 for HGD to 1.62 quality-adjusted life-years and costs of $50,226 for stage T4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Greater use of endoscopic mucosal resection for stage T1 and measures to reduce esophagectomy mortality to 0-3 % produced modest gains, whereas a 20 % reduction in the proportion of patients presenting at stage T3 produced large incremental net benefits of $4,971 (95 % interval, $1,560-8,368) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings support measures that promote earlier diagnosis, such as developing risk assessment processes or endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incremental net monetary benefits for other strategies are relatively small in comparison to predicted gains from early detection strategies </plain></SENT>
