<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of Barrett's-associated esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is rising, but experience in the treatment of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on an endoscopic surveillance program, the authors developed a systematic multidisciplinary approach to this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surgical resection was considered if biopsies of the Barrett's segment, performed according to a published protocol, showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e>, intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, or repeated evidence of HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The type of resection was based on the length of the Barrett's segment and included an en bloc lymph node dissection for staging purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Careful intraoperative pathologic evaluation ensured that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the Barrett's mucosa was resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1984 to 1993, 27 consecutive patients (23 men, 4 women), with median age of 61 years (range, 45-75 years) underwent surgical exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indications for operation were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> in 17 patients, intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 5 patients, and HGD in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median length of the Barrett's segment was 9 cm (range, 1-17 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 15 patients (55%) had abnormalities visible with endoscopic examination that were potentially suspicious for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients underwent resection with complete removal of the Barrett's mucosa, 20 by Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy, and 6 by transhiatal esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pathologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stages were: TisN0M0 in 10 patients; T1N0M0 in 11 patients; T2N0M0 in 2 patients; T3N0M0 in 3 patients; and T1NXM1 in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or anastomotic leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Major complications occurred in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 3.7 years, 22 patients were alive, and only 2 patients had recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This increasingly important group of patients with HGD or early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has a high chance of cure but requires careful multidisciplinary treatment by the surgeon, gastroenterologist, and pathologist </plain></SENT>
