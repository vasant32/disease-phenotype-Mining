<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: No community-based, large-scale studies have examined the extent of prescribing acid-reducing medications or adherence and persistence to these medication regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) without BE, diagnosed between 2000 and 2005, who had undergone an upper endoscopy within 1 year through a managed care plan in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified filled prescriptions for oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>-2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (H2RAs) within 365 days after the index date of BE or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, and several measures of adherence (medication-ownership ratio (MOR)) and persistence (length of therapy, fill-refill ratio, discontinuation rate) for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 10,159 patients with BE and 48,965 GERD patients with no BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of filled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> prescriptions accounted for only 30.2% of the available year after the index date, whereas that of either <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> or H2RA prescriptions accounted for only 31.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> prescriptions were filled by 66.6 and 60.4% of patients with and without BE, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These proportions declined significantly between 2000 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For those with at least one prescription, the median duration of therapy was 241 days for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> and 159 for H2RAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both groups had low MOR and length of treatment and high discontinuation rates; however, adherence and persistence were significantly higher in BE than in non-BE patients, and significantly lower in 2005 than in 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of prescription <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> or H2RAs, as well as adherence and persistence with these medications, is lower than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The absence of BE and more recent diagnosis are associated with even lower prescription rates </plain></SENT>
