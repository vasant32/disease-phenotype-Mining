<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, adenoviral transduction efficacy in vivo is still limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This efficacy can be improved by the insertion of an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in the HI-loop of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> fiber knob </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed in established esophageal cell lines, we observed an up to six-fold improved transduction using the RGD-targeted adenovirus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Established cell lines, however, are easily transformed and do not represent the more complex in vivo histology and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we set up an esophageal explant model using esophageal biopsies from patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Viability is a limiting factor for this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cultured squamous epithelium, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> had a sufficient viability to study adenoviral transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Viability of the cultured <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> biopsies was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adenoviral transduction in the explant model was poor and was localized in particular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The transduction of the nontargeted and RGD-targeted adenovirus was similar in localization and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we established an esophageal explant system to test the transduction of adenoviral vectors ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The transduction was limited and localized in specific cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RGD-targeted adenovirus did not show an improved transduction in this system </plain></SENT>
