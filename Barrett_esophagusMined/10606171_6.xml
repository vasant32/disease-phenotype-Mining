<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and cardia is increasing at an alarming rate, major efforts are currently oriented to identify patients who may benefit from extensive resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between November 1992 and May 1998, 218 patients with histologically proven <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal esophagus or cardia were referred to our Department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In six patients (10.2%) with Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was discovered during endoscopic surveillance program for Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, one hundred-forty-seven patients (67%) underwent resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one underwent an extended mediastinal lymphadenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median cumulative survival was 25.9+/-3.1 months in patients undergoing resection, and 7+/-1.3 months in patients having palliation (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was significantly longer in patients with negative nodes than in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> (54+/-12.9 versus 17+/-2.8 months, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of the 51 patients (11.8%) undergoing extended lymphadenectomy had metastatic upper mediastinal nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional serial sections and immunohistochemistry were performed in 46 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 6 of 18 patients (33.3%) with negative nodes at conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin examination, immunohistochemistry demonstrated micrometastases in the lesser curve, paracardial, peripancreatic, or lower mediastinal nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis remains the prerequisite for curative treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When a curative resection is attempted, extended lymphadenectomy improves <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging and may prevent local recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Serial sections and immunohistochemistry provide additional accuracy in the staging of the disease and may prove useful to select patients for adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
