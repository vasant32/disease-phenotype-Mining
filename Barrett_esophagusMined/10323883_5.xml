<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous reports have indicated an association between Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus and colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, but the findings have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If true, such an association suggests common causal mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To test the hypothesis of an association between Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus and colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population based, retrospective cohort study was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Swedish patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> diagnosed between 1958 and 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>538 500 person years at risk were reviewed among the 118 030 patients in the cohort (average follow up 4.6 years, median 2.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The standardised incidence ratio (SIR), the ratio of the observed to the expected number of incident oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, was used as a measure of relative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expected number was derived from the entire Swedish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were found during follow up in the cohort, as against 9.5 expected (SIR=1.2; 95% confidence interval 0.6-2.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis by latency intervals after diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> showed no trend towards increasing or decreasing risk over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no important sex differences in relative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results provide no support for a common link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the direct relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was not looked at, a search for common aetiological factors or genetic defects may not be fruitful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Screening for colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> among patients with malignant or premalignant oesophageal mucosa, or vice versa, may not be warranted </plain></SENT>
