<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been attributed mainly to anatomical location, but biological factors such as growth-regulatory molecules have been implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the expression of one of these factors, TGF alpha, and its precursor prepro TGF alpha in 82 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of GEJ (32 resected specimens and 50 biopsies) as well as in 48 BE biopsies without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, by immunohistochemistry and by Western-blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TGF alpha staining was shown in the cytoplasm and membrane of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot confirmed that most immunoreactivity was against mature TGF alpha (5.6 kDa), but higher-molecular-weight bands were also identifiable, suggesting some reactivity with prepro protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TGF alpha expression was more extense and intense in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The tubular histological type of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was more often positive than the signet-ring type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Primary tumors</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph-node metastases</z:e> also had increased TGF alpha expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude, therefore, that there is differential regulation of the expression of TGF alpha and its precursors during esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
