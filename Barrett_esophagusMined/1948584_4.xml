<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Often, these patients are managed medically despite refractory symptoms for fear of surgical morbidity and mortality by referring physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This investigation was done to review the referral patterns and results of antireflux operations for patients more than 60 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The charts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing operation for reflux were reviewed during an eight year period from 1981 to 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and three patients underwent Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been treated with H2 blockers or antacids, or both, prior to referral for operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 1 (N = 43) consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who were 60 years of age and group 2 (N = 60), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients less than 60 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of those in group 1 was 70.6 years versus 43.7 years for those in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of symptoms was far greater in the elderly group versus the younger group (14.4 versus 4.1 years) (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients in group 1 were referred for surgical treatment because of complications of reflux versus only four in group 2 (p less than 0.01) in whom intractability was the main indication for surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The specific complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> that led to the referral of elderly patients for operation were stricture, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and this occurred in a 46 year old woman who had a massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up study was 5.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Improvement in symptoms was noted by 37 patients in group 1 versus 56 in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that elderly patients are most often referred for antireflux operations for complications of reflux versus younger patients in whom intractability is the most common indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Earlier referral is warranted if reflux symptoms persist despite adequate medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Despite advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e>, the results of antireflux operations are good, and surgical morbidity and mortality rates are low enough to warrant intervention in this group of patients, provided no medical contraindications exist </plain></SENT>
