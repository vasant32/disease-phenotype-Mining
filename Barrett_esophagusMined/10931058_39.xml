<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mortality, morbidity and survival rates in patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> having oesophageal resection were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients were observed from 1982 to 1998; the first seven patients were offered primary oesophageal resection after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other eight patients underwent a second endoscopy with a median of 12 biopsies examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> later underwent oesophageal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was found in five patients, with a minimal difference between the first and second periods (two of seven versus three of eight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early morbidity was observed in eight patients and late morbidity in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate was 79 per cent at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Karnofsky status was unchanged from preoperative values in 13 of 15 patients after a median follow-up of 46 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had a 33 per cent probability of harbouring invasive oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> but even a second endoscopy failed to identify patients with invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Oesophagectomy was performed with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and remains a rational treatment in patients fit for surgery </plain></SENT>
