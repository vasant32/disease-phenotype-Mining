<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether tobacco smoking and other factors increase risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from 5 case-control studies included in the international Barrett's and Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> Consortium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared data from subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 1059) with those from subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> controls, n = 1332), and population-based controls (n = 1143), using multivariable logistic regression models to test associations with cigarette smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also tested whether cigarette smoking has synergistic effects with other exposures, which might further increase risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were significantly more likely to have ever smoked cigarettes than the population-based controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-2.67) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> controls (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.33-1.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing pack-years of smoking increased the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was evidence of a synergy between ever-smoking and heartburn or regurgitation; the attributable proportion of disease among individuals who ever smoked and had heartburn or regurgitation was estimated to be 0.39 (95% CI: 0.25-0.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association was strengthened with increased exposure to smoking until âˆ¼20 pack-years, when it began to plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Smoking has synergistic effects with heartburn or regurgitation, indicating that there are various pathways by which tobacco smoking might contribute to development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
