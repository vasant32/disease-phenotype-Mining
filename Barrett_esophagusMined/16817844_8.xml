<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anecdotal experience suggests that gastroenterologists are encountering fewer patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo>; however, the temporal trends of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> have not been well examined in large studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the incidence rates of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>esophageal dilations</z:mp> among patients presenting to VA facilities between 1998 and 2003 as a proportion of the annual frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> endoscopic procedures and/or imaging procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recurrent strictures were defined as those recorded at least 3 months after the index date of a new stricture or the date of the preceding recurrent stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stricture was defined only in the presence of an upper endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal (UGI) contrast imaging within 30 days before or after the date of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This algorithm was validated by manually reviewing the medical records of 180 patients; the positive predictive value was approximately 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of recurrent strictures was examined using Cox proportional hazards model for multiple failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 19,157 patients identified between fiscal year (FY) 1998 and FY 2003 with new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New strictures comprised a constant annual proportion of total EGD and UGI imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New strictures declined by 11.6% as a proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> upper endoscopies (not including UGI imaging) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>esophageal dilations</z:mp> associated with new stricture diagnoses declined among patients with new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo>, 16.8% had at least one episode of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 1-yr incidence rate of recurrent strictures declined significantly (-36.0%) from 13.9 per 100 person-years for patients diagnosed with new strictures in 1998 to 8.9 per 100 person-years in patients diagnosed with new strictures in 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the full multivariable model, new strictures diagnoses during 2001-2003 were associated with a reduced risk of having recurrent strictures (19% in the first year and 13% throughout follow-up) independent of age, gender, race, geographic region, or the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of recurrent strictures has declined between 1998 and 2003 by approximately one-third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although there has been only a small decline in the incidence of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> among patients undergoing endoscopy, the use of <z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>esophageal dilations</z:mp> has declined considerably among these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> needs to be examined </plain></SENT>
