<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Magnification endoscopy with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> or dye for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is presently undergoing clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current studies report good accuracy in predicting specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, however, there is no definitive information on the inter- and intra-observer variability of these methods applied to the diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and dysplastic Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty patients with endoscopically suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were investigated prospectively with the zoom endoscope after contrast enhancement of the mucosa with 1.5% <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and twenty-three enlarged and histologically investigated areas of gastric, cardiac, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and dysplastic Barrett's mucosa were photodocumented and in randomized sequence presented to 4 endoscopists in a blinded manner (2 with and 2 without experience of zoom endoscopy for evaluation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reference for the first evaluation (A1) was standard endoscopic photographs of the respective, histologically confirmed mucosal entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a second evaluation (A2), the pictures were again interpreted by the same blinded investigators, but this time a modified pit-pattern classification as proposed by Sharma et al. was employed as the evaluation reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnostic sensitivity for specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> calculated for the A1 evaluation ranged -- investigator dependently -- from 54.9% to 80.7% and for A2 from 42.2% to 81.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inter- and intra-observer variability for the evaluation procedure A1 and A2 was high (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kappa values &lt;0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, the inexperienced investigators demonstrated high intra-observer variability and low sensitivity in comparison with the experienced investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of Barrett's mucosa using enhanced magnification endoscopy after <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> instillation is associated with a high level of interobserver variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One reason is a frequent mismatch between cardiac mucosa and non-dysplastic Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
