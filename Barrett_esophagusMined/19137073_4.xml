<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) is very high in northern China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> has a very poor prognosis, mostly because it is usually diagnosed at a late stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detection at an earlier stage can dramatically improve prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microscopic evaluation of esophageal balloon cytology (EBC) specimens has been the most common method for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>, but this technique is limited by low sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of molecular markers may improve these screening characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates whether measurement of gene methylation in EBC specimens may have utility for the detection of esophageal squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the presence of methylation in eight genes shown to be methylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> in previous studies in EBC specimens from 147 patients with endoscopic biopsy diagnoses ranging from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa to severe squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Methylation status was determined using quantitative methylation-specific PCR techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of methylation of each individual gene and of combinations of these genes to detect biopsyproven high-grade (moderate or severe) squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For individual genes, the sensitivities ranged from 9% to 34% and the specificities ranged from 77% to 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using a panel of four genes (AHRR, p16INK4a, MT1G, and CLDN3) resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 50% and 68%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that evaluation of gene methylation in EBC samples may have utility for early detection of esophageal squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>; however, identification of more sensitive methylation markers will be required for development of a clinically useful screening test </plain></SENT>
