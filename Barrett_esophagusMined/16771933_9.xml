<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The number of patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has increased in recent decades, although data from populations outside Europe and North America are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This increase has significant implications for health resource utilization and costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine changes in the endoscopic frequency of new cases of BE in an Australian population during the period 1990-2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons newly diagnosed with BE in an Australian health region in 1990, 1998, and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BE cases were categorized as short segment (SSBE) (&lt;3 cm), long segment (&gt;or=3 cm), or undefined length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the total number of esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) and the number of new cases of BE for the three time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2002, the endoscopic frequency of new cases of BE increased from 2.9 to 18.9 per 1,000 endoscopies (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The greatest increase was for SSBE, increasing from no new cases in 1990 to 6.2 new cases per 1,000 EGD in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast there was a 17% decrease (2.3-1.9 new cases per 1,000 EGD) for long segment BE during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 3,090 EGDs undertaken in 1990, 3,518 in 1998, and 2,593 in 2002, an increase of 14% over the first 8-yr interval (p&lt;0.001), and a decline of 26% over the subsequent 4 yr (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In an Australian population undergoing EGD, the endoscopic frequency and absolute number of new cases of BE, particularly SSBE disease, has increased significantly between 1990 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This increased frequency of patients diagnosed with BE has broad future economic and clinical implications </plain></SENT>
