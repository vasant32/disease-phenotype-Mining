<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because light microscopy of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> shows diminished or absent mucus, we used transmission electron microscopy to compare cytoplasmic organelles required for mucus production in dysplastic and nondysplastic esophageal columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These observations of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and secretory granules were correlated with histologic interpretations and flow cytometric measurements of abnormalities of DNA content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural abnormalities included <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and alteration of organelles required for mucus biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities often were accompanied by cells with markedly distended rough endoplasmic reticulum and massive accumulation of cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> aggregates </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities measured by flow cytometry correlated well with the presence of these ultrastructural aberrations </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the 3 patients whose biopsies were indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and who had ultrastructural abnormalities also had <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> or increased G2/tetraploid fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither ultrastructural nor flow cytometric abnormalities were found in the remaining 5 patients whose biopsies were indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, in 19 of 22 patients with Barrett's specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, or in any of the 7 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> without Barrett's specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of the 22 patients with Barrett's specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> had distended rough endoplasmic reticulum in rare cells, and one other had an aneuploid cell population </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With few exceptions, these ultrastructural aberrations correspond to the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> or increased G2/tetraploid fractions </plain></SENT>
