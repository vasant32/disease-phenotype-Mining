<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In view of the rapidly increasing incidence of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, a desirable aim would be to detect intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> via the endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Where something new is growing, it should give rise to visible changes in surface structure, in particular, in the case of the early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to investigate this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 600 formalin-fixed endoscopically resected specimens (317 patients) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were prospectively investigated by stereomicroscopy (magnification up to x 90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surface structure was classified into regular (finely granulated or ridged gyriform) and irregular (coarsely granulated, polypoid elevated or depressed), and compared with the results of the histological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 88.5 % of the Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, and 76 % and 68 %, respectively, of the cases of high-grade and low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were associated with an irregular surface structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, coarsely granulated mucosal surfaces, reflecting regenerative changes, were also found in 26 % of the cases of Barrett's mucosa without intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite formalin fixation, 68 - 88.5 % of the cases of early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> can be identified by stereo microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This shows that high-resolution videoendoscopy or magnification endoscopy appears to be a highly suitable method for the targeted detection of early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
