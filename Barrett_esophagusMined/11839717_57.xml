<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins are essential for eukaryotic DNA replication, and their expression implies potential for cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression is dysregulated in dysplastic states but data for oesophageal squamous mucosa and Barrett's mucosa have not been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To test the hypothesis that Mcm proteins are downregulated together with the proliferation marker Ki-67 in differentiating epithelial compartments of non-dysplastic squamous and Barrett's epithelium, and that this process does not occur in dysplastic mucosae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND CASES: Forty five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> included 20 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002163'>glandular dysplasia</z:mp> (10 low grade, eight high grade, two both, and four with invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty five other patients included 12 with oesophageal squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (three low grade, six high grade, three both, and four with invasive squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections from biopsy series and resections were immunostained using antibodies to Mcm2, Mcm5, and Ki-67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Percentage of nuclei positive for Mcm2, Mcm5, and Ki-67 was estimated and scored from 0 to 6 as: 0, none +; 1, &lt;10%+; 2, 10-30%+; 3, 30-70%+; 4, 70-90%+; 5, &gt;90%+; 6, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four separate epithelial strata were scored: in squamous epithelium the basal layer and thirds to the surface, in Barrett's mucosa the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface, upper and lower crypt, and deep glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In non-dysplastic squamous epithelium and Barrett's mucosa, high level expression of Mcm2, Mcm5, and Ki-67 proteins was largely confined to the proliferative compartments and downregulated in differentiated compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression persisted up to the mucosal surface in dysplastic squamous epithelium and Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Persistent expression of Mcm2, Mcm5, and Ki-67 proteins in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> compartments of dysplastic oesophageal squamous epithelium and dysplastic Barrett's mucosa may be diagnostic markers and imply disruption of cell cycle control and differentiation in these dysplastic epithelia </plain></SENT>
