<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A dramatic increase in the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has occurred among men in the United States over the last two decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying reasons remain largely unknown, although the increasing prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> likely plays a role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arise in a metaplastic epithelium termed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) that develops in approximately 10% of persons who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Persons with BE are at high risk (0.5-1.0%/year) of progressing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a cross-sectional study of 429 persons with BE, we evaluated the associations between <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased body mass index</z:mp>, anthropometric measures, cigarette smoking, use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) and markers of increased risk, including <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, increased 4N fraction, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 17p and 9p alleles, and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression models adjusting for age, gender, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use, and cigarette smoking, increasing waist:hip ratio was related to increasing risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (trend P = 0.01), 17p LOH (trend P = 0.005), and 9p LOH (trend P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios comparing highest to lowest quartiles were 4.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-15.6] for <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, 3.9 (95% CI, 1.3-11.4) for 17p LOH, and 2.7 (95% CI, 1.2-6.3) for 9p LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A nonsignificant trend was also observed for increased 4N fraction, whereas little association was found for HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar patterns of risk were noted for other anthropometric measures such as waist:thigh and abdomen:thigh ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that elevated body mass index increased risk of any of the biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Suggestive evidence also was found for a protective effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios for current users, compared with those who never used <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> regularly, were 0.6 (95% CI, 0.3-1.4) for increased 4N, 0.6 (95% CI, 0.3-1.3) for <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, 0.3 (95% CI, 0.1-0.7) for 17p LOH, and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.4-1.2) for HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no association between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use and risk of 9p LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that an abdominal distribution of body fat, which is more common in men and is termed male-pattern <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, may be a strong predictor of risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> among persons with BE and may account in part for the male predominance of BE and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We also conclude that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use may reduce the risk of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
