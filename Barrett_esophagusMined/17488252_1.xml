<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: During an endoscopic variceal ligation, we banded a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varix</z:e> with an overlying tongue of Barrett's epithelium (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One month later, the tongue was no longer visible, suggesting that banding could be used to eradicate BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the safety and efficacy of banding without resection (BWR) using a variceal banding device for eradicating BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From April 2004 through September 2005, 30 patients with BE were treated with BWR plus <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 20 mg t.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BWR was repeated monthly until two consecutive endoscopic and histological examinations showed no BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty Barrett's patients treated with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 20 mg t.i.d. alone served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The BWR treatment group comprised 29 patients with short-segment BE (SSBE) and one with long-segment disease, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 of the control patients had SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 16.9 months (range 10-24 months), complete eradication of BE was achieved in 29 of 30 patients (97%) in the BWR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, BE persisted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 control patients during the same period (P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean total number of bands applied per patient was 6.1 (range 1-14) and the mean number of sessions for complete eradication was 3.1 (range 1-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse events included only mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> that resolved within days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BWR appears to be a safe, effective, simple, and widely available technique for eradicating SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is a pilot study and we do not recommend the ablation of nondysplastic BE at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed </plain></SENT>
