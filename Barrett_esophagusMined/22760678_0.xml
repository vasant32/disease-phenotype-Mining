<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated current standards and treatment strategies for EBC in eight countries in Western Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A standardized questionnaire with questions on the endoscopic diagnosis, staging, and treatment of EBC was developed and sent to 107 university gastroenterology departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed anonymously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate was 49 % (52/107) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For work-up of early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, 67 % of hospitals use high-resolution endoscopes, with routine four-quadrant and targeted biopsies of visible lesions in 94 % of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Narrow-band imaging and chromoendoscopy are used in 67 % of the cases, and other advanced imaging and staining techniques in 65 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, 63 % of the respondents recommended conventional endosonography, 6 % miniprobe endosonography, and 19 % both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic resection is carried out at 98 % of the hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation is used for ablation in 52 % of the cases and radiofrequency ablation in 27 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An 80-year-old patient with localized mucosal EBC would be treated endoscopically in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic therapy was recommended for 50-year-old patients with mucosal EBC by 87 % of the hospitals; esophageal resection was recommended for multifocal EBC by 15 % in 80-year-old patients, by 63 % in 50-year-old patients and by 44 % in patients with incipient submucosal infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: About two-thirds of the university hospitals use high-resolution endoscopy and advanced imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic therapy is the accepted standard for treating localized mucosal Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in Western Europe; esophageal resection is recommended by the majority (63 %) for a young patient with multifocal EBC </plain></SENT>
