<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum samples in 10 Î¼L aliquots are enzymatically treated to cleave the N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> that are subsequently reacted with 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid to add charge and a fluorescent label </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Separations at 1250 V/cm and over 22 cm yielded efficiencies up to 700,000 plates for the N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> and analysis times under 100 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of the peak areas and migration times are used to evaluate N-glycan profiles from native and desialylated samples and determine differences among the four sample groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With microchip electrophoresis, we are able to distinguish the three patient groups from each other and from disease-free individuals </plain></SENT>
