<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway is important in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the EGF A61G homozygous variant genotype (GG) is (a) both a risk and poor prognostic factor for EAC and (b) associated with higher EGF serum levels in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using unconditional logistic regression, we compared EGF A61G in 312 EAC cases and 447 GERD-free controls, adjusting for age, gender, smoking history, and healthy adult body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the method of Kaplan and Meier, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazard models, we correlated EGF A61G with overall and failure-free survival in the EAC cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum EGF levels and EGF genotype (G/G versus others) were correlated in 144 GERD patients using Wilcoxon rank sum tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The EGF A61G G/G genotype conferred increased EAC risk, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.81 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.7), and was even higher in the subgroup of EAC patients with concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (adjusted odds ratio, 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, EGF A61G was not associated with a more aggressive phenotype or prognosis in EAC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher serum EGF levels were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients carrying G/G compared with A/A or A/G (P = 0.03, Wilcoxon rank sum test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The EGF A61G G/G genotype is associated with a near 2-fold greater risk of EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The G/G allele was also associated with higher EGF levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EGF genotyping can potentially identify high-risk patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> who might benefit from increased surveillance </plain></SENT>
