<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the role of Bmi-1 in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the amplification and high expression of Bmi-1 and the associated clinicopathologic characteristics in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The protein expression level of Bmi-1 was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) from tissue microarrays (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>) constructed at the University of Rochester from using tissues accrued between 1997 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Types of tissues included <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients' survival data, demographics, histologic diagnoses and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intensity (0-3) and percentage of Bmi-1 expression on <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> slides were scored by two pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA from 116 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was analyzed for copy number aberrations using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fisher exact tests and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to analyze data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By IHC, Bmi-1 was focally expressed in the basal layers of almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> esophageal squamous mucosa, which was similar to previous reports in other organs related to stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High Bmi-1 expression significantly increased from squamous epithelium (7%), columnar cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (22%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (22%), to low- (45%) and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (43%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression level of Bmi-1 was significantly associated with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, Bmi-1 amplification was detected by DNA microarray in a low percentage (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, high Bmi-1 expression did not show an association with overall survival in both esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that high expression Bmi-1 is associated with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e>, which implies that Bmi-1 plays an important role in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
