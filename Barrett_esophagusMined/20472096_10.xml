<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is an important diagnostic, staging, and therapeutic tool for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE)-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the histopathologic characteristics of specimens collected during EMR compared with biopsy specimens from patients with BE and assessed interobserver variability in pathologists' assessment of EMR and biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated EMR (n = 251) and biopsy (n = 269) specimens collected from patients with BE at 2 tertiary referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A detailed histologic analysis was performed for each EMR and biopsy specimen to determine the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, depth of the specimen, proportion of specimen with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and quality of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement for both biopsy and EMR specimens (among 4 experienced pathologists) was calculated by using kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histologic analysis showed that submucosa was present in the majority of EMRs, compared with biopsy specimens (88% vs 1%, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy specimens (99%) included lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the muscularis mucosa was observed in only 58% of biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For both EMR and biopsy specimens, the highest grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> comprised &lt; or =25% of the total area in &gt;50% of the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement on the diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was significantly greater for EMR specimens than biopsy specimens (low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 0.33 vs 0.22, P &lt; .001; high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 0.43 vs 0.35, P = .018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Submucosa can be examined in most samples collected from EMR; the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is focal within biopsy and EMR specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is more interobserver agreement among pathologists in the analysis of EMR samples than biopsy specimens for the diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
