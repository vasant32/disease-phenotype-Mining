<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to provide consensus recommendations based on the medical literature that clinicians could use to manage patients with BE and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), or early-stage EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed an international, multidisciplinary, systematic, evidence-based review of different management strategies for patients with BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early-stage EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a Delphi process to develop consensus statements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of literature searches were screened using a unique, interactive, Web-based data-sifting platform; we used 11,904 papers to inform the choice of statements selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An a priori threshold of 80% agreement was used to establish consensus for each statement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-one of the 91 statements achieved consensus despite generally low quality of evidence, including 8 clinical statements: (1) specimens from endoscopic resection are better than biopsies for staging lesions, (2) it is important to carefully map the size of the dysplastic areas, (3) patients that receive ablative or surgical therapy require endoscopic follow-up, (4) high-resolution endoscopy is necessary for accurate diagnosis, (5) endoscopic therapy for HGD is preferred to surveillance, (6) endoscopic therapy for HGD is preferred to surgery, (7) the combination of endoscopic resection and radiofrequency ablation is the most effective therapy, and (8) after endoscopic removal of lesions from patients with HGD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas of BE should be ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We developed a data-sifting platform and used the Delphi process to create evidence-based consensus statements for the management of patients with BE and early-stage EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This approach identified important clinical features of the diseases and areas for future studies </plain></SENT>
