<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Populations at risk for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> remain poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laryngeal symptoms can be secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1168250" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngopharyngeal reflux</z:e> (LPR) and can occur without associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GOAL:: We sought to determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in otolaryngology patients with laryngeal symptomsÂ±typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY:: We performed a cross-sectional study of otolaryngology clinic patients who reported laryngeal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms, medications, and exposure histories were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unsedated transnasal endoscopy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suspected BE was biopsied and confirmed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors and prevalence of BE were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Two hundred ninety-five patients were enrolled [73% male, median age 60 y (interquartile range 51 to 68 y)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of BE was 11.8% (n=33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Antisecretory medication use was present in 56% (n=156) of patients at enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients without BE, patients with BE were more likely to be male (P=0.01) and to report occupational lung injury (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Duration, but not severity of laryngeal symptoms, significantly increased the odds of BE (odds ratio, 5.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-24.83; for a duration of symptoms &gt;5 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of patients with BE, 58% (n=19) had coexisting LPR and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms and 30% (n=10) had only LPR symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Presence and size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and length of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> were significant risk factors for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Long-standing laryngeal symptoms are associated with the presence of BE in otolaryngology patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> laryngeal symptoms and no identifiable ear, nose, or throat etiology for those symptoms may benefit from endoscopic screening regardless of whether typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms are present </plain></SENT>
