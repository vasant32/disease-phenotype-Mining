<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">Capsaicin</z:chebi>-sensitive sensory afferents were shown to play a role in the maintenance of mucosal integrity of the GI tract, and regulation of human esophageal motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of topical application of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>-containing red pepper sauce (Tabasco, 25%v/v, pH:7.0) suspension on the phasic activity of the human esophagus of healthy volunteers and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was based on the findings of esophagoscopy and histology taken from the squamocolumnar junction of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal motility was measured by perfusion manometry before and after application of red pepper sauce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">Capsaicin</z:chebi> containing red pepper sauce increases the motility response (LES tone, contraction amplitude, propagation velocity) of the human esophagus in healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This response failed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Impaired esophageal sensory motor function may serve as one etiologic role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
