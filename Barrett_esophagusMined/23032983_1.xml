<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The need to document the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in esophageal biopsies from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) to diagnose BE is debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of CLE in a large cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients undergoing upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting to the endoscopy unit at a tertiary referral center for their index upper endoscopy for evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms were enrolled in this prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were asked to complete a validated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> questionnaire that documents the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms (heartburn and acid regurgitation) and grades the frequency and severity of symptoms experienced over the past year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic information, body mass index, and use of aspirin/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</z:chebi> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic details including length of CLE, presence and size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with CLE (cases) were compared with those without CLE (controls) using Fischer's exact test and t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> factors that were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) were then entered into stepwise logistic regression to evaluate for independent predictors of CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1058 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On index endoscopy, the prevalence of CLE was 23.3%, whereas of CLE with documented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was 14.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, male gender, Caucasian race, heartburn duration of &gt;5 years, presence and size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> were significantly associated with the presence of CLE compared with controls (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, heartburn duration &gt;5 years (odds ratio (OR): 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-2.09, P=0.01), Caucasian race (OR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.42-4.03, P=0.001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (OR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.50-2.87, P&lt;0.01) were found to be independent predictors for CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CLE length was significantly associated with the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: If BE is defined by the presence of CLE alone on upper endoscopy, up to 25% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients are diagnosed with this lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Enrolling <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients in surveillance programs would have significant ramifications on health-care resources </plain></SENT>
