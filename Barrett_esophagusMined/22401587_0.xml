<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to compare objective and subjective outcomes of laparoscopic Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication after 2 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients underwent laparoscopic Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were subjected to close follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The DeMeester and Johnson score average decreased from a mean preoperative value of 35.48 (SD±40.24) to 9.83 (SD±6.40) at 6 months; at 12 months it was 11.44 (SD±10.28), and at 24 months it was 10.25 (SD±5.61) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Short Form-36 measurement showed significant improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients need adequate reflux control </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgical therapy is effective in terms of reflux control and improvement in quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Strict and rigorous follow-up with both subjective and objective tests is important in order to identify asymptomatic recurrence of reflux after surgery </plain></SENT>
