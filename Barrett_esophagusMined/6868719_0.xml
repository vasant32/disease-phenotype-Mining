<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the effects of alcohol on the regeneration of squamous epithelium, rats were fed a diet containing 2,5 g alcohol daily for 6 weeks after the junctional region between the squamous epithelium of their fore stomach and the columnar epithelium of their glandular chamber had been injured and denuded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to animals fed an isocaloric control diet the alcohol-fed rats showed neither major macroscopical nor histological differences in the regeneration process of the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under the influence of alcohol the mucosal border did not move in an orad direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, these results fail to support the hypothesis of alcohol promoting the replacement of defects in squamous epithelium by columnar epithelium which is thought to be the major pathomechanism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
