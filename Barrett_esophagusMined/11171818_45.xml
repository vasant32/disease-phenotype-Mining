<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has yet to be elucidated what factors determine the length of Barrett's mucosa in each individual patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine if there is a correlation between oesophageal acid exposure and the length of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also compared the extent of oesophageal acid exposure between patients with short segment (SSBE) and long segment (LSBE) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were recruited prospectively into the study from the outpatient gastroenterology clinic at the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and its anatomical characteristics were determined during upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring assessed the extent of oesophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between per cent total time pH less than 4 and length of Barrett's mucosa (r=0.6234, p=0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a significant correlation between per cent upright and supine time pH less than 4 and length of Barrett's mucosa (r=0.5847, p=0.0014 and r=0.6265 p=0.0006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with SSBE had significantly less oesophageal acid exposure than patients with LSBE, in terms of both per cent total time and per cent supine time pH less than 4 (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The length of Barrett's mucosa correlated with the duration of oesophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with LSBE experienced significantly more oesophageal acid exposure than patients with SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Duration of oesophageal acid exposure appears to be an important contributing factor in determining the length of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
