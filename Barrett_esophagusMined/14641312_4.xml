<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, 28 lesions of the super-minute <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> &lt;or= 1 mm in diameter were detected by pathological examinations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the K-ras codon 12 mutations in these super-minute <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were examined by DNA extraction using a microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that seven of 28 (25%) super-minute <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> lesions in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> showed K-ras mutation, and were a single mutation, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> being detected in three lesions and GAT being detected in four lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> lesions could be divided into two groups according to p53-LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two among three lesions with p53-LI over 90%, which were considered to be morphologically high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, showed K-ras mutations (both lesions: GGT--&gt;<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>), and 5 among 25 lesions with an average p53-LI of 58%, which were considered to be morphologically low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, showed K-ras mutation (four lesions: GGT--&gt;GAT, 1 lesion: GGT--&gt;<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This current study shows that some <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> lesions have K-ras mutations in their initial condition, whether these atypical tubule lesions are low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>), and supports the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence in the histogenesis of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and synchronously suggests that there is a different route to it </plain></SENT>
