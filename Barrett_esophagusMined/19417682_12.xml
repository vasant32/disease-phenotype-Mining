<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the risk factors for BE were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: An esophagogastroduodenoscopy examination was performed in 25,536 subjects who had upper endoscopy screening from January 2006 to July 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and fifteen subjects were confirmed to have BE by pathology, thus the prevalence of BE was calculated to be 0.84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic findings were subdivided into 2 groups: BE without reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE), which included 167 (77.7%), and BE with RE, which included 48 (22.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The analysis of symptoms showed that only 60.1% of the subjects with BE had reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>Chest pain</z:hpo> [odds ratio (OR): 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-2.11] and epigastric soreness (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.05-1.93) were found more frequently in the subjects with BE compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects with BE were a male sex (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.32-2.50), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> use (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.28-3.20), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (OR: 5.66, 95% CI: 3.70-8.66), and an age &gt; or = 60 compared with an age &lt; 40 (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.07-3.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference associated with RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of BE in Korean patients presenting for a routine health check-up was 0.84%, lower than reported in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the subjects with BE 77.7% did not have endoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> and there were no reflux symptoms in 39.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that regular endoscopic screening with a high index of suspicion is necessary for the diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
