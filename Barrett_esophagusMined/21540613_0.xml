<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of fundoplication in the prevention of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is associated with proliferation and anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, for which little data exist regarding their response to fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ki-67 and Bcl-2 expression was assessed in the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and the distal and proximal esophagus of 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) treated by fundoplication and in 7 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy was performed preoperatively and 6 (20 patients) and 48 months (16 patients) postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were positive correlations between Ki-67 and Bcl-2 levels in the EGJ (p &gt; 0.001) and in the distal (p = 0.001) and proximal esophagus (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to the preoperative level, Ki-67 expression was elevated in the distal (p = 0.012) and proximal (p = 0.007) esophagus at 48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, compared to control values, Ki-67 expression was lower at the 6-month follow-up in the EGJ (p = 0.037) and the proximal esophagus (p = 0.003), and higher at the 48-month follow-up in the distal esophagus (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to control values, Bcl-2 was lower at 6 months in the EGJ (p = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proliferative activity after fundoplication increased in the long term in the distal esophagus despite a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fundic wrap and healing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
