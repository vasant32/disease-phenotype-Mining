<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A multicentric study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) was started in November 1987 to evaluate (1) the prevalence of BE among subjects undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination; (2) the pathologic features of BE; and (3) the correlation between BE and early malignant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 157 of 330 patients who underwent multiple standardized biopsies, BE was confirmed with histologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specialized intestinal-type BE was observed in 84 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By applying Alcian blue (pH 2.5)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="49826">periodate</z:chebi> oxidation-Schiff, high-iron <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15571,23666">diamine</z:chebi>-Alcian blue (pH 2.5), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="49826">periodate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30157">borohydride</z:chebi>-saponification-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="49826">periodate</z:chebi> oxidation-Schiff techniques, the intestinal type of BE was subclassified into colonic and ileal types, both complete and incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty cases had incomplete colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> with sulphomucins in the columnar cells and 64 had complete colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, 49 of them containing O-acetylated sialomucins in the goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients are being included in a short-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> (six low grade, two high grade) was observed in eight patients in areas of intestinal colonic-type epithelium; in these patients, a complete loss of O-acetylated sialomucins in the dysplastic areas and a remarkable reduction of these mucins in the surrounding tissue were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduction of O-acetylated sialomucins might indicate relative tissue immaturity, which could represent an early sign of neoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the relevance of O-acetylated sialomucin content in BE, first demonstrated in intestinal type, is now evident, although its biologic importance is being studied </plain></SENT>
