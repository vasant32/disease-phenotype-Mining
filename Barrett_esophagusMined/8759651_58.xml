<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To prospectively determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of short segments of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Short segment is defined as extending less than 2 cm proximal to the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has been referred to by some investigators as "short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>." METHODS: One hundred and seventy two patients undergoing elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy were consecutively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> study patients completed a symptom questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At endoscopy, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and locations of the diaphragmatic hiatus, esophagogastric junction, and the squamocolumnar junction were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were obtained at the squamocolumnar junction to identify specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and 2 cm above the squamocolumnar junction to evaluate for histological <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients (1.2%) had at least 2 cm of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 170 patients without 2 cm of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e>, 16 (9.4%) patients had short segments of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve (7.0%) of these patients had specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> limited to the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were Caucasian, and there was a slight male predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients without specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (n = 154, 90.6%) did not differ statistically with respect to age, gender, use of acid-suppressing drugs, alcohol, or smoking history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pyrosis and regurgitation were significantly more common in patients with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> involving the distal 2 cm of the esophagus or the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cough was more common in the group with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> limited to the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The groups were similar in frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, globus sensation, nocturnal pyrosis, eructation, early satiety, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> less than 2 cm proximal to the esophagogastric junction is common in Caucasian patients undergoing routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Pyrosis and regurgitation are significantly more common in patients with short segments of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, whether involving the distal 2 cm of the esophagus or the esophagogastric junction alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Alcohol and tobacco use are no more common in patients with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> than in those without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The presence of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> did not correlate with either endoscopic or histological <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
