<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Specialized columnar epithelium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> resembles gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, which selectively stains with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the safety, accuracy, reproducibility, cost, and diagnostic yield of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi>-directed biopsy in detecting specialized columnar epithelium and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed upper endoscopy with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi>-directed biopsy and obtained 236 large cup biopsy specimens (145 stained, 91 unstained) from 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of any length (Group 1) and 12 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were independently examined by two pathologists unaware of the endoscopic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">Methylene blue</z:chebi> stained specialized columnar epithelium in 18 of the 26 patients, including those with intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (1), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (1), and indefinite/low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">Methylene blue</z:chebi> staining pattern, which was focal in 72% and diffuse in 28% of patients, was reproduced in 8 patients who had repeat staining within 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall accuracy of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> staining for detecting specialized columnar epithelium was 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic yield of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> staining for specialized columnar epithelium in "control" patients was 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in stained biopsy specimens was greater than in unstained ones (odds ratio 17.7, p = .0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">Methylene blue</z:chebi> mucosal staining is a safe, inexpensive, reproducible, and highly accurate method of diagnosing specialized columnar epithelium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
