<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whether early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> has a predilection for particular spatial locations in shorter segment disease is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anatomic factors may play a role in lesion location because of differing levels of mucosal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify high-risk lesion locations, which has important implications for surveillance strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We interrogated a prospectively maintained database of patients who underwent endoscopic resection (ER) for Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> at 2 Australian tertiary centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions targeted for ER were characterized and their location in the distal esophagus was noted as on a clock face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Z test of proportions was used to test for deviation from uniformity in the distribution of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Two Australian tertiary centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients who underwent ER for Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Lesion location in the distal oesophagus, resected specimen histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 146 consecutive patients had ER for biopsy-proven high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 75 patients had Barrett's segment length of 5 cm or less and a visible lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients had 2 visible lesions giving a total of 80 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ER of 66 lesions (82.5%) led to the identification of advanced pathology: 37 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (46%), 24 mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (30%), 5 submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of a total of 80 lesions, 43 (53.8%) (95% CI, 42.9%-64.7%) were centered within the 2- to 5-o'clock arc, comprising 25% of the circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This area also accounted for 36 (54.5%) of the 66 lesions with advanced histology (95% CI, 42.5%-66.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> confidence intervals lie wholly above the 25% expected in a uniform circular distribution (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Observational study in a tertiary center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Barrett's maximal segments of 5 cm or less, the 2- to 5-o'clock arc, accounts for approximately 50% of macroscopically visible lesions and associated early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This finding has important implications for surveillance strategies </plain></SENT>
