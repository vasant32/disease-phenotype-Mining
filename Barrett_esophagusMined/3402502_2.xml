<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Scintigraphy was performed with a semi solid bolus and the patient in an upright position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Condensed esophageal images were obtained from which we derived the esophageal transit time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of bolus transit was graded by the duration of transit and by the presence of hold up or retrograde motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scintigrams were performed in 11 volunteers and 88 patients whose esophageal function had been confirmed by conventional gastroesophageal techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Esophageal disorders</z:e> examined included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> (20), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> (9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> (8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (5), and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also examined the effects of gastroesophageal surgery on esophageal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transit times distinguished grossly abnormal esophageal function from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but did not distinguish between different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Graded transit patterns were a more sensitive indicator of esophageal function and permitted some differentiation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disorders</z:e> and allowed evaluation of the effects of gastroesophageal surgery </plain></SENT>
