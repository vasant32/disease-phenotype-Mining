<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current results of the laparoscopic approach are absolutely comparables with the results obtained during the open surgery era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Nissen, Nissen-Rossetti, or Toupet techniques are the more frequently used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have performed cardial calibration and posterior gastropexy or Nissen fundoplication by the open approach with similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this article is to present the anatomo-physiological basis for employing cardial calibration and posterior gastropexy in patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study includes 108 symptomatic patients, 12 of them with associated extraesophageal manifestations ( posterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023067" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngitis</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic mild or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was confirmed in 83 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 12 patients, and type I or II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were also submitted to manometry, 24 hour intraesophageal pH monitoring, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> swallow before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 12 to 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no conversion, major intraoperative, or postoperative complications; nor were there any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was present in 5% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic recurrence of reflux was observed in 10.3% and endoscopic presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 12.3% of cases  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lower esophageal sphincter pressure increased significantly after surgery, even in patients with endoscopic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>24-hour intraesophageal monitoring improved after surgery, except in patients with objective recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, laparoscopic cardial calibration with posterior gastropexy presents comparable results to those reported after Nissen fundoplication and therefore could be another excellent therapeutic option in patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
