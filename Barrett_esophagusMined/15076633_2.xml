<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (CF) have a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, but few cases of mucosal injury are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Duodenogastric reflux</z:e> has not been studied in CF but has been suggested to have a pathogenic role in producing alkaline injury to the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> in patients with CF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with CF and 7 healthy volunteers participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gastroduodenal manometry and intragastric perfusion were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gastric perfusate was analyzed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only patients and controls exhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> migrating motor complexes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients with CF had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motility recordings and had significantly higher gastric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels compared with healthy subjects (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration was associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> regurgitation in five patients with CF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> were conjugated with a high glycine/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> ratio and low levels of secondary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Small amounts of keto <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> were found in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The patients with CF had an increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> compared with healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> composition was typical for CF with low levels of secondary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentration was found in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> in most patients with CF, the less toxic profile of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> might possibly contribute to the low frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in CF </plain></SENT>
