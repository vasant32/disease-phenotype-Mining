<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> has been suggested; however, several studies addressing this issue have reported conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the prevalence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in a large group of patients (50-80 yr old; mean, 65 yr) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and compare it with that of a similar group of asymptomatic, average-risk controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-nine subjects (71 men, eight women) with well-documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent complete colonoscopy (cecum reached), which was performed as part of an initial screening evaluation for enrollment in a prospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control population (N = 930) is represented by the cumulative results of four recent studies in which screening colonoscopy was performed in asymptomatic subjects of average risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age of the two groups were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 38 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> were found in 26 patients in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients (4%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> &gt; 1 cm in size or with villous change, which was similar to the prevalence among asymptomatic controls (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of colon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> was 32%, and the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was 1% in the Barrett's group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group, 30% had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 0.5% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath>, both large and small, in a group of patients (ages 50-80 yr) with well-documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is no different from that in asymptomatic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results do not support the assumption of an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and an increased risk of colon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, or justify an aggressive surveillance strategy for colon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
