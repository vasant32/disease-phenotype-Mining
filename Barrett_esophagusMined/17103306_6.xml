<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using orally administered <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> as a probe of gastrointestinal permeability, this study focused on determining whether Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> exhibits a paracellular transepithelial leak to small nonelectrolytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects in five separate classes (nonendoscoped, asymptomatic controls; endoscoped, asymptomatic controls; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> without mucosal complications; grossly visible <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) consumed a <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> solution at bedtime and collected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> overnight urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urine volume was measured and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with Barrett's were observed to exhibit a transepithelial leak to <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> whose mean value was threefold greater than that seen in healthy control subjects or patients with reflux but without any mucosal defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A parallel study of claudin tight junction proteins in endoscopy biopsy samples showed that whereas Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> contains dramatically more claudin-2 and claudin-3 than is found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa, it is markedly lower in claudins 1 and 5, indicating very different tight junction barriers </plain></SENT>
