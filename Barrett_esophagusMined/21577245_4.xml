<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) have an increased risk of developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the absolute risk remains low, there is a need for predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> to tailor more individualized surveillance programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify such predictors of progression to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and EAC in patients with BE after 4 years of surveillance and to develop a prediction model based on these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 713 patients with BE (≥ 2 cm) with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND) or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) in a multicenter, prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), reflux symptoms, tobacco and alcohol use, medication use, upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy findings, and histology were prospectively collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As part of this study, patients with ND underwent surveillance every 2 years, whereas those with LGD were followed on a yearly basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Log linear regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with the development of HGD or EAC during surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 4 years of follow-up, 26/713 (3.4%) patients developed HGD or EAC, with the remaining 687 patients remaining stable with ND or LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis showed that a known duration of BE of ≥ 10 years (risk ratio (RR) 3.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-7.8), length of BE (RR 1.11 per cm increase in length; 95% CI 1.01-1.2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RR 3.5; 95% CI 1.3-9.5), and LGD (RR 9.7; 95% CI 4.4-21.5) were significant predictors of progression to HGD or EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a prediction model, we found that the annual risk of developing HGD or EAC in BE varied between 0.3% and up to 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with ND and no other risk factors had the lowest risk of developing HGD or EAC (&lt;1%), whereas those with LGD and at least one other risk factor had the highest risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> (18-40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with BE, the risk of developing HGD or EAC is predominantly determined by the presence of LGD, a known duration of BE of ≥10 years, longer length of BE, and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One or combinations of these risk factors are able to identify patients with a low or high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> and could therefore be used to individualize surveillance intervals in BE </plain></SENT>
