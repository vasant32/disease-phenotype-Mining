<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, studies on risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> have yielded inconsistent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to compare clinical features between symptomatic syndromes without esophageal injury (=non-erosive disease [NED]) and syndromes with esophageal injury (=erosive disease [ED]), and to determine risk factors associated ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 450 subjects who visited gastroenterology clinics of six training hospitals in Daegu from March 2008 to April 2010 were consecutively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire which inquired about <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire also included questions about smoking, alcohol drinking, consumption of coffee, use of drugs, exercise, and other medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subjects were subdivided into NED and ED groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of subjects in each NED and ED group was 172 (38.2%) and 278 (61.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Male gender, smoking, alcohol drinking, consumption of coffee, large waist circumference, infrequent medication of antacids, aspirin and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>, infrequent and mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly associated with ED on univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, body mass index, change in weight during 1 year, and number of typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms were not independent risk factors for ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the association between ED and alcohol drinking, infrequent medication of antacids, mild typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms remained as strong risk factors after adjustments on multivariate logistic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Independent risk factors associated with ED were alcohol drinking, infrequent medication of antacids and mild typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
