<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown that COX-2 mediates acid-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>₂ production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E synthase (PGES) responsible for acid-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> production in BE, however, is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that microsomal PGES1 (mPGES1), mPGES2, and cytosolic PGES (cPGES) were present in FLO EA cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulsed acid treatment significantly increased mPGES1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels but had little or no effect on mPGES2 or cPGES <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of mPGES1 by mPGES1 small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) blocked acid-induced increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> production and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase, NOX5-S, a variant lacking calcium-binding domains, by NOX5 siRNA significantly inhibited acid-induced increase in mPGES1 expression, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of NOX5-S significantly increased the luciferase activity in FLO cells transfected with a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in vivo activation reporter plasmid pNF-κB-Luc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of NF-κB1 p50 by p50 siRNA significantly decreased acid-induced increase in mPGES1 expression, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>₂ production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two novel NF-κB binding elements, GGAGTCTCCC and CGGGACACCC, were identified in the mPGES1 gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that mPGES1 mediates acid-induced increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>₂ production and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
