<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our efforts to define gene expression alterations in Barrett's-related <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (BA), we produced eight SAGE libraries and obtained a total of 457,894 expressed tags with 32,035 (6.9%) accounting for singleton tags </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples produced an average of 71,804 tags per library, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples produced an average of 42,669 tags per library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our libraries contained 67,200 unique tags representing 16,040 known gene symbols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five hundred and sixty-eight unique tags were differentially expressed between BAs and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue samples (at least twofold; P&lt;or=0.05), 395 of these matched to known genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the distribution of altered genes was not uniform across the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpressed genes tended to cluster in well-defined hot spots located in certain chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For example, chromosome 19 had 26 overexpressed genes, of which 18 mapped to 19q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using the gene ontology approach for functional classification of genes, we identified several groups that are relevant to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We validated the SAGE results of five representative genes (ANPEP, ECGF1, PP1201, EIF5A1, and GKN1) using quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR on 31 BA samples and 26 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we performed an immunohistochemistry analysis for ANPEP, which demonstrated overexpression of ANPEP in 6/7 (86%) Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> and 35/65 (54%) BAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ANPEP is a secreted protein that may have diagnostic and/or prognostic significance for Barrett's progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of genomic approaches in this study provided useful information about the molecular pathobiology of BAs </plain></SENT>
