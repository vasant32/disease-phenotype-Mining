<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the esophageal mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by reflux of different duodenal or bile in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Esophagus division in esophagogastric junction and then esophagoduodenostomy were performed on rats to make the models of duodenogastroesophageal reflux (DGER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three kinds of reflux model, DGER (Group A), duodenoesophageal reflux without gastric juice (Group B) and DGER without bile (Group C) were made by adjusting the DGER models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>9 weeks after operation, the esophageal mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was examined under microscope, and the esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was tested by DNA fragmentation in situ using TdT-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labling (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical method was used to detect the status of esophageal Fas protein (CD95) associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evidences of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats with different reflux models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>Esophageal inflammation</z:mp> was most severe in group A, then in group B, and the slightest in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was seen in group A and group B but not in group C, and the incidence was found to be of no difference between the A and B groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophageal mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> index in group A was (7.05 +/- 1.44)%, being significantly higher than that in group B (5.25 +/- 1.78)% and group C (2.84 +/- 1.36)%, (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> index was significantly higher in group B than in group C (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fas protein was negative in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> injured esophageal mucosal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The DGER without bile inflicts the slighest injury on the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bile may play a significant role in the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> indices increase in groups A, B and C, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is not correlated with Fas expression </plain></SENT>
