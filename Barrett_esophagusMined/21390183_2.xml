<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The CD95/CD95L pathway plays a critical role in tissue homeostasis and immune system regulation; however, the function of this pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that CD95L expression in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> confers advantages to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> other than immune privilege </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CD95L expression was characterized in immortalized squamous esophagus (HET-1A) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BAR-T) cells; <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines FLO-1, SEG-1, and BIC-1, and MDA468 (- control); and KFL cells (+ control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses included reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblots of whole cell and secretory vesicle lysates, FACScan analysis, laser scanning confocal microscopy of native proteins and fluorescent constructs, and assessment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and ERK1/2 pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cleaved, soluble CD95L is expressed at both the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in these cell lines derived from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and other human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD95L was neither trafficked to the cell membrane nor secreted into the media or within vesicles, rather the protein seems to be sequestered in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD95 and CD95L colocalize by immunofluorescence, but an interaction was not proven by immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of CD95L in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines induced robust <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and, under conditions of pan-caspase inhibition, resulted in activation of ERK signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CD95L localization in EA cells is inconsistent with the conference of immune privilege and is more consistent with a function that promotes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> through alternative CD95 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduced cell surface expression of CD95 affects cell sensitivity to extracellular apoptotic signals more significantly than alterations in downstream modulators of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
