<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Identification of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has been considered an indication for esophagectomy because of the high risk for coexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, rigorous endoscopic surveillance programs recently have been recommended, reserving esophagectomy for patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is identified on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This approach risks continued surveillance for patients who already have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> unless reliable markers for the presence of occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> are identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the endoscopic, histologic, and demographic features associated with the presence of occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in patients with HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic, histologic, and demographic findings for 31 patients who underwent esophagectomy for HGD were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, nodule, stricture, or raised area on preoperative endoscopy was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of endoscopic biopsies taken before resection every 1 to 2 cm along the Barrett's segment were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HGD was categorized as unilevel if the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was limited to one level of biopsy and as multilevel if more than one level was involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the resected specimens, and these variables were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of coexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in patients with HGD was 45% (14/31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 31 patients in this study, 9 had a visible lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> was found in the resected specimens from 7 (78%) of 9 patients with a visible lesion and 7 (32%) of 22 patients without a visible lesion (p = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of 22 patients without a visible lesion, 10 had multilevel and 12 had unilevel HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings showed that 6 (60%) of 10 patients with multilevel HGD and 1 (8.3%) of 12 patients with unilevel HGD had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the resected esophagus (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For patients with HGD, a lesion visible on endoscopy and/or HGD at multiple biopsy levels is associated with an increased risk for coexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These patients should be considered for early esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
