<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the gene expression profile of a panel of highly selected genes in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus epihelium of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, patients with Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and a healthy control group to define the existence of a carcinogenic field effect, and to investigate the clinical importance of such a field effect in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-nine histologic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal epithelia collected from 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 20 patients with Barrett's-associated esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and a healthy control group of 10 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR method (TaqMan) was used to measure the expression of a panel of genes with known associations with gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A widespread carcinogenic field effect was detected for more than 50% of the genes analyzed including Bax, BFT, CDX2, COX2, DAPK, DNMT1, GSTP1, RARalpha, RARgamma, RXRalpha, RXRbeta, SPARC, TSPAN, and VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the expression signature of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing squamous esophagus, a linear discriminant analysis was able to distinguish between the three groups of patients with an error rate of 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of a carcinogenic field effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the gene expression signature of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, patients could be correctly characterized according to their pathologic classification by applying a linear discriminant analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results provide evidence that a molecular classification might have clinical importance for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
