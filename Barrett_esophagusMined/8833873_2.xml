<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specimens from 94 patients were available for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The final diagnosis was based on surgical pathology and follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 81 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of the oesophagus had the following sex distribution: 64 males and 17 females(a 3.7-1 ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> was found in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following conclusions were made: (i) there is excellent correlation between cytology and histology in oesophageal lesions sampled by endoscopy; (ii) a correct positive cytologic report was obtained in 77 (95%) of the 81 proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancers</z:e>; a false-negative or unsatisfactory result was given in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A false-positive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was not made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 13 true-negative reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings result in a sensitivity of 83% with 95% CI of 74.82-91.18%; a specificity of 100% (CI of 98.5-100%) a positive predictive value of 100% (CI of 99.25-100%); a negative predictive value of 48% (CI of 29.16-64.84%); (iv) of 81 patients with proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, in 79 (98%) at least one of the methods was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In only two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were both methods negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These finding result in a combined sensitivity of 98% (CI of 94.92-100%); a specificity of 100% (CI of 98.5-100%); a positive predictive value of 100% (CI of 99.31-100%); and a negative predictive value of 87% CI of 70-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our series confirms the value of the combined use of cytology and biopsy for the investigation of oesophageal lesions </plain></SENT>
