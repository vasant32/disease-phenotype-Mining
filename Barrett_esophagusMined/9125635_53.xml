<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, accelerated modernization and adoption of Western customs have resulted in marked life-style changes in many Asians in the Orient that may potentially affect the frequency of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the current frequency of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> complications in self-referred Chinese patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in Taipei, Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between July 1991 and June 1992, 464 consecutive patients underwent endoscopy for a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal symptoms</z:e> at a major medical center </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six (14.5%) patients were found to have erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 9 (2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and 32 (7%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> showed a male-to-female preponderance of 3.1:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease severity increased with age and peaked during the sixth and seventh decades </plain></SENT>
