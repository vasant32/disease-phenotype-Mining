<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> arising in metaplastic Barrett's epithelium are presented in which multidirectional differentiation was demonstrated by light and/or electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and adjacent mucosa produced both neutral and acidic mucins, as well as one or more hormones indigenous to the gut, including gastrin, bombesin, substance P, somatostatin, and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gastrin and somatostatin were the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> most frequently identified in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, while somatostatin and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> predominated in Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, neurosecretory-type granules, 80-250 nm in diameter, were present in 2 cases; squamous features also were present in one of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient displayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178703" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertrophic osteoarthropathy</z:e>, which disappeared after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases represent the majority of the Barrett-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> in our material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to the "pure" esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> not included in this report, these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> behaved more aggressively, with wider local involvement and nodal and systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> at the time of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of multidifferentiation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> is not known nor is its possible significance, particularly with regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> arising in metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This group may merit further study to detect true differences, if any, between these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> and their apparently more common counterparts </plain></SENT>
