<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is a premalignant disease associated with oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major goal of this study was to determine the mechanism responsible for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>-induced alteration in intracellular pH (pH(i)) and its effect on DNA damage in cells derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophagus (HET1A) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (CP-A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cells were exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> cocktail (BA) and/or acid in the presence/absence of inhibitors of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) or <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-hydrogen exchanger (NHE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), pH(i) and DNA damage were measured by fluorescent imaging and comet assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of NHE1 and NOS in cultured cells and biopsies from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium was determined by RT-PCR, immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A dose dependent decrease in pH(i) was observed in CP-A cells exposed to BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect of BA is the consequence of NOS activation and increased NO production, which leads to NHE inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure of oesophageal cells to acid in combination with BA synergistically decreased pH(i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The decrease was more pronounced in CP-A cells and resulted in &gt;2-fold increase in DNA damage compared to acid treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Examination of biopsies and cell lines revealed robust expression of NHE1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> but an absence of NHE1 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study identify a new mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>-induced DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> present in the refluxate activate immediately <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three isoforms of NOS, which leads to an increased NO production and NHE inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This consequently results in increased intracellular acidification and DNA damage, which may lead to mutations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we propose that in addition to gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux, bile</z:e> reflux should be controlled in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
