<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo>, ER-B was found to be a significant predictor of response to adjuvant hormonal therapy with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine whether esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and its precursosr, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, express ER-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sections of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from 31 esophagectomy specimens were immunostained for ER-B using the immunoperoxidase technique, and the percent of positive cells in areas of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and adecocarcinoma, (CA) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear ER-B staining in &gt;50% of the cells was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 23 CA (100%), 10 out of 11 (91%) HGD, 8 out of 11 (83%) LGD and in 10 of 15 (66.6%) ND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus and most precursor lesions, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>Metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM) with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, express ER-B in a significantly high percentage of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings raise the possibility that esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> may benefit from treatment and/or chemoprevention with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50751">antiestrogens</z:chebi>, such as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
