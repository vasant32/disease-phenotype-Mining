<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine whether the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction in a well-defined population was higher than previously recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical records and original histological slides from patients residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota, were reviewed and compared with a previous study in the same population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> rose from 0.13 for 1935-1971 to 0.74 for 1974-1989, and the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagogastric junction rose from 0.25 to 1.34 per 100,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological review of preserved surgical specimens showed associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) in 2 of 2 esophageal and in 5 of 9 esophagogastric <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in each location increased five to sixfold compared with the earlier study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This increase could not be explained by improved diagnostic methods or classification changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and the parallel increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in each location is evidence that <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and of the esophagogastric junction are related disorders </plain></SENT>
