<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The restoration of squamous epithelium after photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and its related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> has been noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may result in the development of buried <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and/or BE underneath restored squamous epithelium which maintain their potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, endoscopic, and histologic characteristics and also response to further treatment of buried neoplastic epithelium developing after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two BE patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n=19), intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n=28), and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n=5) were treated with porfimer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Buried <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> completely covered by squamous epithelium were seen in 1 patient before and in 13 patients after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their prevalence was 0.6% and 7.4% of pre and post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> biopsy levels positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Buried <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, representing the highest grade of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, were noted in a series of 11 post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> endoscopies (7.1% of 155 post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> endoscopies with neoplastic diagnoses) of 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their occurrence after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was neither associated with the length of BE, the diffuseness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> nor the presence of buried lesions before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no prevalent location for these lesions in relation to the original segment of BE, although the majority of both surface and buried <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were found in the prior neoplastic sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with buried <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> responded to further treatment similarly to those with only surface <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (8 of 13 vs. 17 of 24) (P=0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, buried <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> are not uncommon after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thorough endoscopic surveillance with extensive biopsies, especially of the sites previously positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is important to avoid overlooking buried <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> that may progress </plain></SENT>
