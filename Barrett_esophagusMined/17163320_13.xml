<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: There have been no multicenter studies investigating the use of magnification chromoendoscopy (MCE) for the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to assess the ability of MCE to predict the histological diagnosis (non-biopsy detection), to compare the yield of MCE-targeted versus random biopsies for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and to compare procedure times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, patients with known or suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent MCE with indigo carmine dye staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three mucosal patterns (ridge/villous, circular, and irregular/distorted) were standardized, based on past experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mucosal patterns were noted and target biopsies were obtained only if irregular/distorted patterns were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, random four-quadrant biopsies were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 56 patients (mean age 64 years, mean length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> 2.7cm) were prospectively evaluated: 38 patients (67.8 %) had ridge/villous patterns, four patients (7.1 %) had circular patterns, four patients (7.1 %) had irregular/distorted patterns, and ten patients (17.8 %) had a combination of patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologically, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was not shown in eight patients (14.2 %), nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 30 patients (53.5 %), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was detected in 12 patients (21.4 %), and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was detected in six patients (10.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An irregular/distorted pattern either throughout the entire segment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or in combination with a ridge/villous or circular pattern had a sensitivity or 83 %, a specificity of 88 %, a positive predictive value of 45 %, and a negative predictive value of 98 % for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The yield of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was similar for the two techniques but the time taken to perform MCE was less than the time taken to perform random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An irregular/distorted pattern is specific for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and so it may not be necessary to perform biopsies in patients with ridge/villous or circular mucosal patterns </plain></SENT>
