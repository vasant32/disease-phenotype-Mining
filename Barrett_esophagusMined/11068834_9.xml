<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assesses the potential of ultraviolet-induced autofluorescence spectroscopy for early diagnosis with special focus on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Measurements were performed on 24 patients using 330 nm light excitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The determination of the spectral distribution typical of each histological tissue type was done using three fluorescence intensity ratios: RI = I390nm/I450nm; R2 = I550nm/I450nm; R3 - I390nm/I550nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The spectral distribution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa and specialized columnar Barrett's mucosa were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A strong modification of the spectral distribution was observed for high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis indicated that the spectral shape modification associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> was greater than intra- and interpatient spectral variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results allow the determination of discriminating criteria based on ratios R1 and R3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using ratio R3, the spectroscopy-based diagnosis differentiated neoplastic tissue from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa and specialized columnar Barrett's mucosa with a sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 95 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of ultraviolet autofluorescence spectroscopy should improve the diagnostic yield of standard endoscopy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
