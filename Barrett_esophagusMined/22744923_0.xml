<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is increasingly applied in daily practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Not many data are available on yearly changes in diagnostic yield, nor on changes in morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the possible changes in occurrence of abnormalities in the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive upper GI endoscopies performed over a period of 20 years were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Important diagnoses were defined as: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, metaplastic epithelium in the oesophagus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> or defective sphincter, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, erosive or nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, operated stomach, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 20-year period, 29,218 upper GI endoscopies were performed. 'Open-access' endoscopy, i.e. at the request of the general practitioner, showed a clear increase in the first ten years and remained stable thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A trend towards an increase in macroscopic abnormalities was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and defective sphincter showed a significant increase over 20 years, while the number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e> showed a less impressive, but still significant increase (p&lt;0.001) in the first ten years and remained stable thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was an impressive decrease in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> showed a gradual increase, although the numbers were very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a period of 20 years the diagnostic yield of upper GI endoscopy showed significant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reflux disease increased in prevalence while <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease decreased </plain></SENT>
