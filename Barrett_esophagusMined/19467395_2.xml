<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies using TNE are largely retrospective and deal with select patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of esophageal pathology in patients presenting with throat symptoms to an otolaryngology voice center is presently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of esophageal pathology in this population and determine the interobserver variability of the findings reviewed by an otolaryngologist and a gastroenterologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study was conducted in a laryngology/voice subspecialty clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with throat symptoms presenting to the voice center were asked prospectively to undergo TNE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings were videotaped and reviewed by an otolaryngologist and a gastroenterologist blinded to the patients' presenting complaint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>Hoarseness</z:hpo> was the most common presenting symptom (68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to the gastroenterologist, the prevalence of esophageal findings was: z-line irregularity suspicious for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (12%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (10%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (32%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percent agreement for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> study was 72 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The percent agreement for various pathological findings were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> 86 percent, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> 88 percent, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> 76 percent, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> 96 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For an abnormal study, the percent agreement was 80 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Esophageal abnormalities are common in patients presenting to a voice subspecialty clinic </plain></SENT>
