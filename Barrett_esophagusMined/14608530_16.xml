<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1-R) and c-Src are reported to be key regulators of mitogenesis and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, c-Src may exert its transforming capability by inducing increased expression of IGF1-R on the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bcl-X(L), a member of the Bcl-2 family, blocks <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and has been reported to increase in Barrett's-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To study the modifications in IGF1-R, c-Src, and Bcl-X(L) protein expression during the progression of Barrett's-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, we analyzed 34 resected gastroesophagectomy specimens by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to human IGF1-R, c-Src, and Bcl-X(L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these cases, we found 22 intestinal (Barrett's) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasias</z:mpath> (IMs), 25 low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> (LGDs), 28 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> (HGDs), 34 invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (CAs), and 19 lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High IGF1-R cytoplasmic staining was present in 14 of 19 (74%) node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, in 28 of 34 (82%) CAs, in 18 of 28 (64%) HGDs, in 13 of 25 (52%) LGDs, and in 5 of 22 (23%) IMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strong and diffuse c-Src expression was identified in 17 of 19 (89%) node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, in 29 of 34 (85%) Cas, in 26 of 28 (93%) HGDs, in 18 of 25 (72%) LGDs, and in 9 of 22 (41%) IMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bcl-X(L) cytoplasmic staining was evident in 12 of 19 (63%) node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, in 20 of 34 (59%) Cas, in 20 of 28 (71%) HGDs, in 15 of 25 (60%) LGDs, and in 6 of 22 (27%) IMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 11 cases, c-Src activity was measured by kinase assay and reflected the immunohistochemical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that expression levels of IGF1-R, c-Src, and Bcl-X(L) proteins are coordinately elevated in Barrett's-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate important roles of these growth regulatory proteins in the malignant progression of Barrett's-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
