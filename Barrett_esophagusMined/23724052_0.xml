<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) is characterized by a steep rise in incidence rates in the Western population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The unique miRNA signature that distinguishes EAC from other upper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we performed a comprehensive microarray profiling for the specific miRNA signature associated with EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We validated this signature by qRT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microarray analysis showed that 21 miRNAs were consistently deregulated in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>miR-194, miR-192, miR-200a, miR-21, miR-203, miR-205, miR-133b, and miR-31 were selected for validation using 46 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous (NS), 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), 17 Barrett's high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), 34 EAC, 33 <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (GC), and 45 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric (NG) tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The qRT-PCR analysis indicated that 2 miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-133b) were deregulated in both EAC and GC, and 6 miRNAs (up-regulated: miR-194, miR-31, miR-192, and miR-200a; down-regulated: miR-203 and miR-205) in EAC, as compared to BE but not in GC, indicating their potential unique role in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that miR-194, miR-192, miR-21, and miR-31 were up-regulated in BE adjacent to HGD lesions relative to isolated BE samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of clinicopathological features indicated that down-regulation of miR-203 is significantly associated with progression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stages in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the overexpression levels of miR-194, miR-200a, and miR-192 were significantly higher in early EAC stages, suggesting that these miRNAs may be involved in EAC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development rather than progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the presence of a unique miRNA signature for EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may provide some clues for the distinct molecular features of EAC to be considered in future studies of the role of miRNAs in EAC and their utility as disease biomarkers </plain></SENT>
