<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) and narrow-band imaging (NBI) may be useful techniques to complement HRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare HRE-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> with HRE-NBI for the detection of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (HGD/EC) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent HRE-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> and HRE-NBI (separated by 6 - 8 weeks) in a randomized sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two procedures were performed by two different endoscopists, who were blinded to the findings of the other examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Targeted biopsies were taken from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> detected lesions, followed by four-quadrant biopsies at 2-cm intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsy evaluation was supervised by a single expert pathologist, who was blinded to the imaging technique used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients were diagnosed with HGD/EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for HGD/EC was 93 % and 86 % for HRE-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> and HRE-NBI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Targeted biopsies had a sensitivity of 79 % with HRE alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HGD was diagnosed from random biopsies alone in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> and NBI detected a limited number of additional lesions occult to HRE, but these lesions did not alter the sensitivity for identifying patients with HGD/EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In most patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, subtle lesions can be identified with high-resolution endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Indigo carmine chromoendoscopy and narrow-band imaging are comparable as adjuncts to high-resolution endoscopy </plain></SENT>
