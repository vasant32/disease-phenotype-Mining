<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The development of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is generally closely associated with the presence of a specialised intestinal-type epithelium such as that found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A particular histological condition is when the distal oesophagus showing cardiac and/or fundic mucosa without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> cannot be defined as 'Barrett's mucosa' [condition that we call '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined oesophagus</z:e>' (CLO)] and up till now, there has been no agreement in literature about the management of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aurora-A overexpression leads to centrosome amplification, <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out on 28 consecutive patients who presented columnar mucosa above the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As controls, two more biopsies were obtained, one on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing squamous oesophagus above the GOJ, as far as possible from the columnar mucosa (controls A), and one taken 1 cm below the GOJ (controls B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Aurora-A and p53 expression levels were analysed respectively by Quantitative Real Time PCR and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients were affected by BO (43%) while the other 16 patients (57%) had a CLO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine of 28 (32%) cases were focally positive for p53 immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the BO/CLO samples were positive for the Aurora-A transcript with regard to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 13 of 28 (46%) cases showed overexpression (above the median for the whole group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to the low number of cases, we are not at present able to state that statistically significant quantitative differences in Aurora-A <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression exist between CLO and BO cases with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and p53-positive immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies on a larger number of cases with a follow-up period are necessary in order to establish the risk of progression and the correct management of these subjects </plain></SENT>
