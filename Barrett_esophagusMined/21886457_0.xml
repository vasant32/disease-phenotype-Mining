<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This review covers the development of angle-resolved low coherence interferometry (a/LCI) from initial development through clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first applications, the approach used a time-domain interferometry scheme and was validated using animal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> to assess the feasibility of detecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further development of the approach led to Fourier-domain interferometry schemes with higher throughput and endoscope-compatible probes to enable clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These later implementations have been applied to clinical studies of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> tissues, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_605'>metaplastic tissue</z:mpath> type that is associated with an increased risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As an alternative to systematic biopsy, the a/LCI approach offers high sensitivity and specificity for detecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in these tissues while avoiding the need for tissue removal or exogenous contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, the various implementations of a/LCI are discussed and the results of the preliminary animal experiments and ex vivo human tissue studies are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A review of a recent in vivo clinical study is also presented </plain></SENT>
