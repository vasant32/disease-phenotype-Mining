<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The specialized columnar epithelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> can be detected by obtaining random or 4 quadrant biopsy specimens at conventional endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the fine mucosal structure of specialized columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were studied by magnifying endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fine mucosal pattern (pit pattern) of 67 regions in Barrett's mucosa was recorded and compared with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologic, mucin immunohistologic, and cell proliferation analyses of biopsy specimens were performed in relation to the pit patterns determined by magnifying endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pit pattern was classified into 5 types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tubular and villous pit patterns were not only characteristics of both specialized columnar epithelium and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> absorption, but also possessed an intestinal mucin phenotype with a high Ki-labeling index, whereas other pit patterns (dot and straight) did not have specialized columnar epithelium and were categorized as the gastric phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The long oval pit pattern had an intermediate phenotype between gastric and intestinal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The classification of the superficial mucosal appearance of Barrett's epithelium by magnifying endoscopy reflects not only histologic features but also mucin phenotypes </plain></SENT>
