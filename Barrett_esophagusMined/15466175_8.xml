<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, methylation of the APC promoter was analyzed in histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing gastric mucosa samples by methylation-sensitive single-strand conformation analysis and by a methylation-sensitive dot blot assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epithelial cell samples were collected by microdissection from tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Equal amounts of methylated and unmethylated APC alleles were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gastric mucosa samples from patients without any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric lesions</z:e> (20 samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allele-specific methylation analysis showed that the methylation of the APC promoter was monoallelic; however, which allele was methylated depended on the cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased or decreased methylation was found in 10 of 36 (28%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa samples adjacent to a gastric or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No allelic loss was found at the APC locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Modification of the methylation status was also found in 3 of 21 (14%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing gastric mucosa samples adjacent to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa samples in cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005231'>chronic gastritis</z:hpo> but without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed a monoallelic methylation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate the following: (a) In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa, the APC promoter shows monoallelic methylation, which is not due to imprinting but most likely due to allelic exclusion; (b) the excluded allele differs between foveolar and glandular epithelial cells; (c) the APC methylation pattern is frequently altered in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing gastric mucosa of gastric or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients; and (d) such alterations also occur in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa adjacent to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
