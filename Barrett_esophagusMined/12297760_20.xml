<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability of transnasal upper endoscopy to detect Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or dysplastic change has not been systematically evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of transnasal upper endoscopy for surveillance of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and to evaluate its histopathologic yield for Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were evaluated with conventional upper endoscopy and transnasal upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An effort was made to recruit patients known to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quadrantic biopsy specimens were taken with standard (conventional upper endoscopy) and pediatric (transnasal upper endoscopy) biopsy forceps at procedures performed at least 1 week apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two blinded pathologists evaluated the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transnasal upper endoscopy detected Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> histopathologically in 31 of 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Level of agreement for presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in biopsy specimens obtained between conventional upper endoscopy and transnasal upper endoscopy was excellent (k = 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in specimens obtained by conventional upper endoscopy (k = 0.61) and by transnasal upper endoscopy (k = 0.61) were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraobserver agreement between conventional upper endoscopy and transnasal upper endoscopy biopsy specimens for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by pathologist 1 (k = 0.73) and pathologist 2 (k = 0.75) were also similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant adverse effects were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transnasal upper endoscopy is feasible and accurate for identification and histopathologic confirmation of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> with a histopathologic yield for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> comparable with conventional upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
