<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In a minority of patients undergoing antireflux surgery, an esophageal lengthening procedure is required to reduce the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) below the esophageal hiatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated risk factors associated with an irreducible GEJ to identify clinical features that were predictive of the need for a Collis gastroplasty in patients undergoing laparoscopic antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who required a Collis gastroplasty during a laparoscopic antireflux procedure (defined as the inability to reduce the GEJ &gt; 2.5 cm below the esophageal hiatus despite extensive mobilization of the mediastinal esophagus) were compared to a random sample of patients who did not have a Collis gastroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictors of the need for an esophageal lengthening procedure were identified using logistic regression modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risks were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients who had a Collis gastroplasty were compared to 133 patients who had adequate esophageal length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of a stricture (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.0, 9.7), paraesophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.3, 9.6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.3, 10.7), and re-do antireflux surgery (OR 6.4; 95% CI 2.0, 20.7) were associated with the need for gastroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with none of these factors were extremely unlikely to require a gastroplasty (OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.02, 0.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing laparoscopic antireflux surgery who are at high risk of needing an esophageal lengthening procedure can be easily identified preoperatively using simple clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
