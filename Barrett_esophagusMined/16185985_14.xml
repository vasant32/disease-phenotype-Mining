<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and localized <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> but are either unfit for major surgery or decline esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy with the powerful photosensitizer m-tetrahydroxyphenyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36303">chlorin</z:chebi> may be a nonsurgical therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and complications of m-tetrahydroxyphenyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36303">chlorin</z:chebi> photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The design is a case series of 19 consecutive patients at a tertiary referral unit with a special interest in photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study included 7 patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 12 with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, who had refused or were unfit for esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">photosensitization</z:e> with 0.15 mg/kg m-tetrahydroxyphenyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36303">chlorin</z:chebi>, red or green light was delivered endoscopically when using either a bare fiber or a diffuser device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were assessed by endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By using red light via the diffuser, 4/6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and 3/4 with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were successfully treated with photodynamic therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When using the bare-tipped fiber, there was one procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and only 1/5 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were successfully treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two others were downgraded to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With green light delivered via a diffuser, 0/3 patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> are in long-term remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two serious complications arose (including one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) from taking multiple biopsy specimens too soon after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy with m-tetrahydroxyphenyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36303">chlorin</z:chebi> is, potentially, a valuable therapeutic option for localized esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Red light via a diffuser device appears to be the most effective light-delivery technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens should not be taken for at least 2 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
