<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Excess body mass is associated with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e>, and cross-sectional studies suggest an association between body mass index (BMI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study sought prospectively to examine the influence of BMI and other anthropomorphic measures on the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective study of 15 861 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for any reason between 1986 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were 261 cases of pathologically confirmed specialised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> within the oesophagus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Self-reported data on weight were collected from biennial questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Self-reported height was collected in 1976, and self-reported waist and hip circumferences were collected in 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with women with a BMI of 20-24.9 kg/m(2), women with a BMI of 25-29.9 had a multivariate OR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> of 0.92 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.27), women with a BMI &gt; or =30 had a multivariate OR of 1.52 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.28) and women with a BMI &lt;20 had a multivariate OR of 0.92 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were similar when controlling for symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e>, and among the entire Nurses' Health Study cohort (n = 93 609) regardless of a history of endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference and height did not appear to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp>, but not overweight, women appear to be at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
