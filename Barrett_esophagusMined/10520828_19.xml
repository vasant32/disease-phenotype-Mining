<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Postoperative morbidity after correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> is partly determined by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, which has been proven to affect from one-half to two-thirds of patients during childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a follow-up study to test our hypothesis that, if former patients still show <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> at adult age, they are at high risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, which is considered to be premalignant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 69 patients born between 1971 and 1978, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> having undergone a primary anastomosis, 24 had died, five of them because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 45 survivors, 39 could be traced; they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> completed a questionnaire inquiring after symptoms related to the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 34 underwent an additional esophagogastrocopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only nine of the 39 patients had no symptoms at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>; 30 had mild to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> symptoms, and 13 had mild to severe reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Esophagogastrocopy in 34 patients revealed that the anastomosis was still recognizable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, but stenoses were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients showed a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and one a large one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidences of reflux symptoms (13/39, p &lt; 0.01), reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (9/34, p &lt; 0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (2/34, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This group seems to be at risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As this is the first follow-up study of a consecutive group of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> patients, we think it is advisable to perform an esophagogastroscopy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at adulthood until more long term follow-up data are available </plain></SENT>
