<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) is a lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> that can develop from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, there are no validated simple methods to predict which patients will progress to EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the genetic mechanisms driving EAC <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> is needed to identify new therapeutic targets and develop biomarkers capable of identifying high-risk patients that would benefit from aggressive neoadjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We employed an integrative genomics approach to identify novel genes involved in EAC biology that may serve as useful clinical markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Whole genome tiling-path array comparative genomic hybridization was used to identify significant regions of copy number alteration in 20 EACs and 10 matching BE tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Copy number and gene expression data were integrated to identify candidate oncogenes within regions of amplification and multiple additional sample cohorts were assessed to validate candidate genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified RFC3 as a novel, candidate oncogene activated by amplification in approximately 25% of EAC samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RFC3 was also amplified in BE from a patient whose EAC harbored amplification and was differentially expressed between nonmalignant and EAC tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Copy number gains were detected in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types and RFC3 knockdown inhibited proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells with increased copy number but had little effect on those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, high RFC3 expression was associated with poor patient outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RFC3 is a candidate oncogene amplified in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RFC3 DNA amplification is also prevalent in other epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types and RFC3 expression could serve as a prognostic marker </plain></SENT>
