<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was to detect expressions of EGFR and E-cadherin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo>, and to analyze their relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expressions of EGFR and E-cadherin in 50 specimens of esophageal squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and 8 specimens of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive rates of EGFR, and E-cadherin in esophageal squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were 72.0% (36/50), and 22.0% (11/50); while those in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were 75.0% (6/8), and 25% (2/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive rates of EGFR in esophageal squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of grades I, II, and III were 63.6%, 75.0%, and 81.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of EGFR negatively correlated with that of E-cadherin (r=-0.341, P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of EGFR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> is increased, while that of E-cadherin is decreased;down-regulation of E-cadherin may be associated with up-regulation of EGFR </plain></SENT>
