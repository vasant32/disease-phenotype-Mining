<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY AIM: The aim of this retrospective study was to report a series of 28 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (ADK) arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), treated by esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1992 to 1998, 28 patients were operated on for ADK in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 27 men and one woman (mean age: 65 years) classified as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> I (n = 2), <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> II (n = 15) and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> III (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had a long story of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux disease</z:e> which required surgical repair in five of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> was the main symptom (n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical procedures included 15 Ivor Lewis operations, nine esophagectomies without thoracotomy and four esophagogastrectomies by the left thoracic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pathological examination of the specimens showed an EBO with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 27) and a high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among five patients with a previously known BE, three under endoscopic surveillance had high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 1) and limited T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (n = 2), while the other two patients without surveillance developed an invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (T3N1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were three postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (mortality rate: 10%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> arising from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948755" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary failure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 16.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients resumed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rates were 63%, 42% and 15.2% respectively at 1, 2 and 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis could identify 3 prognostic factors: <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score previously known BE under surveillance, length of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in BE is very often diagnosed too late </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with high risk BE require an endoscopic survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>High grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detected in two successive examinations by two different pathologists may require prophylactic esophagectomy, but local endoscopic management presently under evaluation could be efficient in the future </plain></SENT>
