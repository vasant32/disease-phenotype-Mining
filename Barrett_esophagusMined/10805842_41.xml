<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The diagnostic yield and cost of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveillance in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> using <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi>-directed biopsies (MBDB) were compared with surveillance using a "jumbo" random biopsy technique in a prospective, sequential, controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed with either MBDB or random biopsy in a randomized sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportions of various types of epithelia in each biopsy were estimated and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was graded in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-three patients with short- (n = 8), limited- (n = 10), and long-segment (n = 25) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using MBDB technique, the average number of biopsies obtained per patient was significantly lower and the proportion of specialized columnar epithelium in each specimen was significantly higher compared with random biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was diagnosed in significantly more MBDB specimens (12% vs. 6%, p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite fewer biopsies per patient using MBDB, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was diagnosed in significantly more patients (44% vs. 28%, p = 0.03) than by random biopsy technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MBDB cost less and detected more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> than random biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MBDB is a more accurate and cost-effective technique than random biopsy for diagnosing specialized columnar epithelium and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, particularly in long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
