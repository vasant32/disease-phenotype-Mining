<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acid suppressive drugs are widely used for symptomatic therapy of reflux disease but may induce hypersecretion of gastrin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amidated gastrin (G-17) has been shown to be a growth factor for OAC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have examined the effects of glycine-extended gastrin (G-Gly), an alternative product of progastrin processing on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the QhERT Barrett's oesophageal cell line and OE33 and BIC-1 OAC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>G-Gly inhibited serum-starvation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27656">camptothecin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lines, G-17 was only effective in OE33 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast to the effects of G-17, the anti-apoptotic effect of G-Gly was independent of both the CCK(2) receptor and cyclo-oxygenase-2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G-Gly stimulated JAK2 phosphorylation and kinase activity and JAK2-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>G-Gly also increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and BCL2L1 but did not affect the levels of BAD, BAX or BCL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Novel small molecule inhibitors of JAK2 and STAT3 as well as STAT3 siRNA blocked the anti-apoptotic effects of G-Gly and inhibited the induction of survivin and BCL2L1 in OE33 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that G-Gly inhibits <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in BO and OAC via mechanisms distinct from those activated by G-17 and involving JAK2 and STAT3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Release of gastrin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in response to acid suppressive therapy may adversely influence the dynamics of the epithelium in BO </plain></SENT>
