<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Familial aggregation of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, esophagogastric junction <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, and their precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has been termed familial BE (FBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies documenting increased familial risk for these diseases raise the hypothesis that there may be an inherited susceptibility to the development of BE and its associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, using segregation analysis for a binary trait as implemented in S.A.G.E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>6.0.1, we analyzed data on 881 singly ascertained pedigrees to determine whether FBE is caused by a common environmental or genetic agent and, if genetic, to identify the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> of FBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> models were compared by likelihood ratio tests and Akaike's A Information Criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that random environmental and/or multifactorial components were insufficient to fully explain the familial nature of FBE, but rather, there is segregation of a major type transmitted from one generation to the next (P &lt; 10(-10)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An incompletely dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> model together with a polygenic component fits the data best </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For this dominant model, the estimated penetrance of the dominant allele is 0.1005 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.0587-0.1667] and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> rate is 0.0012 (95% CI, 0.0004-0.0042), corresponding to a relative risk of 82.53 (95% CI, 28.70-237.35) or odds ratio of 91.63 (95% CI, 32.01-262.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This segregation analysis provides epidemiologic evidence in support of one or more rare autosomally inherited dominant susceptibility allele(s) in FBE families and, hence, motivates linkage analyses </plain></SENT>
