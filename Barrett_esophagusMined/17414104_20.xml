<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal esophagus and gastric cardia are defined by the relationship of its epicenter to the gastro-esophageal junction, which is presently defined as the end of the tubular esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently suggested that the true gastro-esophageal junction is best defined by the proximal limit of gastric oxyntic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To reclassify <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of this region by the relationship of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> to the proximal limit of gastric oxyntic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-four patients who had esophago-gastrectomy for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in this region were classified as <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of distal esophagus (38 patients) and gastric cardia (36 patients) by present criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The epithelial type at the epicenter and distal edge of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The epicenter of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in 64 patients with noncircumferential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had squamous (5 cases), cardiac (21 cases), oxynto-cardiac (4 cases), and intestinal (Barrett-type) (34 cases) epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None had gastric oxyntic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 patients with circumferential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 7 had cardiac or oxynto-cardiac epithelium at the distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> edge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: If the gastro-esophageal junction is defined histologically as the proximal limit of oxyntic mucosa, 71/74 patients would be classified as <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other 3 patients were questionable as to gastric or esophageal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this reclassification based on the proposed new definition of the gastro-esophageal junction provides an explanation for the epidemiologic relationship that exists between <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the "gastric cardia" and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
