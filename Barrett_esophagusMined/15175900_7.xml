<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relation between mature and immature vessels as a prognostic factor for Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> has not been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specimens from 45 R0-resected Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were immunostained for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD 31, and smooth muscle alpha-actin to discriminate between mature and immature vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VEGF staining was evaluated quantitatively by measuring optical density with a new computer-based program and expressed as a percentage of the staining (juvenile placental tissue) on control slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neovascularization coefficient (i.e., the relation between mature and immature vessels) was estimated with an interactive analytic computer program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival of the study group was 45.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neovascularization coefficient correlated with the histopathologic classification ( p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
