<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The usual surgical treatment for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a classic Nissen fundoplication or posterior gastropexy with cardial calibration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some surgical reports as well as our experience suggest that the rate of failure of the Nissen fundoplication or Hill's posterior gastropexy in patients with BE is significantly higher than in those with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> without BE, probably due in part to the persistence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e> into the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the late subjective and objective results of an operation consisting in "acid suppression" (vagotomy-partial gastrectomy) and "duodenal diversion" (Roux-en-Y anastomosis) as a primary surgical procedure for patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 210 patients were subjected to this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It consisted in a primary operation in 142 patients and revision surgery in 68 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They underwent complete clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, histologic, and manometric studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some cases 24-hour pH studies, Bilitec studies, gastric emptying, and gastric acid secretion evaluations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0.95%), and postoperative morbidity was low (5.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The late mean follow-up (58 months) for 146 patients who completed a follow-up longer than 24 months showed Visick I and II grades in 91.1% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 14.9% of the cases 24-hour pH monitoring showed excessive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> 1 year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has appeared up to now </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Functional studies showed significant alleviation of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) incompetence, with abolition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e> into the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Gastric emptying of solids was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and basal and peak gastric acid output remained at a low level 8 to 10 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with BE, with severe damage of the LES and esophageal peristalsis, the "suppression diversion" operation completely abolishes the reflux of injurious components of the refluxate and improves sphincter competence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This effect is permanent and avoids the appearance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
