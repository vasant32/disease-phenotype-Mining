<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Today patients are encouraged to be actively involved in the treatment decision-making process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To do this they must receive adequate information and, more importantly, understand it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with Barrett's, this information is often given to the patient immediately following an endoscopy, when patients find it difficult to absorb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Internet can provide patients with up-to-the-minute information that they can digest in their own time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the current information given to patients and their views on using the Internet for these purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A postal questionnaire was devised, and sent to the 267 patients with Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire sought to determine the source and quality of current patient information, and patients' willingness to use the Internet for medical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred and ninety-five (73%) questionnaires were returned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fifty-three patients (78.5%) of those who responded stated they wanted more information about their condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight patients (33.8%) had Internet access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One hundred and five (53.8%) patients stated that they would use an Internet site if access were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The average age of this group was 58.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine (40.5%) stated they would not use an Internet site; their average age was 69.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Current patient information is often inadequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A significant proportion of the patients would use the Internet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Those who had already used the Internet to access information found existing sites to be very 'American', and presented in a way that made them difficult for a layperson to understand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is essential that patients have adequate information in a format they can access and understand </plain></SENT>
