<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The histological distinction between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> involving the distal esophagus (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> [BE]) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the stomach has important clinical implications and can be difficult even with the use of histochemical mucin stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytokeratin (CK) 7 and 20 are cytoplasmic structural proteins that show restricted expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the use of CK7 and 20 expression in the histological distinction of BE from gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CK7 and 20 immunostaining was performed on randomly selected surgical resection (n = 31) and biopsy specimens (n = 34) from patients with long-segment BE and gastric resection specimens (n = 11) and gastric cardia biopsy specimens (n = 13) in patients with histological evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A unique pattern of immunoreactivity designated the Barrett's CK7/20 pattern showed superficial CK20 staining and strong CK7 staining of both superficial and deep glands in 29 of 31 (94%) esophageal resection specimens and 34 of 34 (100%) esophageal biopsy specimens form patients with long-segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Barrett's CK7/20 pattern was not observed in gastric cardia biopsy specimens (n = 13) or gastric resection specimens (n = 11) in patients with histological evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of a Barrett's CK7/20 pattern for a diagnosis of long-segment BE was 97%, 100%, and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CK7 and 20 reactivity patterns can reliably identify the location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the esophagus and stomach using histological material from both routine endoscopic biopsy and surgical resection specimens </plain></SENT>
