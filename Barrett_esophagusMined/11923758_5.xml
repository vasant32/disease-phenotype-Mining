<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Esophagoscopy with a portable battery-powered endoscope could provide a safe, inexpensive, and minimally invasive way to screen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of such an instrument in an unsedated fashion has not been previously evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients referred for an EGD were recruited to undergo an additional examination with the battery-powered endoscope before EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In phase 1, (n = 42) patients received conscious sedation before the battery-powered endoscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In phase 2, (n = 56) patients were not sedated and were given the option of a peroral (n = 43) or transnasal (n = 13) endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examiners were blinded to patient history and procedure indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Esophageal findings, ease of intubation, optical quality, and patient comfort for the battery-powered endoscope and standard EGD were recorded by the endoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (60 men, 38 women, mean age 53 years) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumors</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> was 54.5%, 66.7%, and 80%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ease of intubation and patient comfort as perceived by the endoscopist were not significantly different between the battery-powered endoscope and EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Optical quality was ranked as less than 4 (on a 5-point scale with 5 = standard EGD and 1 = poor) in 42% of battery-powered endoscopic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The accuracy of esophageal examination with a 3.1-mm endoscope is substantially inferior to standard EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, the battery-powered endoscope would not be useful for screening patients for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> unless improvements in optical quality and visualization are made </plain></SENT>
