<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thermoablation is being used to eliminate the metaplastic epithelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and allow its reversal into squamous epithelium in an acid-controlled environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a new thermoablation technique, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with circumferential <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> 2 to 5 cm long were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acid suppression was accomplished with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-half the circumference of Barrett's mucosa was treated with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation, and the other half served as an internal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After macroscopic squamous re-epithelialization occurred, biopsy specimens were obtained from both areas systematically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men with a mean age of 51.1 years, completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring a pH less than 4 occurred on average 2.8% of the time with a mean dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> of 70 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Squamous re-epithelialization developed in treated areas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biopsy showed that 7 of 9 patients (77.8%) had squamous re-epithelialization without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Biopsy showed that 2 of 9 patients (22.2%) had squamous re-epithelialization with evidence of underlying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation in an acid-controlled environment was both efficacious and safe in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the reappearance of squamous epithelium after therapy did not exclude the presence of underlying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
