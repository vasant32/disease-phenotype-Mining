<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cancerous cells with altered glycosylation of their surface proteins shed such proteins into the circulating fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Glycomic profiling of such fluids shows the altered glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed glycomic profiling of serum from patients with no known disease, Barrett's without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in an attempt to delineate distinct differences in glycosylation among these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples from patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (N = 5), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (N = 11), and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (N = 50) were collected; samples from 18 healthy volunteers were used as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> were enzymatically released and then applied to both C18 Sep-Pak (Waters, Milford, MA) cartridges and activated charcoal cartridges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> were permethylated and then spotted directly onto a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mass spectra were acquired using the Applied Biosystems 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc, Framingham, Mass) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The obtained matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry data were processed using DataExplorer files (Applied Biosystems Inc) <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> m/z values and intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intensities of 98 glycans were significantly different among the 3 groups; 26 of these corresponded to known glycan structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pairwise comparisons showed that 8 glycans were significantly different in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 pairwise comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that comparative glycomic profiling of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> reveals a subset of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> that can be selected as candidate biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These markers can differentiate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> from high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further validation will be necessary to determine the clinical utility of these glycan biomarkers </plain></SENT>
