<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the safety and efficacy of RFA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> delivered in a community practice setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter registry conducted in community-based gastroenterology practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had confirmed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervention was step-wise RFA with follow-up esophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endpoints were histology-based; complete response was defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsies at most recent endoscopy negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CR-IM) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (CR-D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three cohorts were reported: 1) safety cohort, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; 2) efficacy cohort A, patients with at least one biopsy session after initial treatment; 3) efficacy cohort B, patients with at least one biopsy session &gt; or = 1 year after initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The safety cohort included 429 patients (71 % men, median age 59 years, median Barrett's segment 3.0 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no serious adverse events (<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>), and a stricture occurred after 1.1 % of cases (2.1 % of patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In efficacy cohort A (n = 338), CR-IM and CR-D were achieved in 72 % and 89 % of patients, respectively (median follow-up 9 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In efficacy cohort B (n = 137), CR-IM and CR-D were achieved in 77 % and 100 % of patients, respectively (median follow-up 20 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter registry conducted at four community-based practices, the observed safety and efficacy outcomes associated with RFA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are comparable to those previously reported in multicenter trials from predominantly tertiary academic centers </plain></SENT>
