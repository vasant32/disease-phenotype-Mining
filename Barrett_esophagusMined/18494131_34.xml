<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the efficacy and safety of ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> after prior endoscopic resection for visible lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> visible abnormalities were resected prior to ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persistence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> was confirmed with biopsies after endoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A balloon-based electrode was used for primary circumferential ablation and an endoscope-mounted electrode was used for secondary focal ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was the main outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients (eight men; median age 60 years) were treated (median Barrett's length 5 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Visible abnormalities were removed with endoscopic resection in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The worst pathological grade of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> after endoscopic resection and prior to ablation was LGD (n = 2) and HGD (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a median of two circumferential and two focal ablation sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete remission of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and complete endoscopic and histological removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was achieved in 11/11 patients (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no adverse events or strictures, and in none of the 473 biopsies of neo-squamous mucosa was subsquamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> ("buried Barrett's") observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up period of 14 months after the last treatment session and a median number of two follow-up endoscopies, none of the patients showed recurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or endoscopic signs of recurrent Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stepwise circumferential and focal ablation appears to be a safe and effective treatment for complete removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> containing HGD, and can be safely performed after prior endoscopic resection for endoscopically visible abnormalities </plain></SENT>
