<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken (1) to investigate the gene and protein expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), interleukin-8 (IL-8), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), gastrin, and its receptor (CCK-2) in the Barrett's epithelium; (2) to analyze the activity of NFkappaB in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; and (3) to assess the effects of PPARgamma ligand (ciglitazone) and gastrin on cell proliferation in the cell line derived from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OE-33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>COX-2, PPARgamma, IL-8, HGF, gastrin, and CCK-2 expression levels relative to the control gene encoding GAPDH were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blot in specimens of BE with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 20) and compared with that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal mucosa from the middle portion of the esophagus (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments included the incubation of cell line OE-33 with ciglitazone (1-15 microM) and gastrin (100 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NFkappaB activity in biopsies specimens was measured by highly sensitive ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>COX-2, PPARgamma, IL-8, HGF, gastrin, and CCK-2 expressions were significantly increased in BE compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NFkappaB activity was significantly upregulated in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ciglitazone inhibited cell proliferation of OE-33 cells as assessed by BrdU and this effect was attenuated partly by gastrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(1) COX-2, PPARgamma, HGF, gastrin, and its receptor are significantly upregulated in BE, suggesting a possible role for these factors in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>; (2) the increased NFkappaB activity is probably linked to increased IL-8 and COX-2 expression; and (3) PPARgamma ligands might be useful as a new therapeutic option in the prevention and treatment of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
