<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a balloon catheter, which expands the esophagus and centers the catheter, applies direct pressure on the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This may affect the tissue appearance and the ability to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study this effect, we propose a double-balloon catheter to allow imaging with and without balloon-tissue contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A system design based on a spectral-domain OCT platform is reported and validated by acquisition of high quality, volumetric images of swine esophagus in vivo </plain></SENT>
