<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> occurs during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> but has never been studied in BE or EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied high-resolution methylome analysis to identify changes at genomic regions that encode noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> in BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed methylation of 1.8 million CpG sites using massively parallel sequencing-based HELP tagging in matched EAC, BE, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed human EAC (OE33, SKGT4, and FLO-1) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (HEEpic) esophageal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE and EAC exhibited genome-wide hypomethylation, significantly affecting intragenic and repetitive genomic elements as well as noncoding regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These methylation changes targeted small and long noncoding regions, discriminating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> from matched BE or EAC tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One long noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, AFAP1-AS1, was extremely hypomethylated and overexpressed in BE and EAC tissues and EAC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its silencing by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> inhibited proliferation and colony-forming ability, induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and reduced EAC cell migration and invasion without altering the expression of its protein-coding counterpart, AFAP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BE and EAC exhibit reduced methylation that includes noncoding regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Methylation of the long noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> AFAP1-AS1 is reduced in BE and EAC, and its expression inhibits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related biologic functions of EAC cells </plain></SENT>
