<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pharmacodynamic data show <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> can achieve optimal acid suppression since the first administration and can maintain this advantage in the following days of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> has the highest pKa (~ 5.0, the pH at which a drug becomes 50% protonated), and hence the molecule can be activated at higher pH levels much faster than other <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to its peculiar catabolic pathway, ie, a prevalent metabolism through a non-enzymatic pathway, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> is less susceptible to the influence of genetic polymorphisms for CYP2C19, resulting in minor influences on its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In terms of clinical efficacy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> 20 mg uid or 10 mg bid produced healing rates at 8 weeks similar to those obtained with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 20 mg uid in erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients, and in NERD patients doses of 10 or 20 mg are equivalent and both are better than placebo at 2 and 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To prevent symptomatic relapse, on-demand strategy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> 10 mg daily appears to be ideal, due to its rapidity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; results on NERD patients have documented its superiority over placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continuous treatment, however, up to 5 years, seems to achieve better results than on-demand therapy, particularly in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is debated whether in the latter halved doses (10 mg) are really equivalent to full dose (20 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">Rabeprazole</z:chebi> has been used with success in the treatment of some atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> manifestations, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest-pain</z:hpo>, and in the therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> achieves similar Helicobacter pylori eradication rates compared with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> when co-administrated with low or high doses of antibiotics (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2676">amoxicillin</z:chebi> and clarithromycin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, low doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> (10 mg/bid) may be effective in eradicating the pathogen </plain></SENT>
