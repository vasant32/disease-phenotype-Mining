<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An accurate assessment of this technique requires the evaluation of biopsies before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, despite the importance of pathology, only a limited number of studies have systematically assessed the mucosal changes after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate mucosal changes after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, and pathologic variables that may impact on the success of this therapy, we analyzed the pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> biopsies of a cohort of patients treated by this modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients (mean age, 71 years) with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and/or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IMC) arising in BE and followed up after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> using Porfimer <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> form the basis of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, a review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> biopsies was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variables recorded included the histologic grade and architecture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and squamous re-epithelialization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IMC and HGD coexisted in the pre-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> biopsies of 18 patients (54.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMC and HGD showed a prominent tubular proliferation in 14 patients and displayed a papillary pattern (at least partially) in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, patches of specialized columnar epithelium were buried under squamous epithelium in 17 patients (51.5%), and foci of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> covered by squamous epithelium were found in 9 patients (27.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HGD and/or IMC were eradicated in 17 patients (eradicated group) and persisted in 16 patients (persistent group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the persistent group, grade and architecture were unchanged after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in 62.5% and 87.5% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The persistent group was characterized by: 1) a more frequent papillary architecture (P &lt; 0.05), and 2) a diffuse distribution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> on pre-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> biopsies (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Singularly, the persistent neoplastic lesions were observed in the distal esophagus (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A systematic histopathologic evaluation allowed us to draw attention to the fact that distally located and papillary-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> seem resistant to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The higher than expected incidence of buried residual neoplastic epithelium should also be emphasized since it represents a risk for undetected growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
