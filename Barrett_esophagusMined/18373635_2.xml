<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the medical resource utilization in the 3 years before OAC diagnosis as potential markers for early identification and intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 65 incident OAC within the Integrated Primary Care Information database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we randomly selected 260 age- and gender-matched population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We abstracted the use of gastric acid inhibitors, general practitioner (GP) and specialist care, and gastroscopies in the 3 years before the detection of OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 20% of the cases used gastric acid inhibitors in the third and second year before OAC, which increased to almost 50% in the last year, compared to approximately 10% among controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only in the 6 months before OAC, the proportion of patients visiting a GP (97%) or specialist (41%) increased compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 13 gastroscopies performed in the 3 years, six (46%) were not suspect for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Only a minority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> OAC patients used acid inhibitors before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of medical care between cases and controls differed only in the final year before OAC diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Detection of early neoplastic changes proves to be difficult </plain></SENT>
