<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the risk of progression to HGD or EAC in patients with NDBE, based on segment length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from large cohort of patients participating in the BE Study-a multicenter outcomes project comprising 5 US tertiary care referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologic changes were graded as low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), HGD, or EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study included patients with BE of documented length without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and at least 1 y of follow up (n=1175, 88% male) and excluded patients who developed HGD or EAC within 1 y of diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 5.5 y (6463 patient-y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Annual risk of HGD and EAC was plotted in 3 cm increments (≤3 cm, 4-6 cm, 7-9 cm, 10-12 cm, and ≥13 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We calculated the association between time to progression and length of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean length of BE length was 3.6 cm; 44 patients developed HGD or EAC, with an annual incidence rate of 0.67%/y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to non-progressors, patients who developed HGD or EAC had longer BE (6.1 vs 3.5 cm; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed a 28% increase in risk of HGD or EAC for every 1 cm increase in BE length (P=.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE segment lengths ≤3 cm took longer to develop HGD or EAC than those with lengths &gt;4 cm (6 y vs 4 y; P= non-significant) CONCLUSION: In patients with BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, length of BE is associated with progression to HGD or EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results support for development of risk stratification scheme for these patients based on length of BE segment </plain></SENT>
