<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 patients with BE (mean age 58 years) underwent endoscopic laser therapy: 11 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, 2 with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 2 with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean length of BE was 4 cm (range 1-12 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of these patients also underwent antireflux surgery, and nine were prescribed acid-suppressive medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic Nd:YAG laser treatment was carried out from 1997 to 1999; thereafter, diode laser was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up of these patients after the first laser session was 28 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a mean of 6.5 laser sessions (range 3-17 sessions), with no apparent complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean energy per session was 1705 JJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only six of these patients (40%) showed complete endoscopic and histologic remission, but a mean of 77% (SD 23.8%) of the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_605'>metaplastic tissue</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients was ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of healed mucosa was higher in patients with short-segment BE (92%) ( p &lt; 0.05) and in subjects treated by two or more laser sessions per centimeter of BE length (89%) ( p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed histologic regression to nondysplastic BE or to squamous epithelium, without recurrence during a mean follow-up of 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients who underwent antireflux surgery and those prescribed pharmacologic treatment had similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nd:YAG and diode laser treatment of BE is a safe, effective procedure; it required two sessions per centimeter of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>; and it achieved complete regression of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to quantify its effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
