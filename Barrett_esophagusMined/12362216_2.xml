<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Data from large epidemiological studies show that Helicobacter pylori is less prevalent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The more virulent cagA-positive strains of the organism are also less commonly seen in patients with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> than in those with less severe forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the relationship between H pylori and gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> is complex, the organism has little effect on acid secretion in most North American or Western European subjects, and has a net suppressive effect, especially in elderly subjects, in other parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the organism has a potential protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, which is exacerbated by gastric acidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>H pylori has no proven effect on other gastric factors that might provoke reflux, including <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>delayed gastric emptying</z:mp> or inappropriate relaxation of the gastric fundus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two well-designed interventional studies have found that eradication of H pylori either provoked <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> or had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A third smaller study, which seemed to demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1264606" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent infection</z:e> was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, was flawed, in that the two treatment groups were not comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The evidence thus does not support the idea that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e> provokes or aggravates <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
