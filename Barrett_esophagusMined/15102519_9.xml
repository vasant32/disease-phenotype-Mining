<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several reports suggest that duodenogastroesophageal reflux may produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>And it is well known that the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has been increasing during the past decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, cyclooxygenase-2 and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi>, produced by the catalytic reaction of cyclooxygenase-2, are considered to relate to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of the digestive tract and other <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent reports suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 is induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the reaction of cyclooxygenase-2 expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandinE2</z:chebi> production on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human esophageal epithelial cells cultured with gastroduodenal components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> human esophageal epithelial cells were cultured with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">chenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi>, trypsin and in acidic condition, individually and with different combinations of these three factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After culturing, cyclooxygenase-2 expression in the cells and amount of prostglandinE2 in culture media was evaluated by immunoblotting and enzyme-immunoassay, respectively after culturing the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase-2 expression was up-regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandinE2</z:chebi> production was enhanced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> with trypsin, acidic condition or both of these components, without a synergistic effect on cyclooxygenase-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandinE2</z:chebi> via these factors was suppressed by the cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor JTE-522 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that duodenogastroesophageal reflux may induce cyclooxygenase-2 expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandinE2</z:chebi> production in esophageal epithelial cells, cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitors may have a chemopreventive effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
