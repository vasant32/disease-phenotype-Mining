<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> is a disease with high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment is controversial and should be individualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elapsed time, location and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> play a role in determining the treatment option: from conservative treatment to esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to report on primary esophagectomy and reconstruction in esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> with expert surgeons and selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting the rare complication of perforated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> presented in one of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASES: We report two patients with esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (one spontaneous and another due to pneumatic <z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>esophageal dilation</z:mp>) treated by primary esophagectomy and reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient with spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and perforated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal resection and immediate reconstruction is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was decided to resect the esophagus in both cases reported here due to the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> in the second case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary reason for immediate reconstruction in selected cases is permanent resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Primary cervical esophagealgastric anastomosis has a lower risk of contamination and leaks than thoracic anastomosis, resulting in mediastinal drainage and parenteral nutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005203'>Spontaneous esophageal perforation</z:hpo> due to perforated Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> is uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, we must consider the importance of early diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is essential to consider the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, location, previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e>, age and general status of the patient in order to undertake appropriate management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Emergency surgery should be individualized and depends on surgeon's experience </plain></SENT>
