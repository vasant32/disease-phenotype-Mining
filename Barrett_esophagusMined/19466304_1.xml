<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and over-weight in patients with heartburn, with and without erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>; to analyze the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and the intensity of abnormal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in both groups of patients, and its relation to body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data of pH monitoring of 362 individuals with heartburn were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was defined by the presence of macroscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> on the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was considered when the gastroesophageal junction was positioned 2 cm or more above the diaphragm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or esophageal peptic stenosis were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The population was categorized according to body mass index as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (body mass index between 20 and 24.9); over-weight (between 25 and 29.9), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (greater than 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis as well as the intensity of abnormal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> were obtained through the analysis of the results of pH monitoring in patients with and without erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and in the various categories of body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 362 patients there were 148 (41%) with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and 214 (59%) without erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, while the pH monitoring was abnormal in 100% and 57%, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 88 (60%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, which was present in 29 (71% of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight), 45 (55% of patients with over-weight) and 14 (56% of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 121 patients without erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> who had abnormal pH monitoring, diagnosed as non erosive reflux disease (38% male, median age 50 years), 51 (42%) patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight, 55 (46%) had over-weight and 15 (12%) were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was detected in 52 out of 121 (43%) patients and in 21 (41%) out of 51 individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight, 24 (44%) of over-weight and 7 (47%) of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the group of 93 patients without erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pH monitoring (29% male, median age 43 years), 26 (28%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and there were 43 (46%) individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight, 38 (41%) with over-weight and 12 (13%) were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and over-weight was significantly higher in the group with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> compared to the ones without erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was also superior in the erosive reflux disease patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The reflux intensity and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> were similar in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight, over-weight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in the group with erosive reflux disease and non-erosive reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was a greater prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and over-weight in the group of patients with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> compared to patients with non-erosive reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in reflux intensity measurements in any of the body mass index categories, in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although there was a major prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> in the group of erosive reflux disease patients, this superiority was not extended to the categories of excessive weight in both groups </plain></SENT>
