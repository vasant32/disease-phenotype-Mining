<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">Proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, but no treatment is available that reduces duodenogastro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">oesophageal reflux</z:e> (DGOR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether adding a prokinetic to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment could improve oesophageal motility and subsequently reduce reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy (prokinetic, n = 12; placebo, n = 11) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At visit 1, ambulatory oesophageal manometry was performed, and peristaltic and simultaneous wave percentage and characteristics were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DGOR and pH measurements were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment with either the prokinetic cisapride or placebo, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigations were repeated (visit 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of covariance and Spearman's correlation coefficients of changes from visit 1 to visit 2 were used to compare data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to DGOR, DGOR characteristics, or the percentage of peristalsis and simultaneous waves and their characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between DGOR and motility changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although no significant differences existed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> in the two groups, five patients with high supine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> showed a significant reduction after treatment with cisapride </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Addition of cisapride to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment does not appear to improve oesophageal motility or reduce DGOR in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
