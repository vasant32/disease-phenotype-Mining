<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differentiating BE from gastric IM and Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> from <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is difficult, especially when IM is short or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are large and involve both sides of the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, the authors identified unique cytokeratin (CK) immunoreactivity patterns that were associated strongly with BE and Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specificity of CK7 and CK20 (CK7/20) expression patterns in patients with IM-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, which is distinct epidemiologically from BE/Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to evaluate the CK7/20 expression patterns in noncardia, IM-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in a Chinese population with a low risk for BE and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and a high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> and gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic biopsy specimens of gastric IM and adjacent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> from 50 consecutive patients with advanced noncardia gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were immunostained for CK7 and CK20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and endoscopic features and H. pylori status were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two gastrointestinal pathologists, blinded to clinical and endoscopic data, independently assessed CK7/20 immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was present in 43 of 50 patients (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the area of IM, patchy CK7 staining was seen in 9 patients (18%), and diffuse CK20 staining was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 50 patients (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The BE CK7/20 pattern characterized by CK7 staining in superficial and deep glands and the CK20 staining in surface epithelium was not seen in any of the 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only one patient (2%) demonstrated a CK7 positive/CK20 negative immunophenotype characteristic of Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining 49 patients (98%) showed non-Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patterns of CK7/20 staining, i.e., a CK7 positive/CK20 positive pattern was seen in 33 patients (66%), a CK7 negative/CK20 positive pattern was seen in 12 patients (24%), and a CK7 negative/CK20 negative pattern was seen in 4 patients (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a patient population without risk factors for the development of BE/esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the CK7/20 pattern characteristic of BE was not present in gastric IM adjacent to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and the CK7/20 pattern characteristic of Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> also was extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that, despite the presence of intestinalized mucosa in both disorders, BE/Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and gastric IM/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> are two distinct clinical entities with unique demographic, clinical, and CK immunophenotypic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results may have application to the evaluation of patients with IM and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising at the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
