<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This could be due to either a multifocal presentation of the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, or different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> arising simultaneously in a dysplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> ('field cancerization') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a report of the genetic analysis of multiple neoplastic sites in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> with an extensive area of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the dysplastic Barrett's epithelium was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the genetic screening, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) allowed evaluation of the whole genome of each specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five cancerous regions were selected and subsequently dissected from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of archival materials enabled a targeted collection of representative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple genetic aberrations were detected by CGH in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Losses on 3p, 4, 7q, 18q, and Y, as well as gains on 8q, 9q, 12p, 13q, 17q, 20p and X, were found in each specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In four out of the five lesions, simultaneous losses on 9p, 15q, and 16q, with concomitant gains on 5p, 7q, and 10p, were disclosed by CGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjacent high-grade dysplastic Barrett's mucosa shared the losses on 3p, 4, 7q, 9p, 18, and Y, as well as the gains on 5p, 7q, 13q, 17q, and X, thereby confirming its precursor status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Within this single and rare case of multifocal Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, a monoclonal genotype was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This must have been caused by an extensive outgrowth of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1298180" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">single tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
