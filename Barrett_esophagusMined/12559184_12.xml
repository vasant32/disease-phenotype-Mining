<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A wide spectrum of endoscopic findings exists in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared clinical outcomes after laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) in patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with and without preoperative endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 1992 to 2001, a total of 414 patients who underwent LARS with 6 months or more of follow-up were prospectively entered into a database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 84 (20%) had no endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> on preoperative endoscopy (group 1), whereas 330 (80%) did have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perioperative outcomes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptom relief, and the use of acid-reducing medication were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative DeMeester scores in groups 1 and 2 were 44 +/- 29 and 61 +/- 62 (P &lt; 0.05) and mean esophageal peristaltic amplitude was 86 +/- 32 mm Hg vs. 60 +/- 42 mm Hg, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although procedure time was significantly shorter in group 1, other perioperative outcomes were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At postoperative follow-up, the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> was reduced in both groups (86% to &lt; or =14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the exception of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, there was no difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptom relief between groups 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> has minimal effect on favorable symptomatic outcomes after LARS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus LARS is an effective treatment option for patients, irrespective of endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, leading to excellent symptom relief and a marked reduction in the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
