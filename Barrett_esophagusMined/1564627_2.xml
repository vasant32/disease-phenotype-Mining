<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The long-term follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in children is not well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 16 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in children treated at this institution during the last 16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ages ranged from 1.2 to 16 years (mean, 10.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 11 boys and 5 girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was documented by endoscopy in 14 instances and at autopsy in 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005208'>secretory diarrhea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> who died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two children had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) and died of their malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo>, 1 Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and 5 were otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six were treated medically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent Nissen fundoplication for complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients were available for follow-up endoscopy (mean, 2 years; range, 1.1 to 5.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy was performed on a yearly basis, obtaining biopsy specimens from multiple levels of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four children had satisfactory clinical response to an antireflux procedure including the resolution of a stricture in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 cases persistent metaplastic epithelium was documented and showed no evidence of regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although there has been speculation that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in children may be more likely to revert to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium than in the adult, there has been only one case of regression in 180 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> occurring in children described in 37 reports in the literature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
