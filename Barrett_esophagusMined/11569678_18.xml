<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The presence of a protective adherent mucus gel barrier against gastric reflux in the healthy esophagus is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to characterize the surface mucin composition and determine the extent of any adherent mucus gel layer on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, and compare this with that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isolated surface mucins were characterized by density centrifugation, gel filtration chromatography, and chemical composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adherent surface mucus was visualized in situ on unfixed and cryostat sections of mucosa and biopsies using a method that preserves mucus layer thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a complete absence of adherent mucus gel layers on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human, pig, and rat esophagi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was in contrast to the thick adherent mucous layer (median thickness = 100-200 microm) seen on the corresponding gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small quantities of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> with a composition characteristic of a secretory mucin were isolated from the pig esophagus surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mucin, density range between 1.44 and 1.48 g x ml(-1), contained 80% carbohydrate and was rich in serine, threonine, and proline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mucin fragmented into smaller <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> units on proteolysis and partially on reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cryostat sections from columnar-lined esophageal biopsies had a substantial adherent surface mucous layer (median thickness = 90 microm, interquartile range = 84-94 microm) staining for neutral mucins (gastric-type epithelium) and acidic mucins (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A secretory mucin, with an analysis distinct from that of gastric or salivary mucin, is present in very small quantities on the esophageal mucosa and in amounts insufficient to form an adherent gel layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that mucus has a role in protecting the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus against reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, an adherent mucous layer was observed over <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e>, and this may protect against reflux </plain></SENT>
