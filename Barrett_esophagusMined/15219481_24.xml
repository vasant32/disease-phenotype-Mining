<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The impact of antireflux surgery on outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, in particular its effect on both the regression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and the progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> through <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This long-term follow-up study evaluated clinical, endoscopic, histopathologic, and physiologic parameters in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who underwent antireflux surgery in a specialist unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1985 and 2001, 58 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (49 long-segment and 9 short-segment) underwent a Rossetti-Nissen fundoplication, 32 via open procedure and 26 laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic follow-up with a detailed questionnaire was available in 58 (100%) and follow-up endoscopy and histology in 57 (98%) patients, and 41 patients (71%) underwent preoperative and postoperative 24-hour pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 59 months, 52 patients (90%) had excellent symptom control, whereas 6 patients (10%) had significant recurrent symptoms and were on regular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of 41 patients having preoperative and postoperative pH monitoring (41%) had a persistent increase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five percent (20 of 57) of patients showed either partial or complete regression of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of 8 patients with preoperative low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed evidence of regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> developed after surgery in 2 patients, and 2 patients developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at 4 and 7 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 of these patients had abnormal postoperative acid scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nissen fundoplication provides excellent long-lasting relief of symptoms in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and may promote regression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Control of symptoms does not concord fully with abolition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Progression of Barrett's to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was only evident in patients with abnormal postoperative acid scores, suggesting that pH monitoring has an important role in the follow-up of surgically treated patients </plain></SENT>
