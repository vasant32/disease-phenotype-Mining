<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical spectrum of 50 consecutive cases of endoscopically consistent, histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients was 65.9 +/- 12.4 (SD) years with only four patients younger than 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predominant presenting symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, heartburn, and regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At endoscopy, the columnar lined segment extended over 6.5 +/- 3.0 cm of the lower esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specialised columnar (intestinal) epithelium was the most frequent histological type identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiologic or endoscopic evidence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was present in the majority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications were present at endoscopy in 38 (76%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (56%) was present at the area of the squamo-columnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stricture formation (38%) and ulceration (36%) were located either at the squamo-columnar junction or more distally within the columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (4%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in a segment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment included physical measures, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bougienage in 20 patients was successful in alleviating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> but multiple treatment sessions were often necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> readily resolved with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> therapy, ulceration was generally resistant to medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Indeed, by two months, healing was achieved in only five of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance of 12 patients who received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> (1 g/day) for at least 12 months showed no regression of the metaplastic mucosa </plain></SENT>
