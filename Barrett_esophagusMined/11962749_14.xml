<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is currently unclear whether <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the esophagogastric junction and in the distal esophagus represent a continuum of the same underlying disease process, i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, or constitute different entities with a different pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biopsies below the Z line might show specialized epithelium in some patients and the question is whether this is another form of short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or whether it is related to a generalized atrophic process of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from recent studies regarding the expression of cytokeratin CK7 and CK20 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) found at the gastroesophageal junction are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prompted by these data we undertook the present study: a) to evaluate the expression of CK7 and CK20 in IM of the gastric cardia and to compare the findings with those in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and IM of the gastric corpus and antrum mucosa; and b) to evaluate the immunophenotype of non-intestinalized cardiac mucosa and to compare it with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of CK7 and CK20 on biopsy specimens from patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n=17) and surgical resection and biopsy specimens of gastric cardia (n=15), corpus (n=14) and antrum (n=22) from patients with histological evidence of IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four biopsy specimens from 42 patients (antrum n=15, corpus n=20, cardia n=7) without evidence of IM were studied as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed an immunophenotype characterised by diffuse moderate to strong CK7 staining on the surface and crypt epithelium combined with strong CK20 staining on the surface and superficial part of the crypts in 94.1% (16/17) of the cases with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but in none of the 36 cases with IM in distal stomach (antrum and corpus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IM in the gastric cardia expressed the immunophenotype seen in IM of the gastric mucosa in 93.3% (14/15) of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac epithelium expressed patchy strong CK7 staining on the surface epithelium and on both, superficial and deep parts of the pits combined with patchy strong CK20 staining on the surface epithelium and superficial pits, a feature permitting distinction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac epithelium from those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric antrum and corpus epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the expression of cytokeratins 7 and 20 can be used to distinguish the origin of IM of the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CK7/20 immunophenotype of IM in the gastric cardia closely resembles that of the IM in the gastric antrum and corpus and is different from IM in long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the CK7/20 immunophenotype of the cardiac epithelium is different from that of the gastric antrum and corpus mucosa, suggesting that cardiac epithelium might not be a native <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric epithelium but one that is acquired as a consequence of longstanding <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Changing pattern of CK7 and CK20 expression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to intestinalized epithelium suggests that IM arising from cardiac epithelium might have distinctive features </plain></SENT>
