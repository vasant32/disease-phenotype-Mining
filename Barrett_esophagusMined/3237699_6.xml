<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Histological and histochemical evaluation of 33 biopsies and 8 distal esophagectomy specimens revealed specialized columnar epithelium with intestinal features [<z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM)] to be the most common type (91%) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Junctional epithelium was found in only 3 of the 33 biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The type III subvariety of IM (TIII-M), characterized by the presence of sulfomucins in the non-goblet columnar cells, was found in 58% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our biopsies and 62% of operative specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of the 7 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath> were associated with TIII-M; one of them subsequently developed an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transitional epithelium adjacent to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in the operative specimens also showed TIII-M in five of six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that TIII-M is almost as common in Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> as in nonneoplastic cases of BE, thereby limiting the usefulness of this histological marker as an indicator of neoplastic change (P = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, TIII-M seems to be significantly associated with mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The value of TIII-M as a prognostic indicator regarding the subsequent development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> remains in doubt and could be more precisely assessed by a prospective study </plain></SENT>
