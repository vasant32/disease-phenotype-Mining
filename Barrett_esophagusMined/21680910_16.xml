<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the reported incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients with BE varies widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the risk of malignant progression in patients with BE using data from the Northern Ireland <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> Register (NIBR), one of the largest population-based registries of BE worldwide, which includes every adult diagnosed with BE in Northern Ireland between 1993 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects and METHODS: We followed 8522 patients with BE, defined as columnar lined epithelium of the esophagus with or without specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM), until the end of 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with incident <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus or gastric cardia or with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus were identified by matching the NIBR with the Northern Ireland <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were identified by matching with records from the Registrar General's Office </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> outcomes or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was calculated as events per 100 person-years (% per year) of follow-up, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine incidence by age, sex, length of BE segment, presence of SIM, macroscopic BE, or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> P values were from two-sided tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a mean of 7.0 years of follow-up, 79 patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, 16 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333763" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the gastric cardia</z:e>, and 36 with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the entire cohort, incidence of esophageal or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333763" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastric cardia cancer</z:e> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> combined was 0.22% per year (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.19% to 0.26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SIM was found in 46.0% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with SIM, the combined incidence was 0.38% per year (95% CI = 0.31 to 0.46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was statistically significantly elevated in patients with vs without SIM at index biopsy (0.38% per year vs 0.07% per year; hazard ratio [HR] = 3.54, 95% CI = 2.09 to 6.00, P &lt; .001), in men compared with women (0.28% per year vs 0.13% per year; HR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.41 to 3.16, P &lt; .001), and in patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> compared with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (1.40% per year vs 0.17% per year; HR = 5.67, 95% CI = 3.77 to 8.53, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found the risk of malignant progression among patients with BE to be lower than previously reported, suggesting that currently recommended surveillance strategies may not be cost-effective </plain></SENT>
