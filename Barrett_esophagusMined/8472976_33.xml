<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The determinants of the oesophageal alkaline pH environment are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Saliva (pH 6.4-7.8) may be a major contributor, although some argue the importance of refluxed alkaline duodenal contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acid and alkaline reflux parameters were studied over 2 days in 30 subjects (control, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> and Barrett's patients; 10 each) using glass pH electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In phase 1, one pH electrode was placed 1 cm below the upper oesophageal sphincter to assess the influence of saliva and the other 5 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phase 2 was identical except that one pH probe was 5 cm below the lower oesophageal sphincter to record <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient groups spent, on average, 50 fold more time during the upright and supine periods at acidic pH than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Saliva was responsible for the percentage of time the pH &gt; 7 and contributed significantly to the percentage of time the pH &gt; 6 in both the proximal and distal oesophagus of control subjects, as shown by an absence of pH &gt; 7 and a significant (p &lt; 0.001) fourfold decrease in pH &gt; 6 during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern was seen in the proximal oesophagus of both reflux groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reflux and Barrett's patients, however did not show a significant decrease in the percentage of time the pH &gt; 6 at night in the distal oesophagus suggesting a relative increase in 'alkaline' exposure from another source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was not because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> as the corresponding pH rises in the fundus of the stomach were non-existent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although this was not studied specifically, it is believed to be a protective meachanism, the result of alkaline secretion produced by submucosal oesophageal glands </plain></SENT>
