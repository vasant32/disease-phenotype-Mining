<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to describe the prevalence of nighttime heartburn and its associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and extra-esophageal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected as part of the ongoing Progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</z:hpo> (ProGERD) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on endoscopy results, patients were categorized as having nonerosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ORs and 95% CIs derived from logistic regression analysis were calculated for the association between nighttime heartburn and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of nighttime heartburn for at least 1 of 3 years was 49%, and 21% of patients reported nighttime heartburn in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to multivariate analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nighttime heartburn was associated with globus sensation (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.29-2.47) and erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.29-2.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to continuous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) intake, noncontinuous <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.73-2.96) and medication other than <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.67-3.62) were also associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nighttime heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of nighttime heartburn in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients under routine care was high, even in patients on continuous <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nighttime heartburn was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or most extra-esophageal symptoms </plain></SENT>
