<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of various <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> on expression of the caudal related homeobox gene Cdx2 in cultured oesophageal squamous epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, morphological and histochemical changes in squamous cells to intestinal epithelial cells were studied in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> induced expression of Cdx2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was created by anastomosing the oesophagus and jejunum, and Cdx2 expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the response of various <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> on Cdx2 gene expression was studied in the human colon epithelial cell lines Caco-2 and HT-29, as well as in cultured rat oesophageal squamous epithelial cells using a Cdx2 promoter luciferase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, primary cultured oesophageal squamous epithelial cells were transfected with Cdx2 expression vectors and their possible transformation to intestinal-type epithelial cells was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Oesophagojejunal anastomoses formed intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath> in rat oesophagus specimens and metaplastic epithelia strongly expressed Cdx2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the effects of 11 types of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> on Cdx2 gene expression were examined, only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16359">cholic acid</z:chebi> (CA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31459">dehydrocholic acid</z:chebi> dose dependently increased Cdx2 promoter activity and Cdx2 protein production in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, and cultured rat oesophageal keratinocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results from mutation analysis of Cdx2 promoter suggested that two nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) binding sites were responsible for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> induced activation of the Cdx2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> were measured in oesophageal refluxate of rats with experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, the concentration of CA was found to be consistent with the experimental dose that augmented Cdx2 expression in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, transfection of the Cdx2 expression vector in cultured rat oesophageal keratinocytes induced production of intestinal-type mucin, MUC2, in cells that expressed Cdx2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that CA activates Cdx2 promoter via NFkappaB and stimulates production of Cdx2 protein in oesophageal keratinocytes with production of intestinal-type mucin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may be one of the mechanisms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
