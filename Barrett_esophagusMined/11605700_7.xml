<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the esophageal motility of patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> before and after photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective study conducted between January 1998 and October 1999, esophageal motility testing of the lower esophageal sphincter and esophageal body was performed with a water-perfused catheter, 2 days before and at least 3 weeks after patients underwent photodynamic therapy for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motility, ineffective esophageal motility, or aperistalsis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were studied, 13 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 11 patients (48%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motility, 6 (26%) had ineffective esophageal motility, and 6 (26%) had aperistalsis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients with aperistalsis had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up tracings after photodynamic therapy found that 6 patients (26%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motility, 7 (30%) had ineffective esophageal motility, and 10 (43%) had aperistalsis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Esophageal dysmotility</z:e> is common in patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy may worsen esophageal motility in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> after photodynamic therapy therefore may be related to underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal dysmotility</z:e> and may not always be caused by stricture or underlying <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
