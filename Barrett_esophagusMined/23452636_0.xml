<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To reduce the clinical impact of this disease, endoscopic screening to detect BE has been proposed and nonendoscopic diagnostic techniques are under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because screening would result in new diagnoses of BE and additional costs related to endoscopic surveillance, novel tools for risk stratification are also warranted </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular biomarkers may provide a more objective and reproducible estimation of the individual risk, and further prospective studies are required as a prelude to introducing biomarkers into routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
