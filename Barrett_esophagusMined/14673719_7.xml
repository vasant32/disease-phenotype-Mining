<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> has been increasing in Japan as it has in Western countries, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is less common in Japan than in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate esophageal motility and clinical characteristics in Japanese patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with BE were compared with ten patients with mild reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE), ten patients with severe RE, and ten healthy subjects of comparable age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori was investigated in the patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intraluminal microtransducer method was used to test for esophageal motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure was assessed by the rapid pull-through method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The esophageal wave after ten repeated 5-ml water swallowings at 30-s intervals was measured at 3, 8, 13, and 18 cm above the LES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The basal LES pressure, the amplitude of the esophageal wave at 3 and 8 cm above the LES, and the frequency of primary peristalsis in the severe RE group and BE group were significantly lower than the values in the healthy subjects and the mild RE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The amplitude of the esophageal wave 13 cm above the LES in the BE group was significantly lower than that in the healthy subjects and the mild RE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the severe RE group and the BE group in the basal LES pressure and the amplitude of the esophageal wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of primary peristalsis in the BE group, however, was significantly lower than that in the severe RE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine of the ten patients with BE were H. pylori-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our conclusions are that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal dysmotility</z:e> in Japanese patients with BE represents an advanced stage of severe RE, and that most Japanese patients with BE are H. pylori-negative </plain></SENT>
