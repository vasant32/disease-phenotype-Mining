<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> in premalignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> tissue using high resolution Affymetrix mapping 100K SNP arrays as patients progressed through three molecular stages of disease-CDKN2A(LOH) only, CDKN2A(LOH)/TP53(LOH), and CDKN2A(LOH)/TP53(LOH) with <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within individuals over time, we observed increases in both numbers and sizes of regions of LOH or copy number change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the earliest CDKN2A(LOH) only samples, we detected few regions with both copy change and LOH, whereas copy loss and LOH were highly correlated in more advanced samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that genomic instability increases in severity and changes character during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, distinct patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> could be discerned within a segment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, this study illustrates that pre-malignant disease can be associated with extensive instability and clonal dynamics that evolve from an initial stage characterized by small recombination-based alterations to one with larger copy change events likely associated with mitotic instability </plain></SENT>
