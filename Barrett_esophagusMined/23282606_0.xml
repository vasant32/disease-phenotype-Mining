<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To report a single surgeon experience with laparoscopic surgery for benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective analysis of 421 patients (160 males) with benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e>, who were subjected to laparoscopic surgery by a single surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediate mortality, surgical complications and long term results in terms of symptoms recurrence, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The underlying diagnoses of the operated patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 257, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> in 91, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> in 68 and esophageal diverticula in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery obtained successful results in 90% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, there was a 12% rate of complications and a 30% recurrence, when a mesh was not used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> the recurrence rate was less than 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery has a fair success rate in benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal diseases</z:e>, with a lower rate of complications </plain></SENT>
