<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The conventional assessment of the premalignant potential of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has recently been shown that abnormalities of growth-regulatory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and their receptors may be important in the pathogenesis of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to improve the diagnostic and prognostic criteria we have studied 21 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and 7 others with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each patient biopsy specimens were taken from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnarlined oesophagus</z:e> or the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and from the gastric cardiac mucosa for routine histologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediately adjacent specimens were taken from both the Barrett's mucosa or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and from the gastric mucosa for flow-cytometric study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter samples were disaggregated and labelled with antibodies to epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The flow cytometer selected cells labelled with each antibody and expressed them as a percentage of the total number of disaggregated cells (average, 5500 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Epidermal growth factor receptors were expressed in a greater number of cells from Barrett's mucosa, with the intestinal type or those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, than in gastric cardiac mucosa (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had many more cells expressing EGF, TGF-alpha, and EGF-R than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that flow-cytometric evaluation of EGF-R can help in the understanding of the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
