<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have previously reported the effect of 2 years of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg daily on columnar-lined (Barrett's) oesophagus (CLO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: In the present study, follow-up has been extended to 5 years to assess the macroscopic and microscopic effects of continuing therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 23 patients have been followed for up to a further 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy with multiple biopsies was performed at the end of years 3, 4 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although there had been a statistically significant regression in the length of CLO after 2 years, there was no overall further measurable change after 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, one patient showed complete macroscopic and microscopic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number and size of macroscopic squamous islands within the CLO continued to increase, and there was a further increase in microscopic squamous re-epithelialization of surface mucosa, gland ducts and Barrett's gland tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found consistently in one patient in biopsies taken up to the end of year 3 but it could not be detected thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">Omeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg daily appears to have beneficial effects on CLO, although it rarely induces a complete regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether the benefits will reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
