<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Uninvestigated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> is common in family practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of clinically significant upper gastrointestinal findings (CSFs) in adult uninvestigated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> patients, and their predictability based on history, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prompt endoscopy was performed within 10 days of referral, in 1040 adult patients presenting with uninvestigated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> at 49 Canadian family practitioner centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent management strategies during a 6-month follow-up period were determined by the individual family practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CSFs were identified in 58% (603/1040) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267055" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Erosive oesophagitis</z:e> was most common (43%; N = 451); <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> was uncommon (5.3%; N = 55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alarm symptoms were uncommon (2.8%; N = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients had at least three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> symptoms, more than 80% had at least six, and approximately half had eight or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the dominant symptom, 463 (45%) patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>-like, 393 (38%) had reflux-like and 184 (18%) had dysmotility-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients' dominant symptom was not predictive of endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Oesophagitis</z:e> was more common in those with dominant reflux-like symptoms and was the most common finding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of gastroduodenal findings was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptom subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (30%; 301/1013) was associated with gastroduodenal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dyspepsia</z:e> subclassifications, based on dominant symptom, are of limited value in predicting the presence and nature of CSFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Oesophagitis</z:e> was by far the most common diagnosis (43% of patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CSFs were common in uninvestigated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> patients and their nature suggests patients could be initially treated effectively, without endoscopy, using empirical acid suppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
