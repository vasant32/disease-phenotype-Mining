<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether these factors may act early in the carcinogenic pathway as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, a potentially premalignant precursor to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> using a case-control design within the Kaiser Permanente, Northern California population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cases (n = 296) were matched to persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) (n = 308) and to population controls (n = 309) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Higher intakes of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25681">omega-3-fatty-acids</z:chebi> [cases vs. population controls; OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.22-0.97, 4th vs. 1st quartiles of intake], polyunsaturated fat, total fiber (OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.15-0.76), and fiber from fruits and vegetables (OR = 0.47 95% CI = 0.25-0.88) were associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher meat intakes were associated with a lower risk of long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.09-0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, higher trans-fat intakes were associated with increased risk (OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.03-1.21 per g/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total fat intake, barbecued foods, and fiber intake from sources other than fruits and vegetables were not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future studies to evaluate whether dietary interventions might influence the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in high risk persons are needed </plain></SENT>
