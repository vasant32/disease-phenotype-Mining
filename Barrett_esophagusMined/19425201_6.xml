<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has increased in Western countries in recent decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to describe the changes in incidence and prevalence of BE diagnosis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> development in BE patients in a South-European Mediterranean area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospective population-based analyses of endoscopy and pathology reports from 1976 to 2001 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from patients with diagnosis of BE and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study period was divided in four quartiles for statistical calculations; parametric and nonparametric tests were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 6.9-fold increase was found in the diagnosis of long-segment BE from the first to the fourth quartile, and a 9.3-fold increase in short-segment BE from 1995 to 2000, in contrast to a much smaller increase of 1.9-fold increase in the number of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjusted incidence of BE diagnosis increased from 0.73 to 9.73 cases/100,000 (first to fourth quartile, respectively) and the adjusted prevalence from 6.51 to 76.04 cases/100,000 (1985-2001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 2.13% per year (95% confidence interval: 0.05-11.3%) - 1.78% for low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 0.36% for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> - giving a total incidence of 1 per 47 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> during follow-up was 0.48% per year (95% confidence interval: 0.006-2.62%), for an incidence of 1 per 210 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients with BE (14 long-segment BE, 5 short-segment BE) were diagnosed with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, with eight being diagnosed during endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 14 (8%) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients diagnosed during the study period had a history of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BE diagnosis has dramatically increased over recent decades in our population, unrelated to an increase in endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Progression to low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Surveillance may have a low impact on the survival of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients in Southern Europe </plain></SENT>
