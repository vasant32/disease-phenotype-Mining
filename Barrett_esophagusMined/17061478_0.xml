<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines for the surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in the context of a Mexican cohort of patients with BE and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For patients with BE and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the ACG has recommended endoscopic surveillance every three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cost-benefit of this strategy has been evaluated in populations with an annual incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) of 1%-5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Demographic, clinical, surveillance and disease progression characteristics were analysed in patients with BE and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> seen at a terciary care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four surveillance strategies were considered, namely endoscopy every one, two, three and four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct medical cost of endoscopy was dollar 2,950.00 Mexican pesos (dollar 256.52 USD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total costs, cost-effectiveness ratios and marginal costs were determined assuming a cohort of 100 BE patients followed for a period of 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A cohort of 185 BE patients was incepted, with a male:female ratio of 1.28:1, mean age of 55.14 years and mean follow-up of 7.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Annual progression rate from no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and AE was 0.30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lowest cost-effectiveness ratio was observed with endoscopic surveillance every five years, with a cost of dollar 202,913.86 Mexican pesos (dollar 17,644.68 USD) per high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and AE diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Mexican patients with BE and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, progression to high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and AE is lower than reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This makes the performance of endoscopy every five years a more cost-effective surveillance strategy in our environment </plain></SENT>
