<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We characterized the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e> constituents in patients with and without complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a new fiber-optic system we studied 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (six male; mean age, 46 years) and 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (17 male; mean age, 58 years), nine with uncomplicated (seven male; mean age, 55 years) and 11 with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (seven with stricture, two with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, and two with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; 10 male; mean age, 61 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting gastric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentrations were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour ambulatory acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> measurements were obtained with the fiber-optic system by using a glass electrode and fiber-optic sensor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were then analyzed for percent total time pH &lt; 4 and &gt; 7 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> absorbance &gt; 0.14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percent times pH &lt; 4, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> absorbance &gt; 0.14%, and fasting gastric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly greater in patients with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> compared with patients with uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with both being higher than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">Acid reflux</z:e> paralleled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> in the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> groups (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.05), but percent time pH &gt; 7 did not differentiate between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) Patients with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> reflux significantly greater amounts of both acid and duodenal contents than patients with uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(2) Complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may be due to synergism between acid and bile rather than either constituent alone </plain></SENT>
