<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Piece-meal endoscopic resection of early neoplastic lesions larger than 15-20 mm is a laborious procedure with the cap technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiband mucosectomy is a new technique using a modified variceal band ligator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Submucosal lifting and prelooping of the snare in the cap is not necessary and multiple resections can be performed with a single snare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We prospectively evaluated the feasibility of multiband mucosectomy for widespread endoscopic resection in patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and compared results retrospectively with prospectively registered endoscopic cap resection procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty multiband mucosectomy procedures were performed in 40 patients and 86 endoscopic cap resection procedures in 53 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median duration of the multiband mucosectomy procedures was 37 vs. 50 min for endoscopic cap resection procedures (P=0.06); median duration per resection was 6 vs. 12 min, respectively (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean diameter of the specimens was 17 vs. 21 mm (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in the endoscopic cap resection group was successfully treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in 6% of multiband mucosectomy and 20% of endoscopic cap resection procedures (P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Technical difficulties during multiband mucosectomy procedures included a decreased visibility owing to the black bands and the releasing wires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multiband mucosectomy allows safe and easy widespread piece-meal resections in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Time and costs appear to be saved compared with the cap technique, and multiband mucosectomy appears to cause less <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> during the endoscopic resection procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiband mucosectomy, however, results in smaller specimens and is, therefore, most suited for en-bloc resection of lesions smaller than 10 mm or for widespread resection of flat mucosa </plain></SENT>
