<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that duodenogastroesophageal reflux plays a role in the progression of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further analyzed the correlation of acid and biliary reflux with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and tested the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with either reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (group 1) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (group 2) prospectively underwent simultaneous 24-h esophageal pH and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> testing without any therapy affecting acid secretion or GI motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 16 patients in group 1 and 18 patients in group 2 were tested again under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Acid and bile exposure were significantly increased in Barrett's patients (n = 23) compared to 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients (median percentage of time that pH was &lt;4 was 24.6% vs 12.4%, p = 0.01, median percentage of time that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> absorbance was &gt;0.2 was 34.7% vs 12.8%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During therapy, both acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> decreased significantly in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median percentage of time that pH was &lt;4 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> absorbance was &gt;0.2 before and during therapy was 18.2%/2.3% and 29.8%/0.7% (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients versus 14.5%/3.6% and 21.5%/0.9% (p = 0.002 and p = 0.011) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In two <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> increased during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a good correlation of the duration of esophageal exposure to acid and bile with the severity of pathological change in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> is significantly suppressed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy with exceptions among individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prolonged simultaneous attack of bile and acid may play a key role in the development of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
