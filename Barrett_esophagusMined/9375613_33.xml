<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy has recently been introduced as a technique for eradicating Barrett's mucosa with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> and the outcomes after resection for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and to compare these results with published results of photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent esophagectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> from 1985 to 1996 and completed a metaanalysis of published results of surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen men and two women with a mean age of 63 years underwent resection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operation was performed through a transhiatal approach in nine and a transthoracic approach in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The final pathologic study demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in four patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>-in-situ in three, and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in eight patients (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients are alive and none of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> has <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A metaanalysis of published results of 119 patients undergoing resection demonstrated an operative mortality of 2.6%, an incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> of 47%, and a 5-year survival in patients with invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A substantial percentage of patients with Barrett's mucosa containing foci of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> have invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Resection is accompanied by a low operative risk, achieves an excellent long-term outcome, and should remain the standard therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
