<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Video-autofluorescence imaging (AFI) and narrow band imaging (NBI) are new endoscopic techniques that may improve the detection of high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AFI improves the detection of lesions but may give false-positive findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NBI allows for detailed inspection of the mucosal and (micro)vascular patterns, which are related to HGIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A proof-of-principle study to combine AFI and NBI to improve the detection of HGIN and to reduce false-positive findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of consecutive eligible patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single-center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twenty patients with BE with suspected or endoscopically treated HGIN were investigated with 2 prototype imaging systems: AFI (inspection with high-resolution videoendoscopy and autofluorescence imaging for detection of lesions) and NBI (for detailed inspection of mucosal and vascular patterns of identified lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesions were sampled for histopathologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The positive predictive value of AFI alone and of AFI-NBI for detecting HGIN and the reduction of false-positive findings because of the use of NBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 28 lesions with HGIN were identified with AFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventeen were identified with white light (61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven suspicious lesions were detected with AFI: 28 contained HGIN (60%) and 19 were false positive (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With NBI, 25 of the true-positive lesions had definitely suspicious patterns, and 3 had dubiously suspicious patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 false positives, 14 were not suspicious on NBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The false-positive rate, therefore, was reduced from 40% to 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found in 4 of the remaining 5 false positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 14 patients with HGIN were identified by AFI-NBI (sensitivity 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Uncontrolled study in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-principle study confirms that AFI can be used as a red-flag technique to detect suspicious lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>With NBI, detailed inspection of the surface patterns can be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This combination may increase the accuracy of detecting HGIN in BE </plain></SENT>
