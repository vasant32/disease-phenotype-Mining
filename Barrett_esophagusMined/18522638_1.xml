<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Roux-en-Y (REY) surgery and medical therapy on BM in animals before the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vagus preserving esophagojejunostomy operation was performed on Sprague-Dawley rats to achieve gastroduodenal reflux (GDR) into the esophagus in 30 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 3 months, changes were reversed in 10 animals (Group REY) by REY operation, 10 animals (Group <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>]) were given <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> during the postoperative period, and 10 animals (Group GDR) did not have further intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 4 months, histological examination of the lower esophagus was performed by an experienced pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters were also analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals preoperatively and at 4 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The length of columnar mucosa, degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, and composite BM score were significantly reduced by REY surgery compared with medical therapy and with control (columnar mucosa in cm [mean +/- standard error of the mean] Group REY 0.44 +/- 0.06, Group <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> 0.92 +/- 0.08, P &lt; 0.001/Group GDR 1.17 +/- 0.31, P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> seen in any specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 4 months, postoperatively controls Group REY surgery showed significantly more normalization of physiological parameters to preoperative levels than Group <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>REY surgery is potentially more beneficial than medical therapy in reversing the histological and biochemical changes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> due to GDR </plain></SENT>
