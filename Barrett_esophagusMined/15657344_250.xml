<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is rising dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This increase may reflect increased disease burden, reclassification of related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, or overdiagnosis resulting from increased diagnostic intensity, particularly upper endoscopy for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to extract information on incidence, stage distribution, and disease-specific mortality for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> as well as information on related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1975 to 2001, the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> rose approximately sixfold in the United States (from 4 to 23 cases per million), a relative increase greater than that for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, breast, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reclassification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> is an unlikely explanation for the rise in incidence, because the anatomic distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in general has changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only location with increased incidence is the lower third of the esophagus-the site where <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> typically arises </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reclassification of adjacent <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> is also unlikely because its incidence has also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because there has been little change in the proportion of patients found with in situ or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> at diagnosis since 1975 (from 25% to 31%) and because esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> mortality has increased more than sevenfold (from 2 to 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> per million), overdiagnosis can be excluded as an explanation for the rise in incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rising incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> represents a real increase in disease burden </plain></SENT>
