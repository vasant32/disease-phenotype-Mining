<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite being common in epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, the timing of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) up-regulation is poorly understood and therefore hampers the identification of the receptor to target for effective treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine if RTK expression changes were early events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and its pre-invasive lesion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, were used for immunohistochemical analysis of the RTK panel, EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, Met, and FGFR2, by utilizing a cohort of patients with invasive disease (n = 367) and two cohorts with pre-invasive disease, one cross-sectional (n = 110) and one longitudinal in time (n = 91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that 51% of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> overexpressed at least one of the RTK panel, with 21% of these overexpressing multiple receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of RTK expression was an early event corresponding with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> development (25% in areas without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> versus 63% in low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for an increase in the prevalence of concomitant overexpression of multiple receptors as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> progressed to low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 7% versus 10%; and from low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 10% versus 19% (p = 0.06 and 0.24, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The timing of receptor up-regulation varied; FGFR, ErbB2, and Met overexpression occurred as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> first developed, whilst EGFR overexpression was predominately seen in invasive disease and ErbB3 overexpression was uniformly rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence for a frequent and early role for multiple different RTKs in oesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given the early timing of receptor deregulation, inhibiting RTKs in pre-invasive disease may also represent a novel and effective chemopreventive strategy </plain></SENT>
