<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> is difficult to ascertain in individuals, as a significant number of patients with BE do not necessarily progress to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are several issues with the current strategy of using <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> as a marker of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is subject to sampling error during biopsy acquisition and interobserver variability among gastrointestinal pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ideal biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity are needed to accurately detect high-risk BE patients for early intervention and appropriate cost-effective surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To date, there are no available molecular tests in routine clinical practice despite known genetic and epigenetic aberrations in the Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review, we present potential biomarkers for the prediction of malignant progression in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These include markers of genomic instability, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor loci abnormalities, epigenetic changes, proliferation markers, cell cycle predictors, and immunohistochemical markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further work in translating biomarkers for routine clinical use may eventually lead to accurate risk stratification </plain></SENT>
