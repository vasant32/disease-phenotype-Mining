<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is a spectrum of disease that includes nonerosive reflux disease (NERD), erosive reflux disease (ERD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment outcomes for patients with different stages have differed in many studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, acid suppressant medication therapy is reported to be less effective for treating patients with NERD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to investigate (1) the role of mechanical factors including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) competence in the spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and (2) outcomes of Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From the records of patients who had undergone laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication after an abnormal pH study, we identified 50 symptomatic consecutive patients with each of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> stages: (1) NERD, (2) mild ERD, defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> that was healed with acid suppression therapy, (3) severe ERD, defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> that persisted despite medical therapy, and (4) BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distal esophageal acid exposure, esophageal pH monitoring performed elsewhere, antireflux surgery less than 1 year previously or previous fundoplication, and a named <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal motility disorder</z:e> or distal esophageal low amplitude hypomotility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who could not be contacted for the study were also excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients completed a detailed preoperative questionnaire; underwent preoperative upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, stationary manometry, and distal esophageal pH monitoring; and were interviewed at least 1 year after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred sixty patients meeting the entry criteria were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 36.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The only significant preoperative symptom difference was that patients with BE had more moderately severe or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> compared to patients with NERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe ERD or BE had a significantly higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, lower LES pressures, and more esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and hypotensive LES were present in most patients with severe ERD or BE but in only a minority of patients with NERD or mild ERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Surgical therapy resulted in similarly excellent symptom outcomes for patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared to mild ERD and NERD, severe ERD and BE are associated with significantly greater loss of the mechanical antireflux barrier as reflected in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and LES measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Restoration of the antireflux barrier and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> reduction by laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication provides similarly excellent symptom control in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
