<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of string capsule endoscopy (SCE) for the screening of BE by using specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> as the criterion standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, blinded, comparative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Endoscopy unit, Veterans Affairs medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux symptoms who were undergoing EGD for screening for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: SCE performed immediately before EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The yield of SCE was compared with EGD for the visual and histologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred patients, 86 men and 14 women, with a mean age of 56.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and the specificity of SCE for the visual diagnosis of BE were 78.3% and 82.8%, respectively, when compared with EGD; the kappa index was 0.676 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and the specificity of SCE for the histologic diagnosis of BE were 93.5% and 78.7%, respectively, with a kappa index of 0.66 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred; the procedure was well tolerated, and 80% of the patients indicated that they would prefer SCE to EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 4 capsules were used for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When compared with EGD, SCE had an acceptable sensitivity and specificity for the visual diagnosis of BE and compared favorably when histology was used as the criterion standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SCE was safe and well tolerated, with a high patient's preference rate, and it may prove to be cost effective for the screening of this condition </plain></SENT>
