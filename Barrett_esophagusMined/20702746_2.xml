<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the associations among dietary <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> intake and these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed an assessment of dietary <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> intake in a case control study of RE (n = 219), BE (n = 220), EAC (n = 224), and matched population controls (n = 256) (the Factors Influencing the Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> Relationship study) using a modification of a validated FFQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that overall <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> index, a measure of the combined intake of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, vitamin E, total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoids</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>, was associated with a reduced risk of EAC [odds ratio (OR) = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.33-0.98], but not BE (OR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.53-1.71) or RE (OR = 1.60; 95% CI = 0.86-2.98), for those in the highest compared with lowest category of intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those in the highest category of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> intake had a lower risk of EAC (OR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.21-0.66; P-trend = 0.001) and RE (OR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.24-0.90; P-trend = 0.03) compared with those in the lowest category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">Vitamin C</z:chebi> intake was not associated with BE, and intake of vitamin E, total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoids</z:chebi>, zinc, copper, or <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> was not associated with EAC, BE, or RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the overall <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> index was associated with a reduced risk of EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher dietary intake of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> was associated with a reduced risk of EAC and RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> may play a role in the pathogenesis of RE and EAC and may be more important in terms of progression rather than initiation of the disease process </plain></SENT>
