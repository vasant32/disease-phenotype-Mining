<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The methods of endoscopic ablation of metaplastic and dysplastic areas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> so far described, are not satisfactory with respect to efficacy and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore we investigated whether photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) with topical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">delta-aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> (delta-ALA) leads to ablation of specialized columnar epithelium and eradication of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> while not producing <z:mp ids='MP_0005653'>phototoxicity</z:mp> and systemic side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 14 patients with histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, seven of whom had evidence of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, underwent endoscopic treatment with topical delta-ALA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Photoactivation (wavelength, 632 nm) was performed at 1.5 - 2 hours after drug administration using an <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> dye laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 80 mg daily for 2 months; thereafter; maintenance therapy depended on reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were endoscopically re-evaluated after 7 days, and subsequently at 3, 6, 12 and up to 48 months (mean follow up 33 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Re-treatment with high-dose topical delta-ALA was offered to the 11 patients with remaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and was carried out in five of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was eradicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> before <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> developed a high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete ablation of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was observed in 21 % of the patients after the first treatment session and in 20 % after the second treatment session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean reduction in the length of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was 1.54 +/- 1.29 cm after the first <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> session and 1.02 +/- 0.80 cm after the second <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Post-endoscopic pain and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000992'>photosensitivity</z:hpo> reactions were less frequent with low-dose delta-ALA <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> than with high-dose <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> (pain 15 %, 100 %, respectively; P = 0.001 by Fisher's exact test; <z:mp ids='MP_0005653'>phototoxicity</z:mp>, 0 %, 50 %, respectively; P = 0.021 by Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low-dose topical administration of delta-ALA provides ablation of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the range obtained with oral delta-ALA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is safe and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Since, however, topical administration of delta-ALA is not able to consistently eradicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, alternative methods will have to be developed </plain></SENT>
