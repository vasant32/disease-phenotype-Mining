<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intestinal-type epithelium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, so-called specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM), is a risk factor for the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surface expression of decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a complement-regulatory protein, is markedly enhanced in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined DAF expression in areas of SIM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in an attempt to determine whether DAF is a biomarker of SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We obtained 53 endoscopic biopsy specimens from the esophageal columnar mucosae of 45 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We immunohistochemically examined the distribution of DAF and 2 other complement-regulatory proteins: homologous restriction factor-20 and membrane cofactor protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also examined the expression of DAF <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> in SIM with the use of laser-capture microdissection and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 53 specimens, 10 were found histologically to involve areas of SIM, 41 were SIM-negative epithelium, and 2 comprised areas of SIM and SIM-negative epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DAF staining was negligible in 35 of 43 specimens of the SIM-negative columnar epithelium, but DAF was strongly stained on the apical surface in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 SIM-positive specimens (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 2 biopsy specimens in which both SIM and SIM-negative columnar epithelium were present, DAF staining was confined to the area of SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of DAF <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> was detected significantly more often in SIM than in SIM-negative columnar epithelium (P =.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that DAF may be a surface marker for SIM and therefore useful in the identification of areas of the mucosa at risk for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
