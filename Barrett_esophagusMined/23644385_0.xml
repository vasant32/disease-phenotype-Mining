<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the efficacy and durability of RFA for patients with dysplastic and non-dysplastic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies identified in PubMed and EMBASE that reported the proportion of patients treated with RFA who had complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (CE-D) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CE-IM), and the proportion with recurrent IM after successful treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pooled estimates of CE-D, CE-IM, IM recurrence, and adverse events were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 18 studies of 3802 patients reporting efficacy and 6 studies of 540 patients reporting durability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten were prospective cohort studies, 9 were retrospective cohort studies, and 1 was a randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CE-IM was achieved in 78% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 70-86%) and CE-D in 91% (95% CI, 87-95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After eradication, IM recurred in 13% (95% CI, 9-18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> occurred in 0.2% of patients during treatment and in 0.7% of those following CE-IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>Esophageal stricture</z:hpo> was the most common adverse event, reported in 5% of patients (95% CI, 3-7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Confidence in most summary estimates was limited by a high degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, which did not appear to be caused by single outlier studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of BE with RFA results in CE-D and CE-IM in a high proportion of patients, with few recurrences of IM after treatment and a low rate of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the large amount of study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, these data provide additional information for patients and providers to make informed treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
