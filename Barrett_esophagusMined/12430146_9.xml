<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies with PhotoDynamic Therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) in bladder and bronchi have shown that due to scattering and reflection, the actually delivered fluence rate on the surface in a hollow organ can be significantly higher than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this pilot study, we investigated the differences between the primary calculated and the actual measured fluence rate during <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) using 23 independent clinical measurements in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: A KTP-dye module laser at 630 nm was used as light source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Light delivery was performed using a cylindrical light diffuser inserted in the center of an inflatable transparent balloon with a length corresponding to the length of the Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total light output power of the cylindrical diffuser was calibrated using an integrating sphere to deliver a primary fluence rate of 100 mW cm(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two fiber-optic pseudo sphere isotropic detectors were placed on the balloon and were used to measure fluence rate at the surface of the esophageal wall during <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The actual fluence rate measured was 1.5-3.9 times higher than the primary fluence rate for 630 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, the fluence rate amplification factor decreased with increasing redness of the tissue and was less for shorter diffusers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fluence rate variations in time were observed which coincided with patients coughing, movement, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014863" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal spasms</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These factors combined with inter patient variability of the fluence rate measured appears to justify the routine application of this technique in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> of BE </plain></SENT>
