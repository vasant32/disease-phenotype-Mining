<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Endoscopic spray cryoablation is a novel approach for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have reported its efficacy, especially with the use of carbon dioxide (CO (2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the short term efficacy and complications using CO (2) in endoscopic cryoablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent monthly stepwise cryoablation with pressurized CO (2) gas, with follow-up esophageal biopsies until complete histological reversal was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses were analyzed with an intention-to-treat analysis according to complete response for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CR-IM), which was defined as the elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> including specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM), subsquamous SIM, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the biopsies under narrow-band imaging (NBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 22 patients were enrolled, 20 of whom completed the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients declined further ablation after the first cryotherapy session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 44 sessions were performed; a median of 2 sessions per patient (range 1 - 3 sessions) were needed to complete the ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No severe complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up endoscopies were performed in 20 patients (90.9 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (9.1 %) were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 10 months (range 6 - 18 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After cryotherapy, 20 patients (90.9 %) reached CR-IM of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a median number of 3 follow-up endoscopies (range 2 - 4) with biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, recurrence was evident in three patients (13.6 % of the overall population, 15.0 % of the CR-IM population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One of the three patients developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> but no dysplastic change and the other two developed subsquamous SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pressurized CO (2) spray cryotherapy is a relatively effective and safe endoscopic treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
