<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the rapidly increasing incidence rate of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the vast majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> will never go on to develop this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is a rare cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients, and most of these patients die from other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While some studies demonstrate that the overall survival of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is no different than that of the general population, others have suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may be associated with increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Work by Solaymani-Dodran et al., in the current issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality was increased by 37% and mortality from causes other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> was increased by 23% compared to the general population, differences that were eliminated when adjusted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings such as these point out the need for large, well-done epidemiologic studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cohorts in order to develop a better understanding of the natural history of this disease </plain></SENT>
