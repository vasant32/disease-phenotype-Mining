<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated differences in histologic and eosinophil patterns and numbers of mast cells between patients with these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed histologic analyses and immunohistochemical assays for eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), major basic protein (MBP), and tryptase, using biopsy samples from 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (positive results from a pH study and response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, or EoE (negative results from a pH study and positive response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3207">budesonide</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were matched for degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Samples from patients with EoE, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had similar increases in concentrations of eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> or EoE did not differ in amount of basal zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, microabscesses, spongiosis, eosinophil distribution, maximum eosinophils/high-power field (HPF), or composite histologic scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 groups had high levels of EDN and MBP; the levels of eosinophil products were correlated (ρ = 0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extracellular staining for EDN was greater than intracellular staining (2.67 of 3 vs 1.86 of 3); levels tended to be greater in samples from patients with EoE than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (P = .05) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detection of EDN correlated with peak numbers of eosinophils/HPF (ρ = 0.6 for intracellular and extracellular staining) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Peak numbers of tryptase-positive mast cells/HPF were significantly greater in samples from patients with EoE than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (P = .01 and .005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Spearman correlation between eosinophil and mast cell density was a ρ value of 0.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Biopsy samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and EoE, matched for esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo>, have similar changes in histology and levels of EDN and MBP, whereas mast cells from patients with EoE have higher levels of these products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of esophageal eosinophils, rather than etiology, could be the most important determinant of epithelial response </plain></SENT>
