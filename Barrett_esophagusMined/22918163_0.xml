<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to assess the correlation between microvascular density and disease progression of non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the superficial aspects of the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Archival histological specimens from two referral centers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> were selected for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 160 regions marked according to histological grade were assessed with digitally interactive software to measure microvascular density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was quantified in three levels: 0-50, 50-100 and 100-150 μm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the areas of gastric cardia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, microvascular density was significantly different (P&lt;0.0001) among the five groups in the most superficial 150 μm of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when examining the pairwise difference between the groups, there was a significant difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and each of the lower grades of histology (P&lt;0.05) and between high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and each of the lower grades of histology (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These statistically significant differences were preserved in examining the depth at the most superficial 50 μm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have used digital pathology to demonstrate a significant and stepwise increase in microvascular density, which supports the hypothesis that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> has a key role in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the differences in the most superficial mucosal layers are consistent with findings of increased vascularity by depth-restricted imaging modalities </plain></SENT>
