<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controls comprised 95 strictly asymptomatic healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using genomic DNA extracted from blood samples, we identified <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and polymorphic variants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> (Arg156Arg and Lys751Gln), XRCC1 (Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln) and XRCC3 (Thr241Met), and the poly (AT) insertion/deletion of XPC (PAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allelic frequencies were compared between cases and controls using logistic regression to calculate age, gender, smoking and alcohol-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with EADC demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of the XPC PAT homozygous variant genotype compared with asymptomatic controls (OR = 3.82; 95% CI = 1.05-13.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly reduced frequencies were seen for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> Lys751Gln homozygous variant genotype in patients with EADC (OR = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.07-0.88), and for the XRCC1 Arg399Gln homozygous variant genotype in patients with BE (OR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.12-0.64) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (OR = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.12-0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the malignant phenotype probably results from a summation of polymorphic nucleotide excision repair genes showing opposing effects (an increased risk of XPC versus a protective effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of the homozygous variant of XRCC1 Arg399Gln for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and BE suggests that base excision repair alterations may occur early in progression to EADC, likely in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-induced endogenous oxidative or inflammatory DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and BE are highly prevalent in the general population, this protective effect may well explain why only a fraction of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and BE progress into invasive EADC </plain></SENT>
