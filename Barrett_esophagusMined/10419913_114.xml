<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because acid has a dynamic effect on cell proliferation/differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) ex vivo, we investigated the relationship between differentiation, proliferation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE biopsy specimens and explored the role of normalization of intraesophageal pH in altering the BE phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic biopsy specimens of BE (with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) were analyzed for (1) villin, a differentiation marker, by immunoblotting; (2) proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a proliferation marker, by immunohistochemistry; and (3) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by histology before and after 6 months of normalization of intraesophageal pH (confirmed by 24-hour pH monitoring) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, there was a negative correlation (r = -0.79) between villin and PCNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six months later, PCNA expression decreased and villin expression increased (P &lt; 0.001) in 24 patients whose intraesophageal pH normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had persistently pathological intraesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> and no change in villin or PCNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> after 6 months in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In BE, there is an inverse relationship between villin and PCNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In turn, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is unrelated to villin expression and well correlated with PCNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete symptom eradication with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> does not guarantee normalization of intraesophageal pH profile in BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Effective intraesophageal acid suppression favors differentiation and decreases proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intriguing possibility that acid suppression can be used to prevent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> remains to be explored </plain></SENT>
