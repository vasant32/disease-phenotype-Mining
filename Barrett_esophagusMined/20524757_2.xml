<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in Barret's esophagus in currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of dilated intervellular spaces in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional and prospective analysis of consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We selected symptomatic patients &gt; 18 years and both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with recent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use (&lt; 14 days), H-2 antagonists, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>'s or previous upper GI tract surgery were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VARIABLES INCLUDED: Clinical-demographic data, Carlsson-Dent score, conventional endoscopy findings, pH-metry results (in non-erosive) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal biopsies at 2 and 5 cm above the squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dilation of intercellular spaces was measured by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>STATISTICS: Chi square test with a significance level 0.05 was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The following four groups were compared: a) non-erosive reflux disease (n = 14); b) erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n = 5); c) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 13); and d) healthy controls (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the dilation of intervellular spaces was increasingly greater form non-erosive revlux to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and higher in biopsies taken at 5 cm than at 2 cm of the squamous columnar junction (2.72 +/- 1.35 vs. 1.71 +/- 0.48 microg) (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between biopsies at 2 and 5 cm in the order groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: dilation of intercellular spaces was greater in Barrett s esophagus than in the other groups and higher at 5 cm from the squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
