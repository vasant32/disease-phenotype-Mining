<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report three-dimensional (3D) endoscopic microscopy findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, using an endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) system in one patient before and in one patient after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Findings were compared with those in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patient without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patient,findings were of regular flat squamous mucosa with small subepithelial vessels and glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patient, findings were of large, densely packed glands with distortion of mucosal architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the post-RFA case, findings were of a small number of isolated glands buried beneath 300-500 microm of neosquamous epithelium and lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neosquamous epithelium is a marker of successful ablative therapy, while buried glands may have potential for dysplastic progression and are difficult to detect using conventional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a potential role of 3D-OCT endoscopic microscopy for follow-up, including subsurface assessment, of ablative treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
