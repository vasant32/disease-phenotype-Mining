<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is being offered without evidence of efficacy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is not an ideal candidate for a screening programme, as the natural history is unclear, uncertainties surround the indication for intervention and the treatment is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To determine the practices that clinicians employ in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> in the UK, postal questionnaires were sent in May 1997 to 297 randomly selected members of the British Society of Gastroenterology asking for details of their current practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 152 respondents, 106 (70 per cent) performed surveillance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>; 46 (30 per cent) did not carry out screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the practices carried out by physicians or surgeons, teaching or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> general hospital clinicians, or those with an upper gastrointestinal interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a wide disparity in screening interval: just over half (52 per cent) screen at yearly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only nine (8 per cent) took four quadrant biopsies per 2 cm of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nearly half (49 per cent) manage mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by increasing the frequency of endoscopy; only seven (7 per cent) prescribed patients a proton pump inhibiting agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Faced with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 33 (31 per cent) offered surgery immediately; 22 (21 per cent) simply followed the patient by endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those not choosing to perform screening most frequently cited lack of evidence of efficacy as the reason behind their decision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is wide variation in surveillance practices for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some methods are ineffectual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The recommendations made by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> Working Party in 1991 are not followed, possibly because they are not practical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>New workable guidelines based on available evidence and a consensus of expert opinion should be established; this was suggested by 38 per cent of respondents who performed screening </plain></SENT>
