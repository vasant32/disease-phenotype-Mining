<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because aspirin and other <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>, may decrease the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, we investigated the effect of long-term administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chemoprevention for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> Trial (CBET) is a phase IIb multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and low- or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 200 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> or placebo, both administered orally twice daily, and then stratified by grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 48 weeks of treatment in the proportion of biopsy samples with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and placebo arms </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From April 1, 2000, through June 30, 2003, 222 patients were registered into CBET, and 100 of them with low- or high-grade Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were randomly assigned to treatment (49 to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and 51 to placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 48 weeks of treatment, no difference was observed in the median change in the proportion of biopsy samples with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> between treatment groups in either the low-grade (median change with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> = -0.09, interquartile range [IQR] = -0.32 to 0.14 and with placebo = -0.07, IQR = -0.26 to 0.12; P = .64) or high-grade (median change with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> = 0.12, IQR = -0.31 to 0.55, and with placebo = 0.02, IQR = -0.24 to 0.28; P = .88) stratum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences in total surface area of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> levels; in cyclooxygenase-1/2 mRNA levels; or in methylation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes p16, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath>, and E-cadherin were found with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration of 200 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> twice daily for 48 weeks of treatment does not appear to prevent progression of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
