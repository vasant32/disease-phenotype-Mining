<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CDKN2 gene on chromosome 9p21 that encodes the p16 inhibitor of cyclinD/Cdk4 complexes is a target of allelic loss and inactivation in a variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the roles of 9p21 allelic losses and CDKN2 mutations in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in vivo remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the prevalence of allelic loss at 9p21 and mutations in CDKN2 in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and investigated the order in which they occurred relative to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aneuploid cell populations from 32 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who had premalignant epithelium, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, or both, were purified by DNA content flow cytometric cell sorting and evaluated by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of 32 informative patients (75%) had allelic loss at 9p21 in aneuploid cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Premalignant epithelium was available for seven of the patients who had 9p21 allelic losses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>; allelic loss of 9p21 was detected before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Allelic loss of 9p21 preceded the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in 13 of 15 patients (87%) who had aneuploid cell populations detected in premalignant epithelium, and the two events were detected simultaneously in the remaining two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of 22 aneuploid populations (23%) with 9p21 loss had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in the remaining CDKN2 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same mutations and 9p21 allelic losses were also found in the corresponding diploid cells from premalignant epithelium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases that were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there was no evidence for mutation or homozygous deletion of p16 in the other 17 patients with 9p21 allelic loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that 9p21 allelic losses and CDKN2 mutations develop as early lesions in diploid cells before <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
