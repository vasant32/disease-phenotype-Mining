<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The current gold standard for the surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is the Seattle four-quadrant biopsies protocol (4-QB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using endoscopic brush cytology, this study prospectively investigated whether digital image cytometry (DICM) is of additional benefit over regular histology as a predictor for progression to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> during a surveillance of at least 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prospective cohort in this study included 93 patients (72% male) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, baseline endoscopies, and at least one DICM in addition to 4-QB who had been followed up a minimum of 3 years at the time of analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were defined as primary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DICM was performed on Feulgen-restained cytology smears with a continuous collision detection (CCD) three-chip color video camera (Sony) and an AutoCyte QUIC DNA workstation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 93 patients, 11 presented with the diagnosis of HGD and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at baseline endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 82 patients were analyzed after a median follow-up time of 44 months (range, 36-65 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 82 patients, 9 (11%) had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) at baseline histology: One of two patients with LGD and aneuploid DICM showed HGD at follow-up assessment, whereas none of seven patients with LGD and diploid DICM had development of HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 82 patients, 73 (89%) had either specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) without dyplasia or indefinite findings for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at baseline histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the eight patients with SIM and intermediate/aneuploid DICM, two had development of HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of those with negative or indefinite findings for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and diploid DICM had HGD at the follow-up evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, the three patients who had development of HGD showed a pathologic DICM at baseline, and no patient with diploid DICM had HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cytometry from brush cytology as an add-on to histology appears to be of additional benefit during surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whereas an aneuploid/intermediate DICM warrants an early re-endoscopy, a diploid DICM underscores the low-risk status especially of patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
