<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>17p LOH and DNA content abnormalities have been previously reported to predict progression from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluated genome-wide <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> in multiple stages of BE and EA in whole biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients were selected to represent different stages of progression from BE to EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole BE or EA biopsies were minced, and aliquots were processed for flow cytometry and genotyped with a paired constitutive control for each patient using 33,423 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Copy gains, losses, and LOH increased in frequency and size between early- and late-stage BE (P &lt; 0.001), with SNP abnormalities increasing from &lt;2% to &gt;30% in early and late stages, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A set of statistically significant events was unique to either early or late, or both, stages, including previously reported and novel abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total number of SNP alterations was highly correlated with DNA content <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and was sensitive and specific to identify patients with concurrent EA (empirical receiver operating characteristic area under the curve = 0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the exception of 9p LOH, most copy gains, losses, and LOH detected in early stages of BE were smaller than those detected in later stages, and few chromosomal events were common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measures of <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> can be quantified in whole biopsies using SNP-based genotyping and have potential to be an integrated platform for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk stratification in BE </plain></SENT>
