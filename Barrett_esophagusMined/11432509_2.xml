<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus has increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its major risk factor is Barrett's epithelium of which the sine qua non is microscopically diagnosed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Short segment Barrett's epithelium may often be overlooked during routine endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In routine biopsies taken from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing mucosa of the distal oesophagus, the reported rates of short segment Barrett's epithelium in the distal oesophagus reached 36% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared these rates with the results obtained in a community hospital in Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing oesophagogastroduodenoscopy were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens taken from cardia, oesophagogastric junction and 2 cm above the oesophagogastric junction were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> &amp; eosin and Alcian blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 112 study patients (mean age +/- SD 48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>9+/-18.3 years, 51.8% males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine (8.04%) patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (according to specimen from 2 cm above oesophagogastric junction), and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> were found in only four (44.4%) of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these nine patients, six (6.66%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing mucosa and three (3.33%) had macroscopic Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Alcian blue staining revealed two patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> &amp; eosin staining had missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found an 8% prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> compared to 18-36% reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We also determined that the added advantage of routine biopsy was 5.4% </plain></SENT>
