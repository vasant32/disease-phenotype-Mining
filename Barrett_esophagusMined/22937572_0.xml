<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The esophagogastric transition was lined by high columnar epithelium and mucos glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At fetuses of 22-24 week gestational age studied zone didn't have any glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histochemical features of the epithelium, particularly MUC5AC positive staining, corresponded to cardial type of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, defined at adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have revealed that mucosa of the esophagogastric transition has gastric origin and arises before birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found out the islets of columnar epithelium on the surface of the laminated pavement epithelium, indicated about its uneven development up to the birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sites of immature epithelium could be considered as transformation zones both of laminated pavement epithelium or columnar one </plain></SENT>
