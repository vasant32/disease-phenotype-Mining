<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and its associated mortality has increased in developed countries during the last few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detection of EAC at earlier stages could potentially improve survival dramatically in these patients, which is especially important as mortality from EAC remains high despite the available treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, endoscopic surveillance is an attractive option for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, periodic endoscopic surveillance is recommended by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the International Gastroenterology Societies in an attempt to detect EAC at an early and potentially curable stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Currently, the frequency of endoscopic surveillance and its need in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> are under discussion </plain></SENT>
