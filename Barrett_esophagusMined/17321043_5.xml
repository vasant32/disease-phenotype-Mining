<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To identify selective markers for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE and to improve the differentiation between low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight BE esophageal mucosectomies (7 males) were analyzed by conventional histology and immunohistochemistry for p53 and Fluorescence In situ Hybridization (FISH) for chromosomes X, Y, 4, 8, 17, 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The female mucosectomy was considered as a control for the XY probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p53 confirmed multifocal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients displayed increased aneusomy for chromosomes 4, 8, 17 and 18 along the sequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also a trend for chromosome 8 to be below the FISH cutoff; 50% of cases showed aneusomy for chromosome 18 in areas with differing grades of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aneusomy was increased for chromosomes 4 and 17, to a similar extent in LGD and HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In male specimens, the presence of chromosome Y was revealed in Barrett's mucosa and LGD, but not in HGD and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FISH in BE may be useful diagnostic to confirm the diagnosis of HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Loss of chromosome Y might be a selective marker of HGD in male patients </plain></SENT>
