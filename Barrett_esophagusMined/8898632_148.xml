<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of duodenogastroesophageal reflux (DGER) in producing esophageal mucosal injury across the spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty controls (13 men; mean age, 41 years), 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (15 men; mean age, 41 years), and 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (17 men; mean age, 58 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour ambulatory acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> measurements were obtained with Bilitec 2000 using a glass pH electrode and fiberoptic sensor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percentage times pH was &lt; 4, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level was &gt; or = 0.14, and fasting gastric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentrations showed a graded increase across the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Esophageal exposure to both acid and DGER was the most prevalent reflux pattern (100% in patients with complicated and 89% in patients with uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 79% in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and 50% in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority (70%-91%) of DGER episodes occurred in an acidic environment (pH &lt; 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis found a significant correlation (r = 0.73; P &lt; 0.01) between percentage time pH was &lt; 4 and percentage time <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> absorbance level was &gt; or = 0.14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both acid and DGER show a graded increase in severity across the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Acid and DGER occur simultaneously in the majority of the reflux episodes </plain></SENT>
