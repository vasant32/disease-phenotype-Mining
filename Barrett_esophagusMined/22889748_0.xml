<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) mucosa observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has been a hot research topic due to the close relationship with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of esophagus (ACE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Earlier studies found that SIM mucosa was similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal epithelium on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The signal pathway involved in conformation of intestinal epithelium may be a critical initiator for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expressions of key regulators (Tcf4, Cdx2, Hes1 and Math1) in Wnt and Notch signal pathways were measured in 41 paired esophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell morphological changes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus were compared among groups treated by acid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> and the mixture of both media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression levels of regulators (Tcf4, Cdx2, Hes1 and Math1) were found significantly increased in SIM, C ≥ 3Mn and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distinct ultrastructure changes and highly expressed key regulators were also detected at the seventh day for group treated by 400 μmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant expressed regulators in Wnt and Notch pathways were observed in BE tissue and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal cells treated by acid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> and the mixture of both media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study provided preliminary data to understand the mechanism of BE conformation </plain></SENT>
