<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>When the distal esophagus is covered with columnar gastric mucosa up to 2 cm from the esophagogastric junction it is considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If the distal esophagus is covered with columnar epithelium more than 2 cm from the esophagogastric junction, it is called <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a new chromoesophagoscopic method to improve diagnostic testing for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distinctive feature of this method is that 4 to 5 ml of a 1% solution of neutral red is administered intravenously, after which excretion of the stain by the esophageal mucosa is examined by endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromoesophagoscopy has been carried out in 11 patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in four patients, which was proved by histologic evaluation of biopsy specimens obtained from the stained zone of the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that chromoesophagoscopy is an effective, accessible, feasible, safe method for diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It allows us to determine the length of the metaplastic epithelium and the topography of gastric glands; it also allows us to examine parietal cells in the esophagus and estimate the functional activity of these parietal cells in metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
