<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the clinical, histologic, and histochemical staining characteristics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) at an endoscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing esophagogastric junction (IM-EGJ) compared with IM in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (IM-CLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective study included 253 patients referred for elective upper gastrointestinal endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were obtained from 2 cm above and immediately distal to the squamocolumnar junction, the gastric corpus, and the antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Any red mucosa above the EGJ was sampled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IM-CLE (prevalence, 5.5%) typically occurred in white male smokers with a long history of reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IM-EGJ (prevalence, 9.1%) was associated with corpus and antrum <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> and with IM at these sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IM-CLE usually (13/14 [93%]) was the incomplete type IM, whereas only 12 (52%) of 23 patients in the IM-EGJ group had incomplete IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IM-EGJ and IM-CLE should be considered as separate entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to evaluate whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> of IM-EGJ is related to its mucin profile </plain></SENT>
