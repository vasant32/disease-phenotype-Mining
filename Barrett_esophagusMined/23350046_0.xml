<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a novel pH and pressure catheter to investigate the asymmetrical distributions of pH and intra-esophageal pressure in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six acid and weak <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> events were observed, of which 22 were circumferential refluxes with pH drops in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> channels and 14 were partial refluxes with pH drops in some channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increase in transient circumferential intraesophageal pressure was observed just after 72.7% of the circumferential reflux and 42.9% of the partial reflux events </plain></SENT>
