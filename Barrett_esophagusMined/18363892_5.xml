<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed BO (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code 5302) and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and no BO (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 53081, 5301) in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Filled prescriptions for oral <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> and histamine2-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (H2RA) were identified in the VA Pharmacy Benefit Management database during 365 days following diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups with or without <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> or H2RA were compared in unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chart review was used to validate diagnoses in a subset of patients with and without BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We evaluated 7732 patients with BO and 13 457 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and no BO diagnosed between 1/2000 and 12/2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At least one <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> prescription was filled during the first year following diagnosis in 91.5% of BO and 61.4% of non-BO patients (P &lt; 0.0001), and one H2RA in 31.7% of BO and 59.4% of non-BO patients (P &lt; 0.0001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, 6.1% of BO patients were prescribed neither </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median duration for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> filled prescriptions was twice as long for BO (221.7 vs. 106.9 days) compared with non-BO patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ratio of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> or H2RA filled prescription days to available follow-up days among BO subjects was 0.66 (122.8 days were not covered with prescription for either), and 0.55 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with no BO (165.0 days on neither) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Veterans Affairs patients with BO are 50% more likely to be prescribed a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and no BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, on average, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> prescriptions cover only 60% of follow-up time for BO patients </plain></SENT>
