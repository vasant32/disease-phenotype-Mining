<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Expanding the current endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) system with Doppler capability may augment this novel high-resolution cross-sectional imaging technique with functional blood flow information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this feasibility study was to assess the clinical feasibility of an endoscopic Doppler OCT (EDOCT) system in the human GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During routine endoscopy, 22 patients were imaged by using a prototype EDOCT system, which provided color-Doppler and velocity-variance images of mucosal and submucosal blood flow at one frame per second, simultaneously with high-spatial-resolution (10-25 mum) images of tissue microstructure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The images were acquired from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GI tract and pathologic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: Subsurface microstructure and microcirculation images of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathologic GI tissues, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580174" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal hypertensive gastropathy</z:e>, gastric antral vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009311'>duodenal adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, were obtained from 72 individual sites in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in vessel diameter, distribution, density, and blood-flow velocity were observed among the GI tissue pathologies imaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of EDOCT imaging in the human GI tract during routine endoscopy procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EDOCT may detect the different microcirculation patterns exhibited by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diseased tissues, which may be useful for diagnostic imaging and treatment monitoring </plain></SENT>
