<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In 1991 we detected glandular cells with "glassy" cytoplasm (GCs) in human gastric mucosa having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GCs were subsequently found in the gastric mucosa of baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The frequency of GCs (defined as glandular cells with a homogeneously pale, eosinophilic cytoplasm having a ground-glass appearance) was assessed in 403 human esophageal biopsies with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GCs may be in one gland or in a group of glands in metaplastic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of the 403 esophageal biopsies, 176 had cardiac glands with or without oxyntic cells (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_165'>glandular metaplasia</z:mpath> type 1 and 2, respectively) and the remaining 227 cases additionally had goblet cells (that is IM), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_165'>glandular metaplasia</z:mpath> type 3 (namely, Barrett's mucosa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four out of the 403 cases (0.99%) had glands with GCs; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases were recorded among the 227 cases having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_165'>glandular metaplasia</z:mpath> type 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, GCs were detected in 1.8% of the cases with Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Previous studies showed that GCs were present in the gastric mucosa of specimens harbouring a gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that GCs are also present in Barrett's mucosa, a lesion often preceding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between GCs and Barrett's mucosa deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
