<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> size and initial columnar segment length on the success of radiofrequency ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A phase II clinical trial was conducted aimed at evaluating the success of radiofrequency ablation in eradicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Success was defined as complete replacement of the columnar lining with squamous mucosa and lack of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> using light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> size and columnar segment length were measured endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were accrued to the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 55 patients who completed radiofrequency ablation (43 successes, 12 failures), the mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> size was 3.3 cm (range, 0-10 cm), and the mean columnar segment length was 5.4 cm (range, 1-18 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median length of the columnar segment was 3 cm in the successful cases and 8.5 cm in the failed cases (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the median <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> size was identical in the successful and failed cases (3 cm, P = .38), the median <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> size was 7 cm (P = .001) in the 6 patients who experienced nonhealing after the initial ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who were successfully ablated but had larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> and longer columnar segment lengths required significantly more radiofrequency ablation sessions than those with smaller <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> and shorter segments (P = .003 and P = .007, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> and longer columnar segments are more likely to experience failure or nonhealing after radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These patients also require more radiofrequency ablation treatments to achieve successful eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
