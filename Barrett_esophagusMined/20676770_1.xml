<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Heartburn is frequently reported by patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the esophageal sensitivity to acid as a possible mediator of this symptom has not been previously evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms and the esophageal sensitivity to acid perfusion in patients with untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> comprised the control group (ten of them with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were evaluated by a structured clinical questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Objective assessment was performed by ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring and endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Esophageal sensitivity to acid was evaluated by esophageal perfusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17883">ClH</z:chebi> 0.1 N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen (37%) of the 40 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> presented heartburn, but only four of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and/or abnormal esophageal pH recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had abnormal pH recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The esophagus was sensitive to acid in seven (17%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo>, three of them with heartburn and one with abnormal pH recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the control group, 40 of 43 (93%) presented heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Acid perfusion was positive in 32 (74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to acid was lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> than in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of heartburn in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> is high, although its association with objective indicators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> is weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> have lower esophageal sensitivity to acid than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, suggesting that heartburn is does not arise from this condition </plain></SENT>
