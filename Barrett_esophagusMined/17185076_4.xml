<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate how patients with BE estimate and perceive their risk of developing EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Questionnaire study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Patients with BE who were undergoing surveillance endoscopy based on histologic and flow cytometric results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 192 patients with BE were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Individual patients were asked to estimate the numerical risk to develop EAC for patients with BE in general and for themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>How patients perceived their own risk was measured on a scale from "very small" to "very large." RESULTS: At least 1 question was filled out by 169 patients (88% response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of respondents underestimated the numerical risk for patients with BE, in general, to develop EAC, while even more patients (69%) underestimated their own risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most respondents perceived their own risk as very small or small (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Risk estimations may depend on the response scale used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with BE underestimated the numerical risk and perceived their risk of developing EAC as (very) low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite a low perceived risk, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in this group adhered to endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
