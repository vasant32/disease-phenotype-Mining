<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To longitudinally evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal dysmotility</z:e> (ED) in patients with limited cutaneous systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (lcSSc) and diffuse cutaneous systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (dcSSc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult patients with SSc seen between 1995 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were included if they had undergone 2 or more esophageal transit scintigraphy (ETS) studies at least 1 year apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from 382 ETS studies of 102 patients with SSc were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty patients had lcSSc and 22 patients had dcSSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A grading system was used to quantify the degree of esophageal dysfunction, ranging from grade 0 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) to grade 3 (severe hypomotility) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Change in esophageal motility over time was evaluated and compared between the limited and diffuse subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (66.7%) had an abnormal ETS study at any time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of patients with dcSSc, 95.4% had an abnormal ETS study, compared to 58.5% of patients with lcSSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>dcSSc and regurgitation were independent risk factors for ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the presence of anticentromere antibodies or antitopoisomerase (anti-Scl-70) antibodies and an abnormal ETS study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Esophageal motility in patients with dcSSc worsened in 96% of cases compared with only 58.8% in those with lcSSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ED is more frequent in patients with dcSSc than in those with lcSSc, and is more likely to deteriorate over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Given the potential associated risks of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in patients with SSc, routine screening and monitoring for ED is advised </plain></SENT>
