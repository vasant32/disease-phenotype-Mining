<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the safety of transthoracic esophagogastrectomy (TTE) in a multidisciplinary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center and to determine which clinical parameters influenced survival and the rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Although the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at the gastroesophageal junction has been rising rapidly in the United States, controversy still exists about the safety of surgical procedures designed to remove the distal esophagus and proximal stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alternatives to TTE have been proposed because of the reportedly high rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and complications associated with the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 143 patients treated by TTE by one author (1989-1999) were entered into a computerized database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative clinical parameters were tested for effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, complications, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient population consisted of 127 men and 16 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-one patients had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040336" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">tobacco abuse</z:e>, and 118 reported the regular ingestion of alcohol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifteen patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 16 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137,C0751688" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous cell cancer</z:e>, 6 had another form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumor</z:e>, and 6 had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> associated with Barrett epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arising in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1258085" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barrett epithelium</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients were treated with neoadjuvant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients died within 30 days of surgery (mortality rate 2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients (3.5%) had a documented anastomotic leak; three died) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, 42 patients had complications (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six had pulmonary complications (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean length of stay in the intensive care unit was 3.35 days; the mean hospital length of stay was 13.54 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The overall 3-year survival rate was 29.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score and the development of complications predicted an <z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>increased length</z:mp> of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> predicted the development of complication and an <z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>increased length</z:mp> of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>None of the other parameters tested predicted perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Only disease stage, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and blood transfusion affected overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>From these results with a large series of patients with gastroesophageal junction <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, TTE can be performed with a low <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate (2.1%), a low leak rate (3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>5%), and an acceptable complication rate (29%) </plain></SENT>
