<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the association between overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in a group of patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Body mass index of 85 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and 100 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, was compared with that of 171 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences in body mass index between healthy subjects and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was a higher proportion of overweight males and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> females with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> than among healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We did not find an association between overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, but patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> had a higher body mass index than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
