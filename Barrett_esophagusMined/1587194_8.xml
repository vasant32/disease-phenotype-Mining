<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment lasted six months and consisted of three months of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> (mean 2150 mg/day, range 1200-3000 mg/day), followed by three months of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (mean 33 mg/day, range 20-60 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> significantly reduced gastric acid output (P less than 0.001) and gastric volume output (P less than 0.001) compared to a basal evaluation and resulted in complete disappearance of pyrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total reflux time (percent 24 hr intraesophageal pH less than 4) was significantly reduced by <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> (P less than 0.02) and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (P less than 0.001) compared to basal evaluation; however, the effects of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> were significantly greater than <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">Omeprazole</z:chebi> caused a significant increase in serum gastrin concentration compared to both basal and <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopically documented erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was present in nine of the 12 patients, and seven of the 12 patients had Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients had complete resolution of pyrosis and healed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> by six months, but no significant endoscopic regression was observed in the extent of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No side effects occurred with these high doses of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that high-dose <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> are effective therapy for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi>, total reflux times are reduced more than with <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi>, often into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
