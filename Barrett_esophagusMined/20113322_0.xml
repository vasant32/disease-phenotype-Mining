<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their relative effect on quality of life is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) questionnaires were sent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent either EG or ET at our institution over the last 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups were stratified by age and American Society of Anesthesia (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surveys were sent to 77 patients and completed by 14 EG (50%) and by 28 ET patients (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average time between treatment and survey was 4 years in the ET group and 5 years in the EG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in SF-36 scores between EG and ET patients except for superior physical functioning among EG patients 65 and older QOL scores among EG and ET groups were not significantly different than sex age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GIQLI scores were similar between ET and EG patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages (P= 0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GIQLI scores were higher among younger ET patients than young EG patients (P= 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GIQLI scores also tended to be higher among <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> 1 and 2 ET patients than <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> 1 and 2 EG patients, but this did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EG and ET for early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> appear to have similar impact on QOL 1 year or more after treatment compared with age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Negative QOL impact appears to be greater for younger patients undergoing EG than for ET </plain></SENT>
