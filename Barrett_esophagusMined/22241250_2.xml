<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> medications may have chemopreventive properties; we therefore assessed the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use and progression to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 411 persons with Barrett's, Cox regression was used to calculate HRs for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use accounting for variation in use during follow-up and adjusting for age, sex, and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HRs for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were 0.59 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.26-1.33] and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.30-1.54) before and after further adjustment for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among persons with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the HRs for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use were 0.31 (95% CI, 0.11-0.86) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.13-1.26) before and after adding <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> to the model, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While the reduced risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> observed among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> users may be explained by chance, the point estimates are similar in magnitude to those previously reported for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use in this cohort and are unlikely to be confounded by known risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Further study in larger cohorts and meta-analyses of the potential for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> to reduce risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is warranted </plain></SENT>
