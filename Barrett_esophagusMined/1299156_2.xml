<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The approach was through the left chest in 9 of 10 patients (7 short Nissen, 1 Collis Nissen, 1 Collis Belsey) and through the abdomen for 1 (vagotomy, antrectomy and Roux en Y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, 5 of 10 patients still mention episodes of heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo>, which was present in 8 patients before the operation, has been replaced by a slow emptying impression in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopically five patients had a columnar lined esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four more were considered to have ulcerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and stricture which proved to be also <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in the postoperative assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients had preoperative 24 h pH assessment when the technique became available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their postoperative control studies revealed persistent acid exposure but to a lesser degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ten patients had 24 h pH studies in their postoperative assessment and 5 out of 10 still show abnormal exposure to acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Esophageal motility studies did not reveal significant changes to the hypomotility of the distal esophageal body and to the decreased tone of the Lower Esophageal Sphincter area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both radiologically and using esophageal transit scintigrams the esophagus shows atony and poor emptying before the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Retention is increased following the creation of an antireflux technique at the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The success rate of antireflux operations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> patients is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The ideal procedure to use in this condition remains unclear </plain></SENT>
