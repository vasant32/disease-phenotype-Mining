<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, up to 40% of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> occur in patients without prior reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively screened for the presence of BE in asymptomatic subjects older than 50 years of age undergoing screening sigmoidoscopy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects undergoing sigmoidoscopy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening were invited to undergo upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria included symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) more than once a month, use of medications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, or previous endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BE was classified as long-segment BE (LSBE), short-segment BE (SSBE), and microscopic specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagogastric junction (SIM-EGJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 408 potential study candidates, 110 subjects were screened; 9 were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/-SD) age was 61 +/- 9.3 (range, 50-80) years, most of them (73%) Caucasian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) extending above the EGJ was detected in 27 (25%) subjects; 8 (7%) had LSBE, and 19 (17%) had SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE were no more likely to be <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, consumers of tobacco or alcohol, report a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, show association with toxic exposure, or use antacids more than once a month, compared with those without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BE was detected in 25% of asymptomatic male veterans older than 50 years of age undergoing screening sigmoidoscopy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
