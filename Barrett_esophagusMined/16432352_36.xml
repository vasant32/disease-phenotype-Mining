<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To perform a very late subjective and objective follow-up in a group of 67 patients submitted to esophagomyotomy plus a partial antireflux surgery (Dor's technique) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a prospective study that lasted 30 years, 67 patients submitted to surgery were divided into 3 groups: group I followed for 80 to 119 months (15 patients); group II, with follow-up of 120 to 239 months (35 patients); and group III, with follow-up more than 240 months (17 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were submitted to clinical questionnaire, endoscopic evaluation, histologic analysis, radiologic studies, manometric determinations, and 24-hour pH studies late after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients developed a squamous cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> 5, 7, and 15 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the late follow-up, Visick III and IV were seen in 7%, 23%, and 35%, according to the length of follow-up of each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic examination revealed a progressive nonsignificant deterioration of esophageal mucosa, histologic analysis distal to squamous-columnar junction showed a significant decrease of fundic mucosa in patients of group III, with increase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, although not significant time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower esophageal sphincter showed a significant decrease of resting pressure 1 year after surgery, which remained similar at the late control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no return to peristaltic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">Acid reflux</z:e> measured by 24-hour pH studies revealed a progressive increase, and the follow-up was longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>: 6 of them a short-segment and 3 a long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Final clinical results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 67 patients demonstrated excellent or good results in 73% of the cases, development of epidermoid <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 4.5%, and failures in 22.4% of the patients, mainly due to reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Incomplete myotomy was seen in only 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> submitted to esophagomyotomy and Dor's antireflux procedure, there is a progressive clinical deterioration of initially good results if a very long follow-up is performed (23 years after surgery), mainly due to an increase in pathologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> disease and the development of short- or long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
