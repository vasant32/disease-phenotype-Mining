<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report evaluates the efficacy and safety of local endoscopic therapy for high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 5-year period between October 1996 and September 2001, a total of 379 patients were referred with a suspicion of early Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study, 44 patients with HGIN in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were selected for local endoscopic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic resection was carried out in 14 patients in whom the HGIN was re-detectable, and 27 patients in whom the HGIN was not re-detectable underwent photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic resection and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> were combined in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission was achieved in 43 of the 44 patients (97.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No major complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A mean of 1 session was needed to achieve complete local remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 36 months (range 7 - 61 months), recurrent or metachronous lesions were observed in six patients (17.1 %), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom received a second successful endoscopic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic therapy is a safe alternative treatment regimen for HGIN in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, providing a middle way between the widely promulgated options of a "watch-and-wait" policy and radical esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
