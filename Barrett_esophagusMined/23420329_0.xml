<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Diet is a potentially modifiable risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the associations between intakes of fruits and vegetables and risk of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified study subjects from 1,859 participants who underwent the endoscopy in a single VA Medical Center in the US between 2008 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake in the previous year was elicited using a self-administered Block food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and its 95 % confidence interval (CI) for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 151 cases with definite BE and 777 controls completed the FFQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When highest tertile of intake was compared with the lowest, the OR (95 % CI) was 0.46 (0.26-0.81) for dark green vegetables, 0.52 (0.30-0.90) for legumes, 0.50 (0.28-0.90) for total fiber, 0.45 (0.25-0.81) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavones</z:chebi>, 0.52 (0.30-0.67) for total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, and 0.45 (0.26-0.79) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28838">lutein</z:chebi>, adjusting for multiple confounding factors including use of aspirin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux</z:e> symptoms, and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association for dark green vegetables was attenuated after adjustment for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28838">lutein</z:chebi>, total fiber, and total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> (OR = 0.82; 95 % CI 0.30-2.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Higher intake of dark green vegetables was associated with a decreased risk of BE in a veteran population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such an inverse association may be partially mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28838">lutein</z:chebi>, fiber, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The novel findings on the association between intake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28838">lutein</z:chebi>, total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18220">isoflavones</z:chebi> and risk of BE need further confirmation </plain></SENT>
