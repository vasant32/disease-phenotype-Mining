<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients undergoing esophagectomy by a single surgeon for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> between 05/91-05/06 were prospectively entered into an IRB-approved database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> aspects of work-up and treatment were guided by an evolving standardized perioperative clinical pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred forty consecutive patients, mean age of 64 (33-90), underwent ER for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (17) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> stages I-87, II-133, III-94, IV-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty-nine (41%) had neoadjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three percent were American Society of Anesthesiologists class III or IV, and five different operative approaches were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient were managed intraoperatively with a "fluid restriction" protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean intraoperative blood loss was 230 cc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>99.5% of patients were extubated immediately, and mean ICU and hospital stays were 2.25 (1-30) and 11.5 (6-49) days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> was managed with patient-controlled epidural <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> in 98.5%, and 86% were mobilized on day 1 after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 153 patients (45%), most commonly atrial dysrhythmia (13%), and postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic leaks occurred in 13 patients (3.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mortality occurred in one patient (0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were seen in length of stay, operative time, blood loss, or complications in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For stages I, II, and III, patients between 1998-2004 Kaplan-Meier 5-year cumulative survival was 92.4, 57.1, and 34.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> can be done with moderate morbidity and very low mortality, and the expectation of improved levels of survival, especially in early-stage patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Standardized perioperative clinical pathways can provide the infrastructure for the treatment of these patients and should include increased efforts to minimize blood loss and transfusions, improve postoperative pain control and extubation rates, and facilitate early mobilization and discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>ER, as sole therapy or in combination with radiation/chemotherapy, should remain the standard of care in patients with early and locoregional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
