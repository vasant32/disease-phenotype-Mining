<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that esophageal squamous epithelium differs from Barrett's columnar epithelium in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> with respect to subsequent changes in the cell surface expression of CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) and sensitivity to CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immortalized esophageal squamous cells (HET-1A) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cells (BAR-T), and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells (Flo-1) were treated with toxic and nontoxic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> at concentrations observed in gastroesophageal refluxate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD95 cell-surface expression and apoptotic response to activating anti-CD95 antibody treatment was determined by FACScan analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">Bile salt</z:chebi> exposure resulted in a dose-dependent increase in CD95 cell-surface expression in HET-1A cells, but not BAR-T or Flo-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This response occurred rapidly, within a time-frame inconsistent with de novo protein synthesis and was blocked by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, PKC inhibition in Flo-1 cells resulted in an increase in CD95 cell surface expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> exposure, a corresponding increase in the induction of CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed in HET-1A cells; PKC inhibition sensitized Flo-1 cells to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that esophageal squamous cells are sensitized to CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This differential response, compared with columnar epithelial cells, could exert a selection pressure that contributes to the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
