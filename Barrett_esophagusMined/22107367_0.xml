<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate esophageal function and the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in patients with CIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is defined by the presence of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or an abnormal pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one consecutive patients with endoscopic and histological evidence of CIP were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal symptom analysis, 24-hour simultaneous biliary reflux and double-channel pH-monitoring, and esophageal manometry were carried out in 65/71 (92%) patients and in 25 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients were not suitable for testing and were, therefore, excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histological evaluation of the heterotopic islands showed cardia and/or oxyntic mucosa in 64/65 (98%) patients and specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) in one patient (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cardia and/or oxyntic mucosa was accompanied by focally appearing pancreatic acinar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and pancreatic ductal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in 7/64 (11%) and in 1/64 (2%), superficial mucous glands in 6/64 (9%), and SIM in 2/64 (3%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In total, SIM was present in three patients (5%), and one of them had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the gastroesophageal junction, 28 (43%) patients had columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, including nine (14%) patients with SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was present in 37 (57%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients (49%) had abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> in the distal and 25 (38%) in the proximal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormal biliary reflux was present in 25 (38%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the basis of endoscopic and pH studies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> was established in 44/65 (68%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Typical reflux symptoms were common (33/65, 51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The combined 24-hour biliary and double-channel pH-monitoring detected significantly more significant acidic reflux at both measurement points and significantly longer bile exposure time in the distal esophagus in patients with CIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Acid secretion in the CIP was detected in three (5%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Esophageal manometry revealed decreased LES pressure and prolonged relaxation with decreased peristaltic wave amplitude, and an increased number of simultaneous contractions in the esophageal body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The detailed evaluation of the esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and function in subjects with CIP showed a high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate whether combined acidic and biliary reflux is able to promote similar histomorphological changes in the CIP, as it is shown distally in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
