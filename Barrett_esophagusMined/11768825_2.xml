<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A substantial population of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has undergone antireflux surgery but still requires annual surveillance endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients would benefit from a definitive ablation of the Barrett's mucosa, which would remove the malignant potential of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the efficacy of applying ultrasonic energy to remove the epithelium of the lower esophagus in a porcine model with prior Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four Yakutan minipigs underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2 weeks they underwent transgastric Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA; Valleylab, Boulder, CO) ablation of the lower esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Healing of the mucosa was assessed by endoscopy at 2 weeks and pathological examination at 4 weeks after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pigs underwent successful laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete lower esophageal epithelial ablation was accomplished through the fundoplication in three animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One pig developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1321581" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bezoar</z:e> that prohibited ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 2 weeks endoscopy showed patchy squamous epithelial regeneration, which was confirmed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Esophageal specimens at 4 weeks showed complete regeneration of squamous epithelium with a partially healed small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in one animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No stricture formation was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the CUSA technique can completely ablate Barrett's mucosa in the setting of a prior antireflux procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Healing with squamous mucosal regeneration is rapid and complete </plain></SENT>
