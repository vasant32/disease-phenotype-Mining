<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously we have shown that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> in EGDA rats resembled human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in its <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, mucin features and expression of differentiation markers (Lab </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2004;84:753-765) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the phenotype of rat MLE with human MLE, in order to gain insight into the nature of MLE and its potential role in the development of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial sectioning was performed on tissue samples from 32 EGDA rats and 13 patients with established BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections were immunohistochemically stained for a variety of transcription factors and differentiation markers of esophageal squamous epithelium and intestinal columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We detected MLE in 56.3% (18/32) of EGDA rats, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As expected, both rat and human squamous epithelium, but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, expressed squamous transcription factors and differentiation markers (p63, Sox2, CK14 and CK4) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both rat and human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, but not squamous epithelium, expressed intestinal transcription factors and differentiation markers (Cdx2, GATA4, HNF1alpha, villin and Muc2) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rat MLE shared expression patterns of Sox2, CK4, Cdx2, GATA4, villin and Muc2 with human MLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, p63 and CK14 were expressed in a higher proportion of rat MLE compared to humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicate that rat MLE shares similar properties to human MLE in its expression pattern of these markers, not withstanding small differences, and support the concept that MLE may be a transitional stage in the metaplastic conversion of squamous to columnar epithelium in BE </plain></SENT>
