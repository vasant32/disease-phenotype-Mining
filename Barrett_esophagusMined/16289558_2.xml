<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may ultimately lead to the development of a pre-malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and subsequently to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antireflux surgery is an effective therapeutic tool to relieve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms and to normalize the reflux to the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, antireflux surgery may be insufficient to restore oxidative insult, which can promote DNA adduct formation and subsequent initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We aimed to test the effect of antireflux surgery on DNA adduct formation in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 19) with objectively confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> underwent antireflux surgery and were followed up for 6 months after which a symptom evaluation, control endoscopy, biopsy and pH-measurements were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amounts of DNA adducts in the proximal and distal mucosa of the esophagus were measured using the 32-P-postlabelling method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the surgery, esophageal acid exposure was normalized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients and symptoms were relieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was found in six cases in preoperative biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The amount of DNA adducts in the distal esophagus was higher than in the proximal esophagus both pre- and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Antireflux surgery did not change this pattern and was thus not capable of reducing DNA adduct formation </plain></SENT>
