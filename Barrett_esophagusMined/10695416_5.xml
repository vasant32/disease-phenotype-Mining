<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective survery determined the prevalence of BE and its associated complications of dysplastic lesions (DL) and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AD) among an Arabian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: From 2572 patients who had endoscopy in King Fahd Central Hospital (KFCH) Gizan, Saudi Arabia, patients (n = 776) were selected for analysis if they had biopsies of the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients (159 of 776) with biopsy-proven oesophageal lesions were categorized and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The relative frequencies of BE, DL and AD in 159 patients were 8(5%), 5(3%) and 16 (10%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These interpreted to prevalence rates of 0.31%, 1.9%, and 0.62% for the respective lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparison of the mean age +/- SD (in years) of the patients with BE (59.6 +/- 19.8), DL (66 +/- 16.7) and AD (70.6 +/- 12.2) showed to statistically significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major symptoms in the patients with BE were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> (4 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002248'>hematemesis</z:hpo> (2 cases) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This profile was not different from that observed in 79 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of 0.31% in our endoscopy population is at the lower range of the 0.3% to 10% reported in the western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the rate was underestimated by this retrospective survey, in which patients were selectively biopsied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also, it is probable that the majority of individuals in our population with no or minimal symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> do not present themselves or are not referred for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite this limitation, our study confirms the occurrence of BE and its complications among a Saudi population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of BE may increase with the current changes in the life-style and increase in the life-span of the Saudi Arabian population </plain></SENT>
