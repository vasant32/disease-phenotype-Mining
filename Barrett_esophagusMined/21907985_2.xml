<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After endoscopic eradication therapy (EET) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), surveillance of residual/recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> including subsquamous tissue is performed by using biopsy forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare the adequacy of biopsy specimens obtained from neo-squamous (post-EET patients) and native (non-BE patients) squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A case-control study using squamous biopsy specimens obtained at 2 tertiary referral centers was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Two experienced GI pathologists reviewed specimens from patients with neo- (post-EET patients) and native (non-BE patients) squamous mucosa in a blinded fashion after developing standardized criteria to assess tissue depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the proportion of biopsy specimens that contained any amount of lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 193 biopsy specimens (1692 tissue pieces) from 104 patients were reviewed: 163 neo- and 30 native squamous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy specimens, only 37% contained any amount of lamina propria, and, furthermore, fewer than 4% of specimens had sufficient lamina propria (ie, more than two thirds of the entire squamous tissue present) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When examining individual squamous tissue pieces, fewer than 11% contained lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences in the presence of lamina propria were detected between neo- and native squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The majority of esophageal squamous biopsy specimens obtained during endoscopy do not demonstrate lamina propria and subepithelial structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is true for both neo- and native squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens of neo-squamous mucosa obtained after EET appear to be inadequate to exclude subsquamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> because lamina propria is not present in more than 60% of specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This has larger implications in the clinical management of BE patients after EET </plain></SENT>
