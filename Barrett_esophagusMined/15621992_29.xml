<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Duodenogastric-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">esophageal reflux disease</z:e> is directly linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and to the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite this link, little is known about the mutagenic potential of refluxed material on the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the reflux of gastric and duodenal content causes mutations in esophageal mucosa in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven Sprague Dawley/Big Blue F1 lacI transgenic rats underwent esophagoduodenostomy (ED) to surgically create duodeno-gastric-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen nonoperated rats served as negative (n = 7) and as positive (n = 7/<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-N-amyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35803">nitrosamine</z:chebi> [MNAN] intraperitoneally) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed 16 weeks after operation or injection, the entire esophageal mucosa was harvested, and mutation frequency was determined through standard Big Blue Mutagenesis Assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of lacI mutations in esophageal mucosal cells of animals with ED was significantly higher, nearly 1.5-fold, than that of nonoperated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35803">Nitrosamine</z:chebi> administration resulted in a nearly 20-fold increase of lacI mutation frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen mutations were successfully sequenced, 46% occurred at CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> sites and 61% were either C to T or G to A transitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data provide preliminary evidence of the mutagenic potential of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> on esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The specific mutations are markedly higher than would be expected by chance and are similar to that found in p53 mutations of human esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, providing a link to human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
