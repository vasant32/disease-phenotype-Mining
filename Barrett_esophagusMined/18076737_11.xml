<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) is increasingly used for the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, some patients show residual BE either exposed to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface (nonburied) or buried underneath reepithelialized squamous mucosa (buried BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Buried BE may be a serious clinical problem since it can go unnoticed during surveillance endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic potential of buried BE is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological characteristics of nonburied and buried BE in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients selected from a cohort of 52 BE patients who received <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were used for this study because they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had both pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> (nonburied), and post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> buried, BE biopsies, without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The biopsies were immunostained for Ki-67, p53, cyclin D1, bcl-2, TGF-alpha, EGFR, and AMACR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High fidelity DNA histograms were obtained by image cytometry analysis of Feulgen stained slides, and used to determine peak DNA index (DI), DNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, and 5N exceeding rate (5NER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made between pre-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> nonburied BE and post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> nonburied and buried BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> BE showed an elevated Ki-67 crypt proliferation rate (43.3%) and p53, bcl-2, TGF-alpha, and EGFR positivity in 8%, 25%, 75%, and 25% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 and AMACR were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High fidelity DNA histograms showed mild <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in 73% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> buried BE showed a significantly lower Ki-67 crypt proliferation rate (29.9%) in comparison to nonburied BE, in both pre- <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> (43.3%) and post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> (44.4%) biopsies (P &lt; 0.05), but similar rates of positivity for the other <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast to pre-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> nonburied BE biopsies, high fidelity DNA histograms revealed that none of the buried BE (0%), and only 2/9 (11%) nonburied BE post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, showed <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pre-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> nonburied BE, without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, shows elevated crypt proliferation and mild, but frequent, DNA content abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, nonburied BE shows persistently elevated crypt proliferation, but significantly less frequent DNA content abnormalities, whereas buried BE shows decreased crypt proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA content profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> buried BE may have a lower neoplastic potential than pre-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> BE </plain></SENT>
