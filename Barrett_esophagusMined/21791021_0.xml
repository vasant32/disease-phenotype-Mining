<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the pathological features and immunostaining pattern (cytokeratin 7 (CK-7), mucin core <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 (Muc-1)) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CIM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: According to endoscopic diagnosis, patients with gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>cardiac inflammation</z:mp> and BE were selected from March 2008 to February 2009 in Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those patients who had histological findings of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (82 cases of CIM and 64 special type BE) were enrolled in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff and Alcian blue staining and an immunohistochemical examination (CK-7, Muc-1) were undertaken in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Squamous mucosa overlying the columnar crypts with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, also called buried <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, was often found in the BE group (56.2%), mainly as an incomplete type (85.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> in the gastric antrum was more severe in the CIM group (45.1% vs 26.6%), in contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was more severe in the BE group (53.1% vs 35.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CK-7 was highly expressed in the BE group (84.4%) in contrast to the CIM group (37.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the expression of Muc-1 in these two kinds of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (14.1% vs 19.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Buried <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, mainly as an incomplete type, is the major predominant type of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the gastric antrum and esophagus can differentiate BE from CIM to some extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CK-7 immunohistochemical staining can help identify BE and CIM but Muc-1 cannot </plain></SENT>
