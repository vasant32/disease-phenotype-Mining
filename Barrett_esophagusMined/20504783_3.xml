<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation has recently been shown to be effective in the management of gastric antral vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but its utility in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> is undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A 77-year-old man with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> had continued <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> despite <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HALO(90) radiofrequency system (BARRX Medical, Sunnyvale, CA) was used for treatment regions of <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> at an energy density of 12 J/cm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At monthly intervals, over 3 months, radiofrequency ablation was performed with a mean of 7 regions ablated at a time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean treatment time was 29 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> after the first treatment session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was symptom free at 6 months follow-up with minimal evidence of residual mucosal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation appears feasible for treatment of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>, with further studies required </plain></SENT>
