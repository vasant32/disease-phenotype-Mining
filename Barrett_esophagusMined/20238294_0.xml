<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>Chromosomal instability</z:mp> (CIN) is common in Barrett's cells: therefore, we investigated the possible presence of centrosomal aberrations (a main cause of CIN) by centrosomal protein immunostaining in paraffined esophageal samples of patients who developed a Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most (55%) patients, alterations of the pericentriolar material (PCM) signals were evident and consistently marked the transition between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The alterations could even be found in adjacent native squamous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1258085" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epithelium, Barrett</z:e>'s mucosa and submucosal gland cells, as well as in the basal/epibasal layers of the mucosa and submucosal gland duct, which are the regions hosting esophageal stem and progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly support the hypothesis that the three esophageal histotypes (one being pathological) can have a common progenitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, PCM defective signal eventually decreased with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>, possibly to enhance the genome stability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, PCM altered signals in Barrett's mucosa and their apparent evolution in successive histopathological steps were correlated to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo>, suggesting PCM as a possible prognostic marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> relapse </plain></SENT>
