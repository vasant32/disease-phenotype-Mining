<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the proportion of patients with moderate-severe erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EE) who will have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) after healing of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with EE of Los Angeles (LA) class B, C and D who underwent follow-up endoscopy documenting complete mucosal healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 86/169 patients were suspected of having BE (38 before healing and 48 after healing of EE) and, 46/86 eventually had the histological confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At index esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD), BE was suspected in 38/169 (22%), and ultimately, histologically confirmed in 20 of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients where biopsies were performed in the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, BE was detected in 2 and missed in 5 (including 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 131/169 patients (77.5%), BE was not suspected at index EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After healing of EE though, 48 patients had suspicion of BE who underwent biopsies, and in 26 of these histology was positive for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The length of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> had a linear correlation with the length of BE (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Out of multiple variables to predict BE, only the suspicion at index endoscopy was statistically significant (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BE was seen in 46/169 (27%) patients with EE of LA class B, C and D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The length of EE can predict the length of underlying BE segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even when suspected, BE and associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> can be missed in the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>; therefore, repeat evaluation should be considered after complete healing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
