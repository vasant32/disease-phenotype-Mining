<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis of attaining columnar phenotype in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis states that factors locally produced by cells of mesenchymal origin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> induce metaplastic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to elucidate the factors secreted from fibroblasts that cause columnar phenotype in adjacent squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human fibroblast cells were exposed to acidified medium for 20 min, followed by medium neutralization for 2 h, and then total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was hybridized to Sentrix Human-6 Expression BeadChips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, esophageal mucosal biopsy specimens from reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients were examined for HB-EGF expression using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, cells from the human esophageal squamous epithelial cell line HET1A were treated with recombinant HB-EGF, and changes in expressions of Cdx2 and columnar markers were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gene expression profile revealed significant upregulation of a variety of growth factors and inflammatory chemokines in response to acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among them, HB-EGF was upregulated more than 10-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens from reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients showed a strong expression of HB-EGF in fibroblast cells underlying the damaged epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro stimulation of HET1A cells with HB-EGF increased Cdx2 in dose-dependent manners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis of human Cdx2 promoter also revealed its upregulation by HB-EGF stimulation, showing the role of potential responsive elements (AP-1 and NF-kappaB) for its transcriptional activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the columnar markers cytokeratin 7 and villin were also upregulated by HB-EGF stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HB-EGF induces several genes characteristics of columnar phenotypes of esophageal squamous epithelium in a paracrine manner </plain></SENT>
