<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>Kyphosis</z:hpo> is a risk factor for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, which is a strong predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has not yet been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate this relationship, the Cobb angle, a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo>, was measured in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2006 to December 2010, 26 patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (LSBE) were retrospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the comparative groups, 100 consecutive patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) and 100 consecutive control patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were also enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cobb angles were measured on lateral chest radiographs, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> was defined as a Cobb angle of greater than 50° </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>Kyphosis</z:hpo>, along with other patient characteristics, were evaluated as possible predictors for SSBE and LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean Cobb angles in the non-BE, SSBE, and LSBE groups were 31.6° (95% CIs, 29.3°-33.9°), 34.8° (32.1°-37.4°) and 49.4° (44.9°-53.9°), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences were found between the LSBE and the other 2 groups (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean Cobb angles were 33.3°±12.4° and 37.0°±14.1°, respectively in patients without and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (p=0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Predictors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of any length were erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>Kyphosis</z:hpo> had the highest odds ratio for the presence of LSBE (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.05-1.94; p=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other predictors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>Kyphosis</z:hpo> is a risk factor for the presence of LSBE in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
