<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There can be few medical conditions that have been surrounded by as much <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> about their definition or terminology as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE); approximately 30 different terms and eponyms have been used to describe this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The history of this condition can be divided into five stages: (i) descriptive stage, 1906-1950; (ii) "argument" stage, 1950-1963; (iii) "significant" stage, 1963-1973; (iv) surveillance stage, 1973-1990; and (v) refined research stage, 1990-present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of the eponym "Barrett's" to describe CLE is not justified from a historical point of view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lining of the lower esophagus by columnar epithelium was termed "<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>" after the presentation by Barrett in 1957 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although this finding has been attributed to Barrett, the work of others, including Tileston, Lortat-Jacob, and Allison and Johnstone, preceded Barrett's description </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The historical aspects of CLE were reviewed to show how little Norman Barrett had contributed to the core concept of this condition in comparison to the contributions of other investigators, particularly the contribution of Philip Allison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on many discussed historical facts, we are not in favor of retaining the term "<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>" and we propose that CLE be henceforth referred to as "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e>" </plain></SENT>
