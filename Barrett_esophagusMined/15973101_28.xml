<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The risk for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> to develop esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is low, and most patients undergoing surveillance will not develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identification of risk factors may allow for more rational surveillance programs in which patients are stratified according to their individual risk of progressing to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was studied during long-term endoscopic and histologic surveillance in 140 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> free from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for progression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow-up was 5.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients (31.4%) developed low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 7 patients (5%) developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> development was significantly less common after antireflux surgery compared with conventional medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (relative risk = 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-28.6) and long duration of reflux symptoms (relative risk = 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.7) were independently associated with an increased risk of developing high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Successful antireflux surgery protects the Barrett mucosa from developing high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, possibly by better control of reflux of gastric contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is the only clinically useful risk factor that permits stratification of the surveillance intervals according to the risk of the individual patient </plain></SENT>
