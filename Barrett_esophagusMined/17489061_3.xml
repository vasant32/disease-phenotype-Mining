<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: To reinvestigate the prevalence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> among upper endoscopies in a series of Iranian patients, considering the high prevalence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (76%) reported by an earlier Iranian study and the scanty data regarding prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> from Iran and the Middle East </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients referred for upper endoscopy to an outpatient gastroenterology clinic in Tehran (May 2005-January 2006) were interviewed using a questionnaire before endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> was defined as having any degree of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> on endoscopy, or having heartburn or regurgitation on a weekly basis during the preceding 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was diagnosed and graded using Los Angeles classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Check-up patients were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, nonerosive reflux disease, and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> groups were compared with non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> patients with regard to the following factors: sex, age, body mass index (BMI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>, smoking, alcohol use, and level of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 501 consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy (195 men, 306 women; mean+/-SD of age, 44.7+/-15 years; mean+/-SD of BMI, 24.9+/-4.4), 50 and 48% had reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> with and without exclusion of the patients on acid-suppressing drugs in the past 2 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most had grade A (90%) or B (9%) reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one patient (0.2%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By Rome-II criteria, 116 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> symptoms (predominant), of whom 41% had reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High BMI (&gt;25) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> both showed statistically significant associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, whereas nonerosive reflux disease and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were associated only with high BMI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the nonerosive reflux disease patients were of a lower education level than non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> patients, no significant association of education level with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed a significantly higher prevalence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> among Iranian upper-endoscopy outpatients compared with the findings of non-Iranian studies </plain></SENT>
