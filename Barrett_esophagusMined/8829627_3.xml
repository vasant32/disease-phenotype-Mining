<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> provides an excellent model by which to understand the genetic events that lead from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We screened for mutations in the TP53 gene by a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing in ten cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have identified missense mutations in five of the ten samples, three transitions (R282W, G245S, R248W) and two transversions (E286Q and C176F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one case we have analyzed biopsy specimens taken from the same site, one year before the patient developed an intra mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation that was identified in this high grade dysplastic area was identical to that detected in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This would suggest TP53 mutations occur as an early genetic event in the development of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
