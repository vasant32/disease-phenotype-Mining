<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) enables <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells to migrate from the original tissue and invade into stromal components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The E-cadherin promoter is frequently repressed by specific transcriptional repressors including Snail, Slug and Twist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD133 is known to be a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-initiating cells in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to characterize the transcriptional factors for E-cadherin and the representative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cell marker in specimens of early esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) originating from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten surgically treated patients were analyzed in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine the expression of Snail, Slug, Twist and CD133, and the results were scored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unlike previous studies of advanced stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> showing the overexpression of each specific transcriptional protein, the invading edges of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were found to abundantly express Snail, Slug, Twist and CD133 in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, results of this study suggest that early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> predominantly comprise cells with metastatic potential and this evidence adds legitimacy to the complete removal of early EAC </plain></SENT>
