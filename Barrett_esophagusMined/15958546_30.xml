<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study was initiated to test whether expression of COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) is linked to expression of potent inducers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A] and lymphangiogenesis (VEGF-C) in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-three esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were investigated by means of quantitative reverse transcription-PCR for expression of COX-1, COX-2, VEGF-A, and VEGF-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, COX-2 protein expression was determined using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> cell lines (OE-33, OSC-1, and OSC-2) were treated with COX-inhibiting substances (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi>, and SC-560) and the effect on expression of the four genes was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>COX-2 protein expression was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> under analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression levels of COX-1 and COX-2 varied markedly in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues and correlated significantly with each other (P &lt; 0.001, r = 0.726) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, COX expression correlated with expression of VEGF-A (COX-1: P &lt; 0.001, r = 0.753; COX-2: P &lt; 0.001, r = 0.764) and VEGF-C (COX-1: P &lt; 0.001, r = 0.778; COX-2: P &lt; 0.001; r = 0.613) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exposure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> cell lines OE-33, OSC-1, and OSC-2 with three COX-inhibiting substances (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi>, and SC-560) resulted in significantly reduced expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that both COX isoforms may be involved in the pathogenesis of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, as they are linked to the expression of important modulators of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> (VEGF-A) and lymphangiogenesis (VEGF-C) </plain></SENT>
