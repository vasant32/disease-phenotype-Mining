<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to study long-term effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> based on data from the world's largest parent support group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire was completed by 128 former patients, now aged 10 to 34 years (median, 14 years), who were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of the support group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative bougienage was performed in 70% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequently associated anomalies were skeletal (44%), with 18% of patients having a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240953" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">winged scapula</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 30% of patients, food became trapped; this entrapment continues, although with decreasing frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 38% of patients, recurrent episodes of food lodging in the esophagus lasted only a few years, whereas 32% of patients never experienced any swallowing problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The foods most often trapped were apples, meat, and bread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most trapped food is removed by the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, without medical help </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unusual findings of this study were the avoidance of chocolate and sweets by 9% of patients and the habit of eating unorthodox food combinations in 13% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-six percent of patients have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, and 7% have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most successful antireflux prevention was abstinence from eating late in the evening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fundoplication was performed in 16% of patients; however, only 25% of these fundoplication operations were successful immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of patients had more than 4 lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006277" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchitis</z:e> episodes per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Forty-four percent make noises, such as wheezing or whistling, when breathing or straining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight percent are of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> height, and 70% are of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine percent of patients attended regular schools, and 52% were above-average students </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Very few pediatric surgeons have had the opportunity to follow into adulthood such a large group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients themselves feel lost when they undergo the transition from pediatric to adult medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A support group is able to provide an information database, which helps overcome the isolation because of the rareness of the disease and the separation of patients into different medical specialties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Surgeons should be aware of the difficulties that patients and parents face in later life and should seek cooperation with a support group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>J Pediatr Surg 36:605-610 </plain></SENT>
