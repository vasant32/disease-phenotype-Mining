<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relation between intake of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, B vitamins, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32875">methyl-group</z:chebi> donors (methionine, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>, betaine) from foods and supplements, polymorphisms in key <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-metabolizing genes, and risk of BE, esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC), and esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) in 2 population-based case-control studies in Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BE patients without (n = 266) or with (n = 101) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were compared with population controls (n = 577); similarly, EAC (n = 636) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> (n = 245) patients were compared with population controls (n = 1507) using multivariable adjusted logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increasing intake of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> from foods was associated with reduced EAC risk (P-trend = 0.01) and mitigated the increased risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> associated with smoking and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high intake of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> from supplements was associated with a significantly elevated risk of BE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High intakes of <z:chebi fb="12" ids="17015">riboflavin</z:chebi> and methionine from food were associated with increased EAC risk, whereas increasing betaine intake was associated with reduced risks of BE without (P-trend = 0.004) or with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P-trend = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
