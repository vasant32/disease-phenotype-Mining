<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, long-term results in patients with high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) or with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> are still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and the survival of patients with early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was carried out in 66 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">Protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX induced by oral administration of ALA (60 mg/kg body weight orally applied 4-6 hours before <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) was used as the photosensitizer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acid suppression was maintained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between September 1996 and September 2002, 667 patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were referred for local endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 558 patients fulfilled the criteria for local endoscopic therapy, and 66 patients (mean [standard deviation] age 61.4 [10.2] years) with HGIN (group A; n = 35) and early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (group B; n = 31) were treated by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 82 ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 34 of the 35 patients in group A (97%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in group B (100%) achieved a complete response during a median follow-up period of 37 months (interquartile range 23-55) (not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One local recurrence was observed in group A and 10 in group B (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven patients died during follow-up; but, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No major complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival in patients with HGIN was 89%, and, in patients with mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, it was 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The calculated 5-year survival was 97% in group A and 80% in group B, but there occurred no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> related to Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The excellent long-term results of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> with ALA in patients with HGIN or mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> might offer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> with ALA as an alternative to surgical esophagectomy and endoscopic resection, especially in cases with multifocal Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
