<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding and correcting motion artifact may improve image interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, the motion trace was analyzed to show the physiological origin (respiration and heart beat) of the artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed that increasing balloon pressure did not sufficiently suppress the physiological motion artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An automated registration algorithm was designed to correct such artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The performance of the algorithm was evaluated in images of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> porcine esophagus and demonstrated in images of BE in human patients </plain></SENT>
