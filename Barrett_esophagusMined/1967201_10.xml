<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its gene product, P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, acts as a drug efflux pump for chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors studied <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> expression in 28 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (EAs) using a monoclonal antibody directed against this gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> expression in 27 <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (GAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> was detected in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa in 7 of 27 GAs and in 6 of 10 EAs that were resected without prior chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was given before surgical resection in 18 of the EAs studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients had a partial response to chemotherapy, and one had a complete eradication of his <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were negative for P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 12 patients without chemotherapy response, 6 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that expressed P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> is present in EAs and GAs before exposure to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
