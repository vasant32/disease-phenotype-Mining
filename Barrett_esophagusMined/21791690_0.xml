<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of EAC has increased 350% in the last 3 decades without clear etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Finding predisposition genes may improve premorbid risk assessment, genetic counseling, and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide multiplatform approaches may lead to the identification of genes important in BE/EAC development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify risk alleles or mutated genes associated with BE/EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Model-free linkage analyses of 21 concordant-affected sibling pairs with BE/EAC and 11 discordant sibling pairs (2005-2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant germline genomic regions in independent prospectively accrued series of 176 white patients with BE/EAC and 200 ancestry-matched controls (2007-2010) were validated and fine mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Integrating data from these significant genomic regions with somatic gene expression data from 19 BE/EAC tissues yielded 12 "priority" candidate genes for mutation analysis (2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genes that showed mutations in cases but not in controls were further screened in an independent prospectively accrued validation series of 58 cases (2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of germline mutations in genes associated with BE/EAC cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional interrogation of the most commonly mutated gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three major genes, MSR1, ASCC1, and CTHRC1 were associated with BE/EAC (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, 13 patients (11.2%) with BE/EAC carried germline mutations in MSR1, ASCC1, or CTHRC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MSR1 was the most frequently mutated, with 8 of 116 (proportion, 0.069; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.030-0.130; P &lt; .001) cases with c.877C&gt;T (p.R293X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An independent validation series confirmed germline MSR1 mutations in 2 of 58 cases (proportion, 0.035; 95% CI, 0.004-0.120; P = .09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>MSR1 mutation resulted in CCND1 up-regulation in peripheral-protein lysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of BE tissues in MSR1-mutation carriers showed increased nuclear expression of CCND1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MSR1 was significantly associated with the presence of BE/EAC in derivation and validation samples, although it was only present in a small percentage of the cases </plain></SENT>
