<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to detect and evaluate reliable metabolite markers for screening and monitoring treatment of patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) by studying metabolomics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of the study were evaluated not only for EAC but also for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, which are widely regarded as precursors of EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Profiles of metabolites in blood serum were constructed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and statistical analysis methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The metabolite biomarkers discovered were selected to build a predictive model that was then used to test the classifications accuracies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight metabolites showed significant differences in their levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and in the control group on the basis of Student t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A partial least-squares discriminant analysis model built on these metabolites provided excellent classifications of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and the control group, with the area under the receiver operating in a characteristic curve of &gt;0.85 for both training and validation sample sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluated by the same model, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> samples were of mixed classification, and the high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> samples were classified primarily as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pathway study indicated that altered energy metabolism and changes in the trochloroacetic acid cycle were the dominant factors in the biochemistry of EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1H nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolite profiling analysis was shown to be an effective approach to differentiating between patients with EAC and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Good sensitivity and selectivity were shown by using the 8 metabolite markers discovered to predict the classification of samples from the healthy control group and the patients with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum metabolic profiling may have potential for early diagnosis of EAC and may enhance our understanding of its mechanisms </plain></SENT>
