<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of NBI for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients with previously diagnosed BE were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnifying endoscopy was performed by an experienced endoscopist, using both a conventional system and an NBI system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> images were recorded by video and by a digital still image filing system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in images were evaluated by another experienced endoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The quality of images for the visualization of the esophagogastric junction, capillary vessels, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) was judged as: optimal (score of 4), diagnostic (3), suboptimal (2), or nondiagnostic (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In contrast to the low rate of visualization of the esophagogastric junction by conventional endoscopy, visualization of this area endoscopy was better by NBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Net-like blood vessels were more clearly seen on images obtained by NBI endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visualization of the CLE was better by NBI endoscopy than by conventional endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to conventional endoscopy, NBI endoscopy captured the optimal view of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the endoscopic and histopathologic diagnoses was more accurate by NBI endoscopy than by conventional endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Magnifying endoscopy by NBI is more useful than conventional magnifying endoscopy for the diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
