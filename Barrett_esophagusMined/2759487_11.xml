<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DNA image cytometry was performed on Feulgen stained sections from 91 biopsies obtained during prospective endoscopic surveillance of 55 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aneuploid cells were detected in specimens from six of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four subsequently developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> but, in the other two, biopsies had been reported as showing specialised epithelium only, with no apparent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> on clinical follow up to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two of the four patients who subsequently developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, aneuploid cells were only found in biopsies showing overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> but in the two other patients aneuploid cells were present in biopsies taken early in the clinical course before any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had been identified on the original reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of aneuploid cells on cytometry of these 'benign' biopsies allowed us, on histological review, to identify areas of atypia which were interpreted as mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this series <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was always associated with some morphological abnormality varying from mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to frank <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aneuploid cells were not shown in material from one patient who had an oesophagectomy for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or in biopsy material from four patients showing 'indefinite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA cytometry combines an objective assessment of epithelial atypia with the advantage of detecting rare cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and the ability to correlate these events with <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should assist in the more accurate diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and prove useful in identifying those patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> who are at greater risk of subsequently developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
