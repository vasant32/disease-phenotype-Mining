<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cervical esophagus is normally lined by squamous epithelium and is usually not exposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were, first, to investigate whether cardiac mucosa can be acquired in the remnant cervical esophagus after esophagectomy and cervical esophagogastrostomy and, second, to characterize this mucosa if present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of 100 patients who had undergone esophagectomy with gastric pull-up reconstruction were studied retrospectively to identify those who had biopsies from the cervical esophagus proximal to the gastroesophageal anastomosis during postoperative follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histopathology and immunohistochemical stains were reviewed to assess similarity to Barrett's mucosa (cytokeratins [CK] 7 and 20 and DAS-1), cellular proliferation (topoisomerase 2alpha), and the potential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (cyclo-oxygenase 2 [COX-2] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase [<z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp>]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Supra-anastomotic biopsies were performed in 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac mucosa was present in 10 of 20 (50%) patients in whom biopsies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> developed in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CK7/20 and DAS-1 staining of the columnar mucosa showed a pattern similar to Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Topoisomerase 2alpha protein expression was present in 50% of patients with cardiac mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DAS-1 protein was expressed in cervical columnar mucosa but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cardiac mucosa stained weakly for COX-2 and <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac mucosa can be acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Its expression profile is similar to cardiac mucosa and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and different from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal or gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The development of cardiac mucosa is likely to be related to reflux of acid into the remnant cervical esophagus as the first step in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings are applicable to the development of similar changes at the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
