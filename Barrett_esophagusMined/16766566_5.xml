<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There had never been a clear definition of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of cardia before Siewert's classification, which was proposed in 1996 and approved in 1997 at the second International <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>Gastric Cancer</z:hpo> Congress in Munich </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the classification, this study aims to research into the clinicopathological characteristics and surgical modes of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagogastric junction in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study reviewed the data of the distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of cardia and the proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> at the First Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from January 1995 to December 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical patients were defined and classified according to Siewert's classification, and 203 patients were up to the classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then the study compared and analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics and the survival rates of the three types of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 203 patients, there were 29 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal esophagus (Type I); 80 patients with true <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of cardia (Type II); and 94 patients with subcardial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (Type III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Obvious differences were found in the clinicopathological characteristics of the three types, but no significant difference of the 5-year survival rates was found among the three types of patients with curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On the data, the distribution of the three types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was found to be different from that reported in Western countries and in Japan; and the three types of patients who had undergone curative resection were found to have similar 5-year survival rates </plain></SENT>
