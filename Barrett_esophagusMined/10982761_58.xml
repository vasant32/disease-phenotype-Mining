<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent endoscopy and systematic biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before biopsy, each site was sampled by LSS using a fiberoptic probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusely reflected white light was spectrally analyzed to obtain the size distribution of cell nuclei in the mucosal layer, from which the percentage of enlarged nuclei and the degree of crowding were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was assigned if more than 30% of the nuclei exceeded 10 microm and the histologic findings compared with those of 4 pathologists blinded to the light-scattering assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were then retrospectively analyzed to further explore the diagnostic potential of LSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six sites from 13 patients were sampled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> abnormal sites and a random sample of nondysplastic sites were reviewed by the pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average diagnoses were 4 sites from 4 different patients as high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), 8 sites from 5 different patients as low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), 12 as indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 52 as nondysplastic Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of LSS for detecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (either LGD or HGD) were 90% and 90%, respectively, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HGD and 87% of LGD sites correctly classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decision algorithms using both nuclear enlargement and crowding further improved diagnostic accuracy, and accurately classified samples into the 4 histologic categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LSS can reliably detect LGD and HGD in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
