<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to look at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e> in the oesophagus together with motility characteristics in a group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and compare them with a mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> group and to assess the effect of cisapride on any abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective study comparing the two groups of patients was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with histologically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and 20 patients with Savary-Miller grade 2 oesophagitis were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard oesophageal manometric measurements were carried out and on a separate occasion duodenogastro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">oesophageal reflux</z:e> (DGOR) was measured over a 4-h period using a <z:chebi fb="33" ids="29101">sodium ion</z:chebi> selective electrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with more than 5% DGOR were given cisapride (10 mg four times daily) and the studies repeated after 7 days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Barrett's patients showed more DGOR, 12.2% of the study time compared to 5.1% in the mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> group, P = 0.012, but manometric findings were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients were treated with cisapride </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DGOR was reduced in 8 out of 12 Barrett's patients and 2 out of 4 oesophagitis patients, and proximal amplitude and distal oesophageal pressures were significantly elevated (P = 0.05 and P = 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Monitoring of sodium ions in the oesophagus shows that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> have significantly more DGOR than patients with uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> and cisapride may be effective in removal of this reflux </plain></SENT>
