<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have undertaken esophagoscopy 1/2 to 17 1/2 years after surgery in 20 patients with a total gastrectomy and an esophago-jejunal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 5 cases we found a complete columnar lining of the distal esophagus (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett-esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 other cases showed a multilocular columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One case with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett-esophagus</z:hpo> had endoscopy before surgery, and it could be proved that the columnar lining developed after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suspect that it was the same in the remaining cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> examined patients, except one, showed an erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> of varying severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations support the current view that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> is usually an acquired one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis is not completely clear, but reflux of digestive juices destroying the squamous epithelium and impairing healing is the condition for columnar lining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observations on patients with total gastrectomy prove that it must not necessarily be gastric juice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The very urgent question of the origin of columnar lining cannot be answered at present </plain></SENT>
