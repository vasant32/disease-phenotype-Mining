<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To demonstrate the feasibility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging in differentiating cervical inlet patch (CIP) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stomach and duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing standard esophagogastroduodenoscopy at VABHS, including one patient with CIP, one representative patient with BE and three representative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>White light video endoscopy was performed and endoscopic 3D-OCT images were obtained in each patient using a prototype OCT system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The OCT imaging probe passes through the working channel of the endoscope to enable simultaneous video endoscopy and 3D-OCT examination of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standard <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H and E) histology was performed on biopsy or endoscopic mucosal resection specimens in order to compare and validate the 3D-OCT data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CIP was observed from a 68-year old male with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CIP region appeared as a pink circular lesion in the upper esophagus under white light endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OCT imaging over the CIP region showed columnar epithelium structure, which clearly contrasted the squamous epithelium structure from adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3D-OCT images obtained from other representative patients demonstrated distinctive patterns of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, BE, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stomach, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> duodenum bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microstructures, such as squamous epithelium, lamina propria, muscularis mucosa, muscularis propria, esophageal glands, Barrett's glands, gastric mucosa, gastric glands, and intestinal mucosal villi were clearly observed with OCT and matched with H and E histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated the feasibility of using OCT to evaluate GI tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in situ and in real-time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrate in situ evaluation of CIP microstructures using 3D-OCT, which may be a useful tool for future diagnosis and follow-up of patients with CIP </plain></SENT>
