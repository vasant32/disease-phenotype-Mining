<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have examined the relationship between genetic variation of this axis and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) or its precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a population-based case-control study, we investigated the association of common polymorphisms of IGF-1, IGF-2, IGF-1 receptor, IGF binding protein-3, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="37845">growth hormones</z:chebi> (GH) 1 and GH2, and GH receptor with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and thirty RE, 224 BE, 227 EAC cases, and 260 controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene polymorphisms were identified using publicly available online resources; 102 IGF axis tag and putatively functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed using MassARRAY iPLEX and Taqman assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were analyzed using Haploview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three polymorphisms were disease-associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IGF1 SNP rs6214 was associated with BE (adjusted P = .039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using GG genotype as reference, odds ratio for BE in AA (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>) was 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GH receptor SNP rs6898743 was associated with EAC (adjusted P = .0112) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With GG as reference, odds ratio for EAC in CC (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>) genotype was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.23-0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IGF1 (CA)(17) 185-bp allele was associated with RE (adjusted P = .0116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using IGF1(non17) as reference, odds ratio for RE in IGF1(17) carriers was 7.29 (95% CI, 1.57-46.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 3 polymorphisms of IGF genes were associated with EAC or its precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These polymorphisms may be markers of disease risk; independent validation of our findings is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the IGF pathway is involved in EAC development </plain></SENT>
