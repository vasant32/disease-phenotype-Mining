<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Minimally invasive surgery may lower the morbidity of esophagectomy but only a few small series have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From August 1996 to September 1999, 77 patients underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, esophagectomy was approached totally laparoscopically or with mini-thoracotomy; thoracoscopy subsequently replaced thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Indications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> (n = 54), Barrett's high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ (n = 17), and benign miscellaneous (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 50 men and 27 women with an average age of 66 years (range 30 to 94 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median operative time was 7.5 hours (4.5 hours with &gt; 20 case experience) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median intensive care unit stay was 1 day (range 0 to 60 days); median length of stay was 7 days (range 4 to 73 days) with no operative or hospital mortalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were four nonemergent conversions to open esophagectomy; major and minor complication rates were 27% and 55%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive esophagectomy is technically feasible and safe in our center, which has extensive minimally invasive and open esophageal experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Open surgery should remain the standard until future studies conclusively demonstrate advantages of minimally invasive approaches </plain></SENT>
