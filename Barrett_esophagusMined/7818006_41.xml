<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is controversial whether duodenal juice can damage esophageal mucosa in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The issue remains unresolved partly because of difficulties in detecting the presence of duodenal juice in the lower esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: This study utilized an in vitro portable spectrophotometer with a fiberoptic probe capable of detecting bile as a marker of duodenal juice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Absorbance/concentration curves were established with known <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentrations at pH 1.4 and pH 7.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal pH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> absorbance were monitored in vivo over a 24-hour period in 20 healthy volunteers to determine the absorbance threshold for clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four had no mucosal injury, 5 erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The correlation between absorbance and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration was 0.98 and 0.99 for acid and alkaline environments, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> absorbance was 35% less in an acid environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using an absorbance threshold of 0.14, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> taken in toto had elevated esophageal exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> exposure between reflux patients without mucosal injury and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Highest exposure occurred in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An important observation was that esophageal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> exposure frequently occurred during periods when the esophageal pH was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The fiberoptic probe accurately detects esophageal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> as a marker of duodenal juice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Esophageal exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> is uncommon in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> have increased esophageal exposure to duodenal juice compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Reflux of duodenal juice into the esophagus can occur when the esophageal pH is within its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range and is undetectable by pH monitoring alone </plain></SENT>
