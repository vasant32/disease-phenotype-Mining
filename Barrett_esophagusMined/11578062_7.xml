<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cardiectomy was performed in group A (n = 26) as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> model, and total gastrectomy was performed in group B (n = 24) as an alkaline reflux model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After surgery, the esophageal mucosa was observed and biopsied endoscopically every 3 months over a period of 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>c-erbB-2, and PCNA was performed, using biopsied specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group A, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> developed in 14 of the 26 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> occurred in 5 of the 26 dogs, and in 1 of these 5 dogs, it developed into high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this animal, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arose 63 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group B, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> developed in 10 of the 24 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was observed in 4 of the 24 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 1 of these 4 dogs, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> became high-grade and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> occurred 66 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In group A, PCNA was positive in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; the PCNA labeling index (LI) was 58 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>c-erbB-2 and p53 were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In group B, PCNA was positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; the PCNA LI was 77 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>p53 was positive in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>c-erbB-2 was negative in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS; The results of this study provided evidence of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence arising from alkaline reflux, as well as from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of an alkaline reflux model and a 6-year study using dogs to observe the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
