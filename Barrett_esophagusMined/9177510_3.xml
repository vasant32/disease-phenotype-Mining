<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is currently believed to be related to severe and prolonged pathological acid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, other factors have been discussed, especially pancreatic biliary reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the importance of pancreatic-biliary reflux in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, we assessed the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in patients with an intact stomach and in those with previous gastric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective study in which 22,236 upper digestive endoscopy reports were reviewed and classified into two groups: intact stomach (n = 21,023) and operated stomach (n = 1,213) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In turn, these two groups were divided into five subgroups according to surgical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each of the groups and subgroups, we calculated the percentage of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, the percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and the percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients with complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were compared by chi2 test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With regard to the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, we found no significant differences between the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that previous gastric surgery does not increase the risk that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients will develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
