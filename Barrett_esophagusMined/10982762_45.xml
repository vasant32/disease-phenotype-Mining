<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytokeratin (CK) 7 and 20 patterns are specific for long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; however, their utility in short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has not been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic biopsy specimens from patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 49), suspected short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 43), and gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (n = 26) were immunostained for CK7 and CK20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive clinical data were obtained, including age, gender, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and Helicobacter pylori status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A Barrett's CK7/20 pattern was present in 48 (98%) of 49 patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 35 (82%) of 43 with suspected short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and 0 (0%) of 26 patients with gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with suspected short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with a Barrett's CK7/20 pattern were clinically similar to those with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with suspected short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with no Barrett's CK7/20 pattern were clinically similar to those with gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A Barrett's CK7/20 pattern identifies a subset of patients with suspected short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who have a patient profile similar to that seen in long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A Barrett's CK7/20 pattern is an objective marker of Barrett's mucosa that in conjunction with appropriate clinical and endoscopic data can be used by clinicians to better define patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
