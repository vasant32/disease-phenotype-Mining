<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 49-yr-old male was reviewed who had a 10-yr history of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He presented initially with frequent heartburn of moderate severity and, on subsequent endoscopy, was noted to have erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and, at that time, a high maximal gastric acid output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the next 5 yr, his symptoms and acid output diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight years after presentation, he was noted to have developed a small area of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, without dysplastic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten years after the initial presentation he was completely asymptomatic, despite having extensive Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, now with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, he was referred for esophagogastrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of surgery, he had alkaline reflux, with antacid gastric contents and, subsequently, <z:mp ids='MP_0008001'>hypochlorhydria</z:mp> was proven by a pentagastrin test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A second individual (male, 46 yr) who presented initially with reflux symptoms and gastric-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, underwent gastric secretory studies that revealed a peak acid output of 16 mmol/L in 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the period 1989 to 1991, his symptoms progressed despite H2 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this regard he was reinvestigated, and his peak acid output in 1991 was 0 mmol/L, and subsequent esophageal biopsies demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in four of six biopsies (two biopsies had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; the two others had gastric-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>He has refused esophageal resection, and is being reviewed regularly at the endoscopy clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of the esophagus in both individuals revealed expression of epidermal growth factor receptor which was increased in the areas of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, compared with Barrett's mucosa without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that alkaline reflux may accelerate the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (and intestinal type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The increased expressed of epidermal growth factor receptors in Barrett's mucosa with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> compared with Barrett's mucosa without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> may reflect the higher malignant potential of the former mucosa </plain></SENT>
