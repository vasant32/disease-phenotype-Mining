<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The rise in the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has led to the development of new methods to screen for the precursor lesion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the potential role of esophageal capsule endoscopy in identifying the presence of short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent esophageal capsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The images were reviewed by two expert observers with no knowledge of the purpose of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data collected included transit time, quality of image, presence or absence of Z-line, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267081" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Schatzki's ring</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (long or short, definite or suspected) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients were studied; in 18, the capsule passed into the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was identified or suspected in eight cases (44%) by one observer and three (16%) by the second (P= 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the Z-line was seen in the 18 cases that were qualified by both observers, there was an agreement in only six cases as to whether it was regular or irregular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) was scored as present in three and absent in six patients by both readers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nonexisting feline esophagus, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath>, and distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> were suspected in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal capsule endoscopy had a high interobserver variability and a low yield for short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Esophageal capsule endoscopy cannot be recommended for screening for short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
