<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nonoperative therapy with intent to cure may be considered for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a more advanced stage of disease must be precluded before such treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The potential of EUS for this purpose was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EUS was performed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> based on endoscopy, endoscopic biopsies, and CT before esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EUS findings were compared with surgical/pathologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EUS suggested submucosal invasion in 6 patients and lymph node involvement in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By surgical/pathologic evaluation, 5 of 22 patients (23%) had unsuspected submucosal invasion and 1 had lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EUS detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 instances of submucosal invasion and the single instance of lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EUS was falsely positive for submucosal invasion in 1 patient and for lymph node involvement in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values of preoperative EUS for submucosal invasion were 100%, 94%, and 100%, and for lymph node involvement were 100%, 81%, and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A nodule or stricture noted by endoscopy was associated with an increased likelihood of submucosal invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, EUS detected otherwise unsuspected submucosal invasion and lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients should be evaluated with EUS when nonoperative therapy is contemplated </plain></SENT>
