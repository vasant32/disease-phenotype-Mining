<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 gene, mapped on chromosome 9p21, is presumed to be the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene localized in this chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine, in 26 Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinomas</z:hpo> of the esophagus, the prevalence of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 9 by typing of microsatellite loci and mutation of p16 by direct sequencing of exons 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allelic losses were found in 69% of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, but only a microdeletion in exon 1 of p16 occurred in 1 tumor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinomas</z:hpo>, 65% had allelic losses and 5 tumors were mutated on the p16 gene (1 deletion, 3 nucleotide substitutions and 1 insertion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relatively low rate of p16 mutation observed here coupled with the high frequency of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 9 suggests that one or several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene(s) distinct from p16 may be the target(s) of allelic deletion in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> or that p16 is inactivated in another way </plain></SENT>
