<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Complete reversal of Barrett's epithelium (BE) achieved by treatment with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) is variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of high-power APC in a multicenter trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In seven study centers, 60 patients (mean age 57, range 27-77) with nonneoplastic BE (length 1-8 cm) were recruited for treatment with high-power APC (90 W) in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> 80 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Video endoscopy, chromoendoscopy, and four-quadrant biopsies (4QB) were carried out during baseline endoscopy and regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of ablation was classified as complete remission (CR), partial remission, or minor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-one of the 60 patients completed ablation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients were lost to follow-up (FU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a mean of 2.6 APC sessions (range 1-5) and a mean FU of 14 months (range 12-32), CR was achieved in 37 of 48 patients (77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major complications occurred in five of 51 patients (9.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Complete ablation of BE can be achieved in a high percentage of patients even in a multicenter design using high-power APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, APC has a relevant morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, ablation of nonneoplastic BE cannot be recommended generally because incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in BE is low </plain></SENT>
