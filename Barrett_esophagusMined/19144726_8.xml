<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Modifiable risk factors for BE are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether vegetable and fruit intakes are associated with BE risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In a case-control study based in western Washington State, we compared the vegetable and fruit intakes of 170 patients with newly diagnosed BE with those of 182 controls from the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relations between vegetable and fruit intakes and BE were examined by using unconditional logistic regression to compute odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% CIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants in the second (adjusted OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.71) and third (adjusted OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.63) tertiles of vegetable intake appeared to have a lower risk of BE (P for trend = 0.048) than did participants in the first tertile of vegetable intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, participants in the second (adjusted OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.86) and third (adjusted OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.75) tertiles of combined vegetable and fruit intakes had a lower risk of BE (P for trend = 0.047) than did participants in the first tertile of vegetable and fruit intakes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in subanalyses limited to patients with visible and with long-segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results support previous findings that increased intakes of vegetables and of vegetables and fruit are associated with a lower risk of BE in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective data that examine relations between diet and BE are needed </plain></SENT>
