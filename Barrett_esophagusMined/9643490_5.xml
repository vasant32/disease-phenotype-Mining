<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three pathologists reviewed endoscopic biopsy specimens and one surgical specimen derived from 102 subjects in a prospective follow-up series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was graded as negative, indefinite, low grade and high grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p53 staining was assessed as negative, weak or patchy and strong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kappa coefficients for interobserver agreement for the three combinations of observer pairs were moderate to substantial (0.48, 0.55 and 0.68) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and substantial to near perfect (0.77, 0.82 and 0.89) for p53 immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the consensus grading achieved for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, strong p53 staining was recorded in 0/79 samples that were negative or indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 5/15 (33%) examples of low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 7/8 (87%) examples of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-dysplastic p53 positive glands were seen in specimens from two subjects harbouring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two p53 positive specimens were, upon review and discussion, re-assigned from low- to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that p53 immunohistochemistry facilitates the interpretation of Barrett's epithelium but need only be employed to confirm a suspected diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and assist with the distinction between low- and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
