<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study prospectively analyzed the endoscopic and histological prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and the risk factors for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> among patients being treated in an endoscopy unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 474 unselected patients (58% men; mean age 52 y) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two biopsy specimens each were taken from below and above the squamocolumnar junction and from the antrum and gastric body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four-quadrant biopsies were taken every 1-2 cm to confirm a macroscopic suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was suspected at endoscopy in 109 patients (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 109 patients with endoscopically suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, only 46 (42%) had the finding confirmed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity for the endoscopic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were 62% and 84%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multivariate logistic regression analysis identified age (P = 0.0001; odds ratio per life-year 1.087; 95% CI, 1.046-1.139), male sex (P = 0.0020; OR 6.346; 95% CI, 2.094-22.314), and the number of biopsies (P = 0.0025; OR 1.661; 95% CI, 1.247-2.392) as factors associated with evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The striking discrepancy between the endoscopic findings and the histological diagnosis may be due to the focal distribution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This emphasizes the importance of an adequate biopsy protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, better methods of detecting focal islands of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> that are not visible at conventional endoscopy are needed </plain></SENT>
