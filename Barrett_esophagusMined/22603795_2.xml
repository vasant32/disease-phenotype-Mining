<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a human metaplastic condition that is the only known precursor to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BE is characterized by a posterior intestinal-like phenotype in an anterior organ and therefore it is reminiscent of homeotic transformations, which can occur in transgenic animal models during embryonic development as a consequence of mutations in HOX genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, acquired deregulation of HOX genes during adulthood has been linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>; however, little is known about their role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant conditions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that HOX genes may be implicated in the development of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that three midcluster HOXB genes (HOXB5, HOXB6, and HOXB7) are overexpressed in BE, compared with the anatomically adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus and gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The midcluster HOXB gene signature in BE is identical to that seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of these three genes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal cells in vitro induces markers of intestinal differentiation, such as KRT20, MUC2, and VILLIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In BE-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the activation midcluster HOXB gene is associated with loss of H3K27me3 and gain of AcH3, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> posttranslational modifications correlate with specific chromatin decompaction at the HOXB locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that epigenetically regulated alterations of HOX gene expression can trigger changes in the transcriptional program of adult esophageal cells, with implications for the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
