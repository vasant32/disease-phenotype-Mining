<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impairment of one or more components of this complex is associated with poor differentiation and increased invasiveness of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By means of immunohistochemistry, the expression of E-cadherin and alpha- and beta-catenin was studied in 65 oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and 15 lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of these proteins was evaluated with respect to clinico-pathological parameters and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of the proteins was strongly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, reduced expression of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was found in 74, 60, and 72 per cent, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of E-cadherin and alpha-catenin correlated significantly with stage and grade of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, whereas expression of beta-catenin correlated only with grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three proteins correlated with shorter patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to grade, E-cadherin and beta-catenin were significant prognosticators for survival, independent of disease stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, decreased expression of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin are related events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, expression of at least E-cadherin and beta-catenin is significantly correlated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
