<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two biopsies were gastric and 25 esophageal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> noninflamed mucosa, 14 reactive glandular changes, eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, ten low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and 11 high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean number of nucleolar organizer regions was 14.9 for high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 10.9 for low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 8.5 for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 6.7 for reactive changes, and 3.9 for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference between high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and the other groups was significant (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the difference between high and low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was not significant (P = 0.06), and there was an overlap between reactive and high grade dysplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that although nucleolar organizer counts correlate with the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the technique is of limited practical use </plain></SENT>
