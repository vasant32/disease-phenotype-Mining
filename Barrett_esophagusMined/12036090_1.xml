<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors have analyzed the intestinal aspects present in areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> in a population of patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> to better understand the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and histogenesis of the proliferating elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Columnar-lined mucosa was studied in 35 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Columnarsurface cells displayed a wide spectrum of ultrastructural features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Well-differentiated columnar secretory cells, secretory-absorptive cells, poorly differentiated columnar cells, atypical columnar cells, and goblet cells were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Well-differentiated absorptive cells were never found, These results demonstrate that the areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> show a wide spectrum of ultrastructural phenotypes, ranging from poorly to well-differentiated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, true enterocytes were not found and the most represented phenotype is that of secretory-absorptive cells, whose principal characteristic is the presence of secretory and absorptive aspects together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They can be described as secretory enterocytes or cells with double specialization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, similar cells were not previously described in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal mucosa, and ultrastructural studies are consistent in describing a broad spectrum of ultrastructural features, suggesting that Barrett's specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is derived from cells with the capacity for a wide range of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, despite the wide use of term <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the medical literature, experimental data clearly failed to detect enterocytes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e>, and ultrastructural data do not support the concept of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> seems to be the result of a "phenotypic shift" of undifferentiated elements, which show a different pattern of evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The result of this process is the formation of new cell types dissimilar from those normally present in esophageal, gastric, or duodenal mucosa </plain></SENT>
