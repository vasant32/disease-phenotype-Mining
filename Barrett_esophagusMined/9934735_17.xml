<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The best treatment approach for patients with documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is currently no well designed prospective study examining the effect of successful antireflux surgery on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients with histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent standard antireflux surgery followed by careful endoscopic, histological, and symptomatic follow-up beginning at 2-4 wk after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative symptoms, patient functional assessment scores, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and 24-h pH studies were compared, in addition to monitoring patients for evidence of squamous re-epithelialization and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in symptoms, functional assessment scores, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and 24-h pH assessments after antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had complete disappearance of short segments (2 and 3 cm) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten additional patients demonstrated evidence of squamous re-epithelialization, although biopsies often showed mixed components of squamous and columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patients showed progression of dysplastic change, and four patients demonstrated the disappearance of low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> throughout the period of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Successful antireflux surgery can produce at least partial squamous re-epithelialization in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and stabilization or apparent improvement in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in some patients without the need for long term medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Continued long term endoscopic and histologic follow-up is still required in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> after antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
