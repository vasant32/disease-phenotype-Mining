<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the association between goblet elements and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, it was not demonstrated that other columnar cells lineages are not related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities were described in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> adjacent to Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, but it is unknown which metaplastic lineages are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This work assessed the frequency and the type of chromosomal abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and performed the identification of the metaplastic cells carrying chromosomal gains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> biopsies were collected and processed for short-term cell culture and cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined immunofluorescence/fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed in cases exhibiting chromosomal gains by using antisera against intestinal (MUC2) and gastric (MUC5AC and MUC6) apomucins and chromosome pericentromeric alpha satellite DNA probes for the chromosomes involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each case was scored for the number of spots (0, 1, 2, &gt;2) in 200 nonoverlapping nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Columnar and goblet cells were separately assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Short-term cell cultures were achieved in 40/60 cases (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were clonal abnormalities in 27/40 cases (68%) and tetraploid (4n) clones in 10/40 (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Structural alterations were detected in 14/40 (35%) with recurrent breakpoints at 1q21, 15q15 and 15q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Numerical changes (<z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> 7 and 18 and loss of Y) occurred in 16/40 (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Gains of chromosomes 7 and 18 were more frequent in columnar than in goblet cells (9.8% vs 0.7% (P&lt;0.05)) and (7.9 vs 1.9% (P&lt;0.05)) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These alterations were detected in cells exhibiting gastric as well as intestinal features and were more frequent in cells without apomucin production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: (1) <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> is a common finding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>(2) The two metaplastic populations are committed, chromosomal gains being more frequent in columnar nongoblet than in goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>(3) The two metaplastic phenotypes, gastric and intestinal, are equally involved </plain></SENT>
