<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Biopsy specimens obtained from the gastro-oesophageal junction can reveal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in patients presenting for routine upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The site of biopsy may play a critical role in determining the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> risk of a patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate prospectively the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> risk in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the distal oesophagus or within the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with short segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (SSBO) and cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CIM) were followed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 177 patients with SSBO were identified (mean age 62 years, range 38-82; 91% whites) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty prevalence cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in SSBO were detected: 17 low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), three high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy six patients with CIM were identified (mean age 67 years, range 37-81; 81% whites) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A single prevalence case of LGD in CIM was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow up of 78 SSBO and 34 CIM patients, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> developed in nine (seven LGD, two HGD) with SSBO and in one (LGD) with CIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences between the two groups with respect to age, ethnicity, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> prevalence, and incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Time to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> progression was significantly longer in CIM compared with SSBO patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the five patients with SSBO and HGD, one developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus on follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No HGD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> have been detected over this time period in CIM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> risk is significantly greater in SSBO than in CIM patients, indicating two potentially different clinical processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future studies should separate SSBO from CIM in order to enhance the understanding of the pathophysiology and malignant potential of each entity </plain></SENT>
