<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, known complications of this disease, appear to be less prevalent in Asia than in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We looked for endoscopic and histologic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in Iranian patients with heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During September 2001 to September 2003, endoscopy was done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with heartburn, either lasting longer than 3 months (n=1182) or for 1-3 months but resistant to 4 weeks of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> therapy (n=66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy was taken from columnar-lined mucosa above the GE junction, at 5 cm above the Z line in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>- appearing mucosa, and from any abnormal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1248 patients (mean age 45 [SD 15.5] years, 750 men; duration of heartburn 68 [SD 87.5] months), 960 (66.5%) had erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and 30 (2.4%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, including 10 and 20 with long- and short-segment involvement, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 134 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing mucosa, 122 had histologic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may be less common in Iran than in Western countries, despite presence of severe heartburn and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
