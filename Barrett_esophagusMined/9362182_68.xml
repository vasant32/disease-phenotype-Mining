<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Short segments of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the distal esophagus are being recognized with increasing frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both long and short segments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> can progress to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) for the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus is not yet known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our purpose, therefore, was to determine the frequency with which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> occurs in patients with SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with SSBE were followed prospectively for the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SSBE was defined as &lt;3 cm of Barrett's-appearing epithelium above the gastroesophageal junction at endoscopy, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy as documented by alcian blue stain at pH 2.5 on at least two endoscopic biopsies 6 months apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients had interval upper endoscopy with systematic biopsy of the Barrett's segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-nine SSBE patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean length of Barrett's mucosa was 1.5 +/- 0.1 cm; the mean age of the patients was 63.1 +/- 1.3 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) at initial endoscopy, for a prevalence of 8.5%; none had high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients had follow-up endoscopy over a mean period of 36.9 +/- 5.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five of these patients developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on follow-up, three with LGD and two with HGD, the incidence of any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> being 5.7% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient with HGD that developed during surveillance progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus over a 2-yr period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The other patient with HGD had LGD on follow-up endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Six patients with initial LGD had no evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 8.5% with an incidence of 5.7% per year in this group of SSBE patients, followed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although dysplastic changes may not be identified on follow-up examination, some patients progress to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we recommend surveillance endoscopy and biopsy in patients with SSBE just as in those with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
