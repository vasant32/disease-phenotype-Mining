<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The biggest challenge in endoscopic surveillance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is better detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in mucosa of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> macroscopic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated in vivo miniprobe confocal laser microscopy (CLM) for the detection of invisible Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective two-centre trial in two phases: phase I to establish criteria of Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and phase II to test these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: 296 biopsy sites in 38 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (mean age 62.1 years, 89.5% men, median length of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, 3 cm) were examined with standard high-resolution endoscopy and by miniprobe CLM, with precise matching of CLM recordings to biopsy sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLM image criteria for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> versus neoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were established from 95 biopsies of 15 patients (phase I); these criteria were then prospectively tested on 201 biopsies from the remaining patients without visible focal changes (phase II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 201 CLM video recordings from phase II cases were randomised and blindly evaluated by two gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary endpoints were accuracy values in diagnosing HGIN or early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (EC) on a per-biopsy basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included inter-observer agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> initially defined miniprobe CLM criteria (phase I) were significantly more frequently detected in HGIN/EC sites compared with sites with no or low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (phase II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a per-biopsy analysis, sensitivity and specificity for two independent investigators were 75.0% and 88.8%, and 75.0% and 91.0%, respectively, translating at best into a positive predictive value of 44.4% and a negative predictive value of 98.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inter-observer agreement was good (kappa 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Miniprobe CLM showed a high negative predictive value for the diagnosis of endoscopically invisible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>; sensitivity, however, has still to be improved </plain></SENT>
