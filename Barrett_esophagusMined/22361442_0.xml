<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 2008 and April 2011, 34 patients underwent treatment with RFA (HALO system(Â®)), in a tertiary centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the study, patients were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1 (16 patients of average 60 years old; 14 men, two women) received EMR and RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 2 (18 patients averaging 59 years age; 14 men, four women) received RFA without EMR in the year preceding the RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group 1, high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) was eradicated in 12 cases (92%), low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) in three cases (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete response occurred in nine cases (56%), partial response in 100% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group 2, HGD was eradicated in one patient (100%), LGD in three patients (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A complete response was achieved in eight patients, partial response in four cases (77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The complication rate for groups 1 and 2 was of 18% and 10% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No complication prevented completion of treatment or continued monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was evaluated to 5% in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RFA associated with EMR is feasible, offering probably better results and a very important advantage: a more complete histology before follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our results show effective treatment of BO and associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with a low rate of complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, when new techniques of BO ablation are used, the need to obtain histology before treatment should not be forgotten </plain></SENT>
