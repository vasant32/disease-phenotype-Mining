<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: According to the case-control studies, colon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> are not more frequent as usual in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: Analysis of the relationship of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> with colon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> through a case presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The 62-years old male patient has been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7915">pantoprazole</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e> and histologically proven short-segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7915">Pantoprazole</z:chebi> treatment was started and the patient became symptom-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 1997 colonoscopy was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> and 4 recto-sigmoideal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were removed (tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 4 years of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment, laparoscopic fundoplication was performed but after one year of symptom-free period, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> was started again because of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was followed-up for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histological examinations included also Ki67 and p53 antibody staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On control colonoscopies, small rectal and sigmoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The retrospective histologic examination of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> revealed the increase of Ki-67-positive cells from 2-5% to 45-55% during the 5 years of follow-up, which is higher than the values found in controls and may express the increasing proliferative activity of the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although according to the literature, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> does not increase the risk of colon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, this may occur in individual cases, warranting close follow-up </plain></SENT>
