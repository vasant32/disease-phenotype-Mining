<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have suggested that laser coagulation or photodynamic therapy combined with acid suppression may induce reconstitution of squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a high percentage of residual glands remain in cases treated with both techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) appears to be an attractive alternative to other thermoablative techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the reconstitution of squamous epithelium in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> after APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with histologically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were included in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After base-line documentation by videotaping and biopsies, Barrett's epithelium was treated by repeated APC at intervals of 4-6 weeks until complete squamous restoration was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were kept under high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 13 patients complete reconstitution of squamous epithelium was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Buried glands after squamous restoration were detected transiently in only one case after the first session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As side effects seven patients had mild retrosternal discomfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient reported severe retrosternal pain for 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>He then refused further APC sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Another patient was excluded because of noncompliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period (6-13 months) recurrence of Barrett's epithelium was observed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: APC is a suitable technique for achieving squamous restoration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The rare occurrence of remaining buried glands may result from the homogeneous coagulation achieved by the ionized <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> gas beam </plain></SENT>
