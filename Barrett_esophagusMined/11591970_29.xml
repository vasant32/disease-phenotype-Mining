<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed our experience with 1,000 consecutive patients receiving laparoscopic fundoplication for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (n = 882) or paraesophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> (n = 118) between October 1991 and July 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> and failed fundoplication were excluded from analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were evaluated preoperatively by upper endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> swallow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 1994, 24-h pH monitoring was performed selectively in patients with extraesophageal symptoms and/or those without erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 490 men 510 women in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 49 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Procedures performed were 360 degrees floppy fundoplication (n = 879), 360 degrees fundoplication without fundus mobilization (Rossetti) (n = 22), 270 degrees posterior fundoplication (n = 96), and anterior fundoplication (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophageal lengthening procedure (Collis gastroplasty) was performed in combination with fundoplication in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In seven patients the treatment was converted to open fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES: The average length of hospitalization was 2.2 days, and 136 patients stayed longer than 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Major complications occurred in 21 patients: esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (n= 10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> paraesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> (n = 4), splenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (n = 3), and testicular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional operations were required to manage the complications in 14 patients (70%): Four of these procedures were performed emergently, and 10 patients underwent reoperation between 6 h and 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which involved elderly patients with paraesophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were 35 late failures requiring reoperation for recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> or development of new symptoms: The treatment of 32 patients was revised laparoscopically, and 4 patients required laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Beyond 1 year (median follow-up period, 27 months), 94% of the reviewed patients were satisfied with their surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
