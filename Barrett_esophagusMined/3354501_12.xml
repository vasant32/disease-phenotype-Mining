<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the efficacy of cytopathology in identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, observations were compared on 150 esophageal cytology samples with concurrent endoscopic biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six specimens that contained benign columnar epithelium in either cytologic or biopsy material were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distinctive-type Barrett mucosa with incomplete intestinalization, considered diagnostic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, was found in 34 of 66 cases (52%) and was present only in cytologic material in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two specimens contained cardiac-type mucosa (present only in cytology in ten cases), a finding of uncertain significance due to lack of localization of the sample with respect to the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fundic-type mucosa was not observed in any specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two cases of distinctive-type Barrett mucosa with columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath> were identified in both biopsy and cytology specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among eight Barrett-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (seven <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and one squamous), cytologic material was diagnostic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in seven and highly suspicious in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that cytopathologic studies are a useful adjunct to biopsy histopathology in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The role of cytopathology in the diagnosis of Barrett-related columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath> requires further study, and at present a cautious approach with biopsy confirmation is recommended </plain></SENT>
