<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reversible hearing loss is a recognized toxicity of DFMO that usually occurs at doses above 2 g/m(2)/d, and generally when the cumulative dose exceeds 250 g/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a recently completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> chemoprevention trial, a participant developed a 15-dB decrease in hearing at frequencies of 250, 2,000, and 3,000 Hz in the right ear and a &gt; or =20-dB decrease in hearing at 4,000 to 6,000 Hz in the left ear after taking 0.5 g/m(2)/d DFMO for approximately 13 weeks (cumulative dose of 45 g/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
