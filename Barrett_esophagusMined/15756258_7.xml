<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present work was to investigate the expression of CD1a in a series of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM), gastric type (GTBM), with and without follow-up, in order to analyse whether its expression may help to diagnose this disease and to address the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, GTBM may be confused sometimes with islets of ectopic gastric mucosa and its evolution towards <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (Dy) or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (Ca) could not be foreseen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We showed a significant higher expression of CD1a in GTBM than in both Dy and Ca; nevertheless, the number of positive GTBM was significantly lower in the group of cases that at follow-up underwent Dy or Ca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data address that CD1a may be a novel biomarker for BM and that its expression may help to predict the prognosis of this pathology </plain></SENT>
