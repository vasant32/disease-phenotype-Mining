<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Locally advanced and metastatic Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> account for the majority of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> entity at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many studies have shown that a multimodal therapy concept consisting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by resection can result in improved long-term survival in patients responding to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The benefit of a multimodal therapy concept in patients with stage IV disease remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 178 patients with Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> who underwent multimodal therapy with resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathological staging and the clinical course of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, who were treated equally, were compared to patients with locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, postoperative pathological staging showed that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> have a more advanced T- and N-status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the histopathological response according to Becker showed a chemoresistence in 84% of cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, whereas 54% of patients with locally advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> had a good response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was poor, with 9 months in the metastatic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to compare the outcome of a modern multimodal therapy concept in patients with metastatic Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in comparison to patients with the locally advanced form of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are profound differences in the two groups with regard to survival time and response rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of the poor outcome to date, multimodal therapy with resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in stage IV disease cannot be recommended </plain></SENT>
