<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The reported frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in patients with reflux symptoms varies from 5% to 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact frequency of long-segment BE (LSBE) (&gt;3 cm) and short-segment BE (SSBE) (&lt;3 cm) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of LSBE and SSBE in consecutive patients presenting for a first endoscopic evaluation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> as the indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting to the endoscopy unit of a Veterans Affairs Medical Center for a first upper endoscopy with the indication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic information (gender, race, age), data on tobacco use and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e>, and body mass index (BMI) were recorded for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before endoscopy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients completed a validated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of BE was based on the presence of columnar-appearing mucosa in the distal esophagus, with confirmation by demonstration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> on the initial endoscopy underwent a second endoscopy to document healing and to rule-out underlying BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with a history of BE, alarm symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, evidence of GI <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>), or prior endoscopy were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 378 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (94% men, 86% white; median age 56 years, range 27-93 years) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of BE was made in 50 patients (13.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) was 1.0 cm (range 0.5-15.0 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with BE, 64% had short-segment BE (SSBE) (overall SSBE frequency 8.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall frequency of long-segment BE (LSBE) was 4.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was detected in 62% of the patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of the 50 patients with BE (median age 62 years, range 29-81 years), 47 (94%) were men and 98% were white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (36%) were using tobacco at the time of endoscopy; 23 (46%) were former users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The median body mass index (BMI) of patients with BE was 27.3 (overweight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between patients with LSBE and SSBE with respect to age, gender, ethnicity, BMI, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptom duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of BE in a high-risk patient group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, majority white men, age &gt; 50 years) who sought medical attention is 13.2%, with the majority (64%) having SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the frequency of BE in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> has not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The true prevalence of BE in the general population, including those who do not seek care, is undoubtedly lower, currently and historically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients with BE are overweight and have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Demographic data for patients with LSBE and SSBE are similar, indicating that these are a continuum of the same process </plain></SENT>
