<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The few studies that have previously investigated HPV and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) or BE have produced either negative data or positive results of doubtful clinical/etiological significance or have detected only low-risk HPV types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore prospectively determined the prevalence of biologically active HPV in esophageal epithelium of patients representing the Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence.METHODS:HPV DNA was estimated by nested PCR and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transcriptional activity detected by E6/7 oncogene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and p16INK4A immunohistochemistry in fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded esophageal biopsies of patients with BE, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (BD), and EAC, as well as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were obtained from the transformation zone (squamocolumnar junction (SCJ)) and the lesion, or corresponding site in controls, i.e., 2â€‰cm above the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ).RESULTS:Of the 261 patients, 81 were positive for HPV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In controls and BE, the virus was mostly detected at the transformation zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls (18.0%), HPV positivity was significantly more common in BD (68.6%, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.78-4.85, P&lt;0.001) and EAC (66.7%, IRR 2.87, 95% CI 1.69-4.86, P&lt;0.001), but not in BE (22.1%, IRR 1.06, 95% CI 0.60-1.85, P=0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 92.6% were high-risk (HR) HPV, i.e., types 16 and 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Again, p16INK4A positivity was greatest in BD and EAC and much less in BE patients (44.1%, IRR 17.0 (95% CI 4.86-59.6, P&lt;0.001), 44.4%, 17.0 (95% CI 4.87-59.4, P&lt;0.001), and 10.6%, 3.93 (95% CI 1.01-15.3, P=0.048) respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 66 HPV DNA-positive patients tested for E6/E7 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, none of the control (n=16) or BE (n=13) individuals were positive, whereas 9/22 BD and 9/15 EAC patients demonstrated oncogene expression (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When HPV DNA, p16INK4A, and E6/E7 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positive, there was a very strong association with disease severity (SCJ: odds ratio (OR) 104, 95% CI 20.3-529, P&lt;0.001; lesion: OR 62.2, 95% CI 12.4-311, P&lt;0.001) than when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were negative.CONCLUSIONS:Transcriptionally active HR-HPV was strongly associated with BD and EAC, but was largely biologically irrelevant in BE and controls, suggesting a potential role in esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
