<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Introduction: The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The wide variation in symptoms is a major reason for the controversies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> varies from nonerosive reflux disease over <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory disease</z:e>, it is clear that not one investigation technique will provide an answer in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Areas covered: Relevant literature published in PubMed and CINAHL and recent guidelines were collected and reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic tests were evaluated by the following criteria: ability to confirm a diagnosis, to exclude other diagnoses with similar presentation, to detect complications, to predict disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expert opinion: Multiple intraluminal impedance (MII) is extensively evaluated in recent years, but other new techniques and measurements were also developed, mainly to diagnose extra-esophageal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although evidence for a "relation" between GER and extra-esophageal symptoms is demonstrated, the "causality" between both is not proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MII measures in a reliable reproducible way non-acid or weakly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, as long as medical therapeutic options are limited to anti-acid medications, MII lacks therapeutic implications, and therefore clinical impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since investigations for GER are invasive or cause irradiation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges cannot be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the "old" techniques remain the standard diagnostic tools: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> meal for <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, endoscopy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and pH monitoring to demonstrate a time relation between (acid) GER and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MII provides more information than pH monitoring, but is more expensive and has limited therapeutic impact as long as drugs are mainly "anti-acid." </plain></SENT>
