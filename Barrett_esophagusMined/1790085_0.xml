<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 12,450 upper digestive endoscopies done in the past 7 years, 945 instances of peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> have been diagnosed (7.59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 172 cases of endobrachiesophagus (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) were detected (1.38% of the entire endoscopy series and 18.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty two of th 172 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were diagnosed as having <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (12.79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a frequent complication of peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and as the possibilities of malignant changes are as high as 12.79 it should be considered as a precancerous lesion and monitored as such </plain></SENT>
