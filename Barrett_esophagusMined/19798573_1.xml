<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is not known whether there have been recent changes in demographic or clinical characteristics among patients newly diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), which could be a result of changes in disease epidemiology or of screening or surveillance effects, and could have clinical implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine whether there has been a shift in age at diagnosis of BE over the past decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondary aims were to determine whether there has been a shift in patient body mass index (BMI) or BE segment length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An endoscopic database at a tertiary medical center was used to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) performed between 1997 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cohort was restricted to patients newly diagnosed with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathology records were reviewed to confirm biopsy findings of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE was diagnosed in 378 subjects between 1997 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age at diagnosis of BE was 60.7 +/- 14.1 years, with mean BMI of 27.4 +/- 5.2 kg/m(2) and mean BE segment length of 4.7 +/- 3.7 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Between 1997 and 2007 there was no significant change in mean age at diagnosis, BMI, BE segment length or in proportion of men versus women newly diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite an increase in volume of EGDs performed in an open-access endoscopy unit between 1997 and 2007, there was no appreciable shift in age at diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BMI and BE segment length among newly diagnosed patients also remained stable over this time period </plain></SENT>
