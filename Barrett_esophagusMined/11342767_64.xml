<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A distinctive type of multilayered epithelium (ME) has been described at the neo-squamocolumnar junction and within columnar mucosa in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This epithelium has morphologic and ultrastructural features of both squamous and columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multilayered epithelium may represent an early or intermediate stage of columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>; therefore, we performed this study to determine the morphologic and biologic characteristics of this epithelium and to gain insight into its derivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Esophageal mucosal biopsies containing ME from 17 patients with BE were evaluated morphologically, stained with a variety of mucin histochemical stains; and also immunostained with antibodies against cytokeratins (CK) 13 (squamous epithelium marker); 14 (basal squamous epithelium marker) 7, 8/18, 19, and 20 (columnar epithelium markers), MIB-1 (proliferation marker); villin (intestinal brush border protein); and TGFalpha, EGFR, pS2, and hSP (enteric proliferation/differentiation regulatory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous epithelium, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric cardia epithelium, specialized-type intestinal epithelium (BE), and esophageal mucosal and submucosal gland duct epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multilayered epithelium expressed a pattern of mucin production (neutral mucin, sialomucin, and sulfomucin in 88%, 100%, and 71% of cases, respectively) and cytokeratin expression (CK 13 and 19 in the basal "squamoid" cells, CK 7, 8/18, 19, and 20 in the superficial "columnar" cells) similar to that of columnar epithelium in BE, and showed a high capacity for cellular proliferation (Ki-67-positive in 88% of cases) and differentiation (TGFalpha, EGFR, pS2 and villin-positive in 100%, 100%, 93%, and 66% of cases, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mucosal gland duct epithelium showed a similar phenotypic pattern and, in one case, was seen to give rise to ME at the surface of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that ME represents an early or intermediate stage in the development of esophageal columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mucosal gland duct epithelium may contain progenitor cells that can give rise to ME </plain></SENT>
