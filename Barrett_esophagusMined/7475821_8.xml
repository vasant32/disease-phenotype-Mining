<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> may be at increased risk of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, though the association is disputed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a multicentre prospective study we compared the prevalence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> patients (n = 104) had histological confirmation of columnar epithelium extending more than 3 cm above the gastro-oesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 537 controls were patients with symptoms suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No participant had a personal history of colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologically proven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were found in 26 Barrett's patients (25%) and 75 controls (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were discovered in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> was greater in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.01) but the relation became non-significant after adjustment for age and sex and control for other known risk factors by a logistic regression model (odds ratio 1.4 [0.7-2.7]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was significantly higher in patients older than 59 than in younger patients (2.2 [1.3-3.5]) and in men than in women (3.4 [2.0-5.7]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other factors contributing significantly to the risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> were a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (2.3 [1.1-4.8]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> (2.1 [1.1-3.9]), previous colonic investigation (0.3 [0.1-0.7]), and complete as opposed to partial colonoscopy (6.4 [0.8-48.3]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is not an independent risk factor for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and, therefore, is not, in itself an indication for colorectal screening </plain></SENT>
