<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the frequency of mutations in the mtDNA D-Loop region in 20 patients with Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and associated Barrett's epithelium by automated DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations were detected in eight of 20 (40%) patients in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In six of eight positive cases, the mutations were detected only in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, one of eight showed mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and Barrett's epithelium, and one of eight only in Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's epithelium was classified low-grade in one and high grade in the two specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no association of mtDNA D-Loop mutations with histopathological stage of disease or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present the first study of frequent occurrence of mutations in the mtDNA D-Loop regions in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study supports the hypothesis that oxidative damage might be a mechanism for the induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since mutations were identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated dysplastic Barrett's epithelium, they also might become a marker for the malignant potential of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
