<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aspirate contained markedly atypical clustered large cells that displayed prominent nucleoli and mitoses, as well as lymphoid cells, suggestive of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> metastatic to a lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic-appearing cells were, in fact, dysplastic glandular cells that the needle traversed en route to a reactive lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The case represents a rare instance in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was discerned on fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) biopsy and highlights a potential pitfall in FNA </plain></SENT>
