<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enzyme activity ranged from 0 (less than detectable) to more than 0.5 unit/mg protein in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_605'>metaplastic tissue</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, neither <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">spermidine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> (as individual parameters), nor total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> contents were related to <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> activity in the individual patient biopsies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, cell strains derived from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_605'>metaplastic tissue</z:mpath> were growth inhibited by alpha-difluoromethylornithine, an enzyme-activated, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> inhibitor of <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two different cell strains derived from Barrett's epithelium, growth was affected with drug concentrations as low as 0.05 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the mechanism responsible for the elevation in enzyme activity is unknown, the regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> metabolism appears to be altered in this premalignant tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The growth inhibition of Barrett's epithelium-derived cell lines by <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> inhibitors suggests a potential role for these compounds in the treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
