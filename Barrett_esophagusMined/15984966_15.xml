<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have confirmed that gastroesophageal symptoms are highly prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, studies linking epidemiology with clinical or chart data are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the frequency of endoscopy and endoscopic findings, as well as predictors of health-care utilization, among people with reflux symptoms in the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A previous survey of 2,118 Olmsted County, MN, residents in 1993 identified 242 subjects with frequent reflux symptoms (at least weekly) who received care at a medical center in the county </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were abstracted from Mayo Clinic records between 1988 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 130 of the 242 (54%, 95% CI 47-60%) had sought care for reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (10%) had visited a gastroenterologist; 47 (19%) had an upper endoscopy (EGD), 64 (26%) had an upper GI X-ray, and one had an ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was detected in 4 (9%) of those having an EGD and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was found in one patient with Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (5%) died, but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age, higher education, frequent heartburn, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significant, independent predictors of consulting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although many people in the community have frequent reflux symptoms, few have investigations, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were unrelated to reflux disease or its complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Data from referral clinic or endoscopy series should not be extrapolated to the large numbers of people in the community with symptoms of reflux </plain></SENT>
