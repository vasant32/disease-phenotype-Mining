<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the values of fine mucosal patterns and the capillary patterns observed by magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging (MENBI) for the detection of SIM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> and superficial Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also undertook a histologic investigation regarding whether the capillary pattern observed by MENBI corresponds to the 3-dimensional (3D) structure of the capillary as depicted by using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (CLSM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: To compare the findings of MENBI, at 217 sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e>, with histologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Capillaries of the superficial mucosal layer were observed and were analyzed by 3D with a CLSM in 45 biopsied specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Fifty-eight patients, including 4 with superficial Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Jikei University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Upon observation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sites were classified as irregular patterns in both the fine mucosal patterns and capillary patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most characteristic endoscopic patterns of SIM were revealed to be the cerebriform fine mucosal pattern (sensitivity, 56%; specificity, 79%; odds ratio, 4.78) and ivy- or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (DNA)-like capillary pattern (sensitivity, 77%; specificity, 94%; odds ratio, 51.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The addition of capillary patterns to fine mucosal patterns improved the accuracy of diagnosing SIM (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MENBI was able to precisely visualize the structure of capillaries in the superficial mucosal layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The addition of capillary patterns to fine mucosal patterns appeared to improve the diagnostic value for detecting SIM and superficial Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> upon observation by MENBI </plain></SENT>
