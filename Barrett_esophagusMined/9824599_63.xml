<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess whether restoration of squamous epithelium can be obtained after ablation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> using <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty one patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> received APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">Omeprazole</z:chebi> (40 mg/day) was given from the first APC application to one month after completion of the treatment, then given symptomatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty four hour pH-metry was performed during endotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete re-epithelialisation was visualised at endoscopy in 25/31 patients (81%) after a mean number of 2.4 APC sessions (range 1-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only partial squamous re-epithelialisation was observed in three patients and three others had no eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At histological assessment, eradication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was only confirmed in 19/31 patients (61%) due to the presence of a few residual Barrett's glands under the new squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete eradication was related to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> segment length of less than 4 cm and the absence of circumferential extension but not to the normalisation of oesophageal acid exposure under <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with apparently complete endoscopic and histological eradication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were re-evaluated at one year; eight (47%) disclosed relapsing islands of Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> despite continuous <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> therapy (10-40 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: APC combined with 40 mg <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> daily can eradicate Barrett's mucosa with apparent squamous re-epithelialisation in the majority of patients even in the absence of normalisation of oesophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, one year after endotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, relapse is frequent but limited in extent </plain></SENT>
