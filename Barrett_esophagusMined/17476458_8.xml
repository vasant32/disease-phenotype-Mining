<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase (GST) enzymes play an important role in cellular protection against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and toxic foreign chemicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the hypothesis that polymorphisms in genes for these detoxifying enzymes could influence susceptibility to RE and BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 loci were analyzed by PCR-based methods in 64 patients with RE (and an additional group of 22 subjects with BE as the fourth grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>) and 173 unrelated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the distributions of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes between the controls and patients with RE or BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, frequencies of GSTP1 alleles were non-significantly different between the control and RE groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, GSTP1 B allele carriers were more frequent among the patients with BE compared to those in the reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> group (P=0.04, OR=2.10, 95% CI 0.99-4.44) and most significantly when compared to the controls (P=0.0067, Pcorr&lt;0.05, OR=2.56, 95%CI 1.30-5.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes did not show any relationship with reflux disease, the GSTP1 gene might be one of the risk factors associated with susceptibility to RE, especially to BE </plain></SENT>
