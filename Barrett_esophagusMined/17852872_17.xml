<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that only patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> are at risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, but the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines suggest that glandular mucosa is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> that is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to quantify the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in columnar-lined lower oesophagus, with or without specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who had endoscopic biopsies of the lower oesophagus between 1980 and 1994 in a single-centre teaching hospital were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> histological specimens were re-examined and reported according to whether they contained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar epithelial-lined lower oesophagus</z:e>, glandular mucosa, with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 712 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 379 (55.1%) were found to have specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM), and the remaining 309 (44.9%, p = NS) were reported as having glandular mucosa (GM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up for patients was 12 years (range 8-20 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients went on to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (4.1%) during the follow-up period - 17 in the SIM group (4.5%) and 11 in the GM group (3.6%, p =NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The oesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> rate was 0.34% per year (SIM 0.37%, GM 0.30%; p =NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have glandular mucosa on biopsy without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> have a similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk to those with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
