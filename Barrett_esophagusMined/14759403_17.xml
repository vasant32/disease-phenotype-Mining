<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To review our early operative results and endoscopic findings after laparoscopic fundoplication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1995 through December 2000, 49 patients with BE (35 men and 14 women) underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age was 54 years (range, 28 to 85 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No patient had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; 6, however, had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 49 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heartburn was present in 41 patients (84%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in 16 (33%), epigastric or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> in 9 (18%), and other symptoms in 16 (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Nissen fundoplication was performed in 48 patients and a partial posterior fundoplication in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients (84%) had concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 2 patients (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was complete in 48 patients (98%) and ranged from 1 to 81 months (median, 29 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Functional results were classified as excellent in 33 patients (69%), good in 9 (19%), fair in 5 (10%), and poor in 1 (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients (67%) underwent postoperative surveillance esophagoscopy with biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (18%) had total regression of BE and 3 (6%) had a decrease in total length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the 6 patients with preoperative low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was not found in 4, remained unchanged in 1, and progressed to in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic fundoplication is effective in controlling symptoms in the majority of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>While disappearance of BE may occur in some patients, the possibility of developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is not eliminated by laparoscopic fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Therefore, endoscopic surveillance should continue </plain></SENT>
