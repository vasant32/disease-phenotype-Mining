<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antennas had a diameter of up to 3.3 mm and various lengths between 20 and 37 mm; these were designed to operate at 915 MHz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sets of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) formers were constructed to improve the repeatability and reproducibility of the helix manufacture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Small diameter copper wire was wound over the formers and connected to the coaxial cable at the inner and outer conductor junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The power deposition profiles of the antennas were measured in a muscle-equivalent phantom using an infrared camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of antenna length and coil spacing were characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was observed that uniform temperature profiles along the antenna length were achieved with a length of wire of 99 mm +/- 2 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effective heating length (length of the antenna that exhibits &gt; 50% of the maximum temperature rise) was comparable to the antenna length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The radial penetration depth of 50% of the antenna surface temperature for the optimum 20 mm antenna was 2.5 mm from the antenna outer surface </plain></SENT>
