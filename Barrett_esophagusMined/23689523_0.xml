<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is a clinical need for biomarkers that can improve diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification of esophageal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we review the current literature and highlight the most important, recent advancements in biomarkers as a supplement to histopathology for management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: A prospective cohort study in Northern Ireland shows that a small panel of biomarkers (low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, abnormal DNA ploidy and Aspergillus oryzae lectin) can identify patients at high risk for developing high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent research in molecular imaging shows promise for molecular probes in endoscopy, using fluorescently labeled <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> or lectins to identify dysplastic areas of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the current literature, p53 immunostaining is starting to be adopted by some centers as an adjunct to histopathology diagnosis for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The evidence base for the use of biomarkers is increasing and it appears that panels may have superior diagnostic and predictive power over single, candidate biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prior to clinical implementation, biomarkers must overcome significant barriers including the need for large-scale prospective validation trials, and the limited ability of clinical laboratories to process and analyze complex biomarker assays </plain></SENT>
