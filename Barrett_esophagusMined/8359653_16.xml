<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Specialized Barrett's esophageal mucosa, characterized by incomplete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophageal mucosa, is associated with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the intestinal disaccharidase sucrase-isomaltase (SI) has been shown in incomplete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the stomach, it is commonly believed that Barrett's mucosa does not express SI based on the lack of enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine whether the SI gene is expressed in Barrett's epithelium and its associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at the level of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the presence of SI <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cellular localization of SI protein was determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SI <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was identified in 76% of Barrett's epithelium and 82% of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional initiation site for SI in these tissues was identical to that of the small intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical localization showed that SI was directed to the apical membrane in Barrett's epithelium in contrast to a more diffuse cytoplasmic pattern in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Columnar cells of specialized Barrett's epithelium express SI and are, therefore, phenotypically similar to those in incomplete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the stomach with respect to intestinal gene expression </plain></SENT>
