<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the aetiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, a condition in which columnar epithelium replaces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium above the juncture of the oesophagus with the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An exploratory retrospective study of males from the Tucson Veteran's Affairs Medical Center (Tucson, AZ, USA), looking at 22 Barrett's cases and 22 controls, was undertaken to: (1) determine whether risk factors previously reported for squamous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> were also potential risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>; and (2) explore which of several retrospectively determined dietary factors would permit maximum discrimination of Barrett's cases from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the recognized difficulty with retrospective dietary assessment, an intensive interview-based life history approach was developed to assess behavioural factors throughout adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the dose-response relationship involving questions (1) and (2) separately for subjects with lesions less than or greater than 7 cm in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A literature-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> risk factor score (including use of tobacco and intakes of alcohol, fat, vitamin A, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> and protein) discriminated cases from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alcohol consumption alone discriminated patients with lesions &lt; 7 cm in length from controls, and a more complex risk factor score (including tobacco use, alcohol, fat, fruits and vegetables) discriminated patients with lesions &gt; 7 cm in length from controls </plain></SENT>
