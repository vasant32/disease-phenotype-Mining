<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After esophagectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, the first choice for reconstruction of the gastrointestinal continuity is by gastric tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When this is not feasible, a reconstruction by colon interposition can be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life in patients at least 6 months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> resection and colon interposition without signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with previously published data of patients after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> resection and gastric tube reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1993 and January 2002, 36 patients underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> resection and gastrointestinal reconstruction by colon interposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A one-time Quality of Life assessment was carried out in 14 patients who were still disease free after a median follow-up of 21 months (mean 35, range 7-97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were visited at home and asked to fill in questionnaires which consisted of the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey to assess general quality of life, an adapted Rotterdam Symptom Checklist to assess disease-specific quality of life, a visual analogue scale, and an additional questionnaire concerning other specific effects of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 14 patients returned the completed set of questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to the previously published results of patients after gastric tube reconstruction patients with a colon interposition scored significantly (P &lt; or = 0.05) lower in five of the eight subscales of the SF-36 questionnaire (i.e. general health, physical role, vitality, social functioning, and mental health) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent symptoms measured by the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist were early satiety after a meal, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, loss of sexual interest, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients could not independently run their housekeeping and four patients still needed artificial enteral nutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on the SF-36 questionnaire, patients after colon interposition by necessity have a poor general quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Even long after the operation they have a broad spectrum of persisting symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prior to surgery, patients should be informed about the disabling long-term functional outcome of a colon interposition </plain></SENT>
