<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, including esophagoscopy, is the procedure of choice to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of unsedated ultrathin esophagoscopy (UUE) has been reported by gastroenterologists in specialized endoscopy units and otolaryngologists in outpatient otolaryngology offices, but UUE has not been previously described in a primary care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examines the feasibility of office-based UUE in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is a retrospective chart review in a university-based family medicine clinic in the southeastern United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Charts were reviewed of 56 adult outpatients who were referred for further evaluation of reflux symptoms that persisted after at least 4 weeks of therapy with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>(2) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> and who elected to undergo UUE in the primary care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, procedure indications and findings, changes in clinical management, and procedure times were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred percent of patients asked to participate in UUE were willing to undergo the procedure (mean age 48.3 +/- 1.6 y, 57.1% women); 95% of the patients tolerated UUE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 5.7% (n = 3) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean procedure time was 5.5 +/- 1.7 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No complications were reported in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Initial data suggest that UUE is feasible in primary care, with the majority of patients tolerating the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>UUE may be an efficient method of examining the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
