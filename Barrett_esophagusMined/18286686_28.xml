<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: E-cadherin, Slug, Snail and Twist <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> specimens was examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry was used to examine cellular localisation and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of Slug on epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers was examined by transfection of Slug into an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> line OE33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cellular localisation of Slug in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was largely cytoplasmic whilst in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> it was nuclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative analysis indicated that Slug was more abundant in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> compared to matched Barrett's metaplastic specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Snail and Twist were expressed in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> but were cytoplasmic in location and not induced compared to Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations were supported by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> studies where only Slug <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was shown to be over-expressed in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and inversely correlated to E-cadherin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Slug in OE33 mediated E-cadherin repression and induced the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is associated with increased Slug expression and this may represent a mechanism of E-cadherin silencing </plain></SENT>
