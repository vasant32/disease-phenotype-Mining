<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autofluorescence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant tissues was measured directly using a fiberoptic probe inserted through an endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The measurements were performed in vivo during routine endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the fluorescence signal from the tissue was performed using laser excitation at 410 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The methodology was applied to differentiate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this LIF approach were compared with histopathology results of the biopsy samples and indicated excellent agreement in the classification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> for the samples investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LIF procedure could lead to the development of a rapid and cost-effective technique for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
