<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report data from patients with refractory reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> who were undergoing maintenance therapy with &gt;/=20 mg <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> daily for a mean period of 6.5 years (range, 1.4-11.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with severe reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> resistant to long-term therapy with H(2)-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and who were not eligible for surgery were evaluated at least annually for endoscopic relapse and histological changes in the gastric corpus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 230 patients (mean age, 63 years at entry; 36% were &gt;/=70 years), there were 158 relapses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> during 1490 treatment years (1 per 9.4 years), with no significant difference in relapse rates between Helicobacter pylori-positive and -negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients rehealed during continued therapy with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> at the same or higher dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of gastric corpus mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was 4.7% and 0.7% in H. pylori-positive and -negative patients, respectively, which was mainly observed in elderly patients who had moderate/severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> at entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with baseline moderate/severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, the incidences were similar: 7.9% and 8.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corpus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was rare, and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adverse event profile was as might be expected from this elderly group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> therapy (up to 11 years) is highly effective and safe for control of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
