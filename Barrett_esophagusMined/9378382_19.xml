<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> for which screening is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS/METHODS: Annual screening endoscopies have been performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects suitable for surgery for many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the benefits to patients of continuing this policy 10 years' experience of screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 29,374 endoscopies performed over this period, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was present in 1.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an approximate equal sex distribution with the majority of cases being identified in patients over 50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty five per cent of these patients were suitable to enter a yearly screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During screening, the length of oesophagus involved did not vary over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result of 379 endoscopies performed for screening purposes, only one patient was identified as developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> solely as a result of the screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two further patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> identified as a result of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> requiring additional endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> while in the screening programme had "long segment" (&gt; 8 cm) regions of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> with a stricture present at the initial endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The poor yield from this screening programme suggests that the policy should be reconsidered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Resources may be better spent on focusing on patients who present with ulceration or stricture in addition to Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
