<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to report our experience in the surgical management of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between November 1992 and December 2000, 330 consecutive patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagogastric junction were observed in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 105 (31.8%) had Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 12 individuals (11.4%) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was discovered during endoscopic surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with doubtful cleavage planes at preoperative investigation were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 80 patients (76.2%) underwent esophagectomy without operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Ivor Lewis approach was used in 70 patients; of these, 31 underwent extended mediastinal lymph node dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four patients (92.5%) had R0 resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival rate was 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival was significantly associated with stage, lymph node status, and completeness of resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis remains the prerequisite for curative treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An extended mediastinal lymphadenectomy does not increase morbidity, allows precise <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging, and may prove effective in preventing local recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neoadjuvant therapy requires major improvement before it can be unconditionally recommended outside clinical trials </plain></SENT>
