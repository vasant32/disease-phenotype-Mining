<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously these patients have undergone resection, however, the management of patients unsuitable for surgical resection is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the long-term outcome of patients who have undergone endoscopic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> ablation for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (median age, 64 yr; range, 43-85 yr) with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's, who were unfit or had declined surgery, underwent <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> ablation and received follow-up evaluation over 7 years (mean follow-up, 37 mo; range, 7-78 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was stopped once there was no further histologic evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients then went on to receive a surveillance endoscopy at 3, 6, and 12 months after ablation, then annually thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> responded to treatment in 25 patients (86%); 22 of these had complete regression to neosquamous esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up evaluation, no patients died of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, 3 of whom continue with ablation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient died of unrelated causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A single esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> was the only significant adverse event attributable to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> occurred and patients returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activity after 24 hours in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients who received <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> ablation showed no difference in survival to that of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> beam ablation for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is an effective and safe treatment, especially in patients unfit for surgical resection </plain></SENT>
