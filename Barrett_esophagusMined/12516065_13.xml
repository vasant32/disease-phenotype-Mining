<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, these techniques were examined as a potential means of improving the surveillance of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using excitation wavelengths of 337 and 400 nm, 148 fluorescence spectra, and 108 transient decay profiles (at 550 +/- 20 nm) were obtained endoscopically in 37 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Corresponding biopsies were collected and classified as <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, HGD, or low risk tissue (LRT) [non-dysplastic BE, indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IFD</z:e>), and low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic algorithms were developed retrospectively using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to separate LRT from HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LDA produced diagnostic algorithms based solely on spectral data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moderate levels of sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) were obtained for both 337 nm (Se = 74%, Sp = 67%) and 400 nm (Se = 74%, Sp = 85%) excitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the diagnosis of HGD in BE, steady-state fluorescence was more effective than time-resolved data, and excitation at 400 nm excitation was more effective than 337 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While fluorescence-targeted biopsy is approaching clinical usefulness, increased sensitivity to dysplastic changes-possibly through modification of system parameters-is needed to improve accuracy levels </plain></SENT>
