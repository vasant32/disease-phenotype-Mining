<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed based on the assumption that if two pH probes are placed equidistant from a distal acid source, and the probes measure different values, then one probe might miss acid if it were there alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed 24-hr intraesophageal pH monitoring in 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, simultaneously placing two pediatric pH probes (probes A and B) 5 cm proximal to the LES in such close proximity that one would expect only small differences in the acid exposure measured by the probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the amount of acid exposure measured by probes A and B differed greatly in some instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual probe performance does not alone account for these differences, since, when pH recordings were reviewed, one probe was as likely to miss acid exposure as the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These differences would result in a change in the clinical diagnosis in two of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variability in the number of episodes was great and occurred even when there was concordance in percent acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data raise questions about the absolute accuracy of the pH probe as the gold standard in the measurement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
