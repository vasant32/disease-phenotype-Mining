<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to show the early results of a combination of EAPC and antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were treated between August 1996 and December 1999 </plain></SENT>
