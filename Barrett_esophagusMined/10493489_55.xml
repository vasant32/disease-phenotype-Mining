<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The need for esophagectomy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, with no endoscopically visible lesion, and a biopsy showing high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has been questioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, endoscopic techniques to ablate the neoplastic mucosa have been encouraged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the extent of disease present in patients with clinically occult esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> to define the magnitude of therapy required to achieve cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (23 patients) or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (10 patients) and no endoscopically visible lesion underwent repeat endoscopy and systematic biopsy followed by esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surgical specimens were analyzed to determine the biopsy error rate in detecting occult <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, the depth of wall penetration and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> on conventional histology and immunohistochemistry staining was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings were compared with those in 12 patients (1 with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 11 with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) who had visible lesions on endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The biopsy error rate for detecting occult <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 25 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and no visible lesion, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was limited to the mucosa in 22 (88%) and to the submucosa in 3 (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After en bloc esophagectomy, one patient without a visible lesion had a single node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> on conventional histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No additional node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were identified on immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate after esophagectomy was 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with endoscopically visible lesions were significantly more likely to have invasion beyond the mucosa (9/12 vs. 3/25, p = 0.01) and involvement of lymph nodes (5/9 vs. 1/10, p = 0.057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopy with systematic biopsy cannot reliably exclude the presence of occult <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The lack of an endoscopically visible lesion does not preclude <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> invasion beyond the muscularis mucosae, cautioning against the use of mucosal ablative procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The rarity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> in these patients encourages a more limited resection with greater emphasis on improved alimentary function (esophageal stripping with vagal nerve preservation) to provide a quality of life compatible with the excellent 5-year survival rate of 90% </plain></SENT>
