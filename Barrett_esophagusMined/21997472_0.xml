<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the oesophageal function in patients with different types of oesophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and in cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on the basis of the Montreal definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 270 consecutive patients [M/F 151/119, mean age 54.2 years (19-84)] with endoscopic and histological evidence of oesophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> were prospectively studied: patients with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM, n = 109) and patients without SIM (n = 161) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with SIM were subdivided into a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-positive (n = 34) and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-negative (n = 75) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent reflux symptom analysis, oesophageal manometry, and simultaneous 24-hour pH and biliary reflux monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with SIM were significantly older and had a significantly higher body mass index than patients without SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant male predominance was observed in patients with SIM and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptom spectrum and the prevalence of erosive oesophageal lesions were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with SIM had longer metaplastic segments, which was further increased in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-positive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During oesophageal manometry, pH and biliary reflux monitoring, patients with SIM had more severe alterations than patients without SIM, and these were further increased in patients with SIM and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SIM had more severe oesophageal function abnormalities than those with other types of oesophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (e.g. gastric) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The oesophageal function was further impaired if <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was present in the metaplastic mucosa </plain></SENT>
