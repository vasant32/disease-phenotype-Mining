<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between reflux induced bile insult and MnSOD expression, as well as to examine therapies to preserve MnSOD expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we sought to examine the relationship between MnSOD protein expression and MnSOD enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MnSOD protein expression was determined by Western blot assay and enzymatic activity was determined by SOD assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The enzymatic activity of the Het-1A and Bar-T cells were compared both before and after treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MnSOD expression in Het-1A cells was decreased after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cells that received MnTBAP or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> oil pretreatment showed increased MnSOD expression compared with control untreated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Bar-T cells showed an increase in MnSOD expression after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cells that were pretreated with MnTBAP displayed a larger increase in MnSOD expression compared with the cells that were not pretreated prior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MnSOD activity was significantly different between the untreated cell lines (P = 0.01) and after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, Bar-T cells had significantly less MnSOD activity than Het-1A cells after each of the pretreatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated preservation of MnSOD expression in Het-1A cells that were pretreated with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> including MnTBAP, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> oil, and certain berry extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we demonstrated that Bar-T cells have significantly less MnSOD activity than Het-1A cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These finding have important implications for future studies regarding chemoprevention and the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
