<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extending investigation of LOH to large-scale clinical and public health science studies has proven difficult because of the small size and cellular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, in addition to the challenges associated with increasing throughput </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our approach to LOH analysis was developed using clinical biopsy samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and uses flow cytometric cell sorting to increase sample purity, whole genome amplification to increase sample amount, and automated fluorescent genotyping to increase sample throughput </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This approach allows LOH assessment at 20 loci in DNA extracted from 1000 flow-purified cells while maintaining accurate and reproducible allele ratios compared with the standard method of using genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method of analysis should allow accurate, reproducible determination of allele ratios in a variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant conditions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
