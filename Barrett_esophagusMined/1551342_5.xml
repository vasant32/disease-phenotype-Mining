<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method employs use of nonenzymatic disaggregation techniques and use of a specialized growth medium, M-19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Successful growth can be achieved in 60-70% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of four cultures are presented including <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>, Alcian blue, and cytokeratin staining properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural studies showed the presence of distended rough endoplasmic reticulum, abundant Golgi apparatus, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> granules, and cell-cell junctional complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colony formation in anchorage-independent growth in soft agar was not observed in any culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cultured cells were not capable of indefinite growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, they do not behave as fully transformed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Availability of this culture system should be of use to the study of the biology of this metaplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
