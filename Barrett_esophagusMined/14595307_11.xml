<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e>, such as high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, in patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the efficacy of autofluorescence endoscopy for detection of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 34 patients (28 men, 6 women; age range 40-77 years) with histopathologically proven short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autofluorescence endoscopy was performed by using monochromatized blue light (425-455 nm) filtered from a conventional <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> light source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 136 and 109 biopsy specimens were taken from Barrett's mucosa under control, respectively, white light endoscopy and autofluorescence endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found in 9 (8.3%) autofluorescence-guided biopsy specimens, which was significantly greater than the number of white light endoscopy-guided biopsy specimens with this finding (one positive biopsy specimen, 0.7% of total biopsy specimens obtained) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autofluorescence endoscopy detected high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 7 patients, 6 more than were identified with white light endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the one patient with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detected by white light endoscopy-guided biopsy specimens, autofluorescence-guided biopsy specimens revealed only low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Autofluorescence endoscopy in patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> increases the detection rate of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
