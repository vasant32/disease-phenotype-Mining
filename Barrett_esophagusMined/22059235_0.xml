<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study examined the interaction between natural history, current practice patterns in diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e>, and associated health resource utilization and costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cost analysis of a prospective population-based cohort of 1100 patients with a primary diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> was performed using chart review from the Australian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Study Clinical Follow-Up Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis enabled estimation of healthcare resources and associated costs in 2009 euros by stage of disease and treatment pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most patients (88·5 per cent) presented with stage II, III or IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>; 61·1 per cent (672 of 1100) were treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall mean costs were €37,195 (median €29,114) for patients undergoing surgery and €17,281 (median €13,066) for those treated without surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery contributed 66·4 per cent of the total costs (mean €24,697 per patient) in the surgical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the non-surgical group, use of chemotherapy was more prevalent (81·9 per cent of patients) and contributed 61·1 per cent of the total costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other important cost determinants were gastro-oesophageal junction <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, treatment location and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean costs of those monitored for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (7·3 per cent of patients) were lower, although about one-third still presented with advanced-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall costs for managing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> were high and dominated by surgery costs in patients treated surgically and by chemotherapy costs in patients treated without surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy, treatment location and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> subtype were also important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Monitoring for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and earlier-stage detection were associated with lower management costs, but the potential net benefit from surveillance strategies needs further investigation </plain></SENT>
