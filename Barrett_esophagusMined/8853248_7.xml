<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Acid suppression therapy and surgical antireflux procedures have not consistently led to regression of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that laser photocoagulation in combination with powerful acid suppression might destroy the metaplastic columnar epithelium and allow the area to be replaced by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with endoscopic and histologically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were recruited into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients were randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg daily and four patients received the same medical therapy plus repeated laser photocoagulation administered at 4-6 weekly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopies were performed on entry and at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of Barrett's epithelium was assessed and mapped on to a grid system and histological changes were assessed in blinded manner by a single histopathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One new quadrant of Barrett's segment was irradiated per treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Laser therapy was well tolerated and no complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 6 months, the extent of Barrett's epithelium was unchanged in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no appearance of squamous islands either endoscopically or microscopically in areas treated with laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nd-YAG laser is ineffective in ablating Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
