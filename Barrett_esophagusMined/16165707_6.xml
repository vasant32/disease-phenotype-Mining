<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of BO and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) in a population-based series of patients referred for first-time gastroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent endoscopy for the first time at endoscopy units exclusively serving defined catchment areas were invited to take part in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were taken immediately below the GOJ and from the distal oesophagus, and clinical data were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 769 patients (mean age 53 years, 43% M) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall IM prevalence was 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BO was noted in 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the prevalence of IM increased by 8% (95% CI 6-10%) per year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BO patients were predominately women (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Presence of cardia-type mucosa in the cardia increased with age from 25% among the youngest to 59% among the oldest patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic acinar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>) was found in 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While BO is not common among Swedish gastroscopy patients, IM and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi> are found in every 7th and 6th patient, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age-dependent increments in prevalence suggest that not only BO and IM, but also cardia-type mucosa are acquired and/or progressive lesions </plain></SENT>
