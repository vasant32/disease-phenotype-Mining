<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA replication errors and allelic losses of chromosomes 17p, 18q, and 5q were studied in 36 resected <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arising in the esophagus and esophagogastric junction, 56 Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, and 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with clinical and pathological characteristics, including patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Replication error positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was rare (5.4%) in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and was not found in Barrett mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an increase in the prevalence of chromosomal losses in the Barrett mucosa-columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence: 17p loss occurred in 14% of Barrett mucosae, 42% of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath>, 79% of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath>, and 75% of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, respectively; loss of 18q in 32%, 42%, 73%, and 69%; and loss of 5q in 10%, 21%, 27%, and 46% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical stage was a very strong prognostic factor for survival, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> with allelic loss of both 17p and 18q had worse survival than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with no or one allelic loss (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that accumulation of genetic alterations follows the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence in the esophagus and that losses of 18q and 17p occur earlier than 5q loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Allelic loss of both 17p and 18q in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> identifies patients with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
