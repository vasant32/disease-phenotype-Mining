<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine the efficacy and potential cost implications of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> (AA) chromoendoscopy in the assessment of Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our prospective database of patients referred between 2005 and 2010 with suspected early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-resolution Fujinon gastroscopes and EPX-4400 processor were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inspection of Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was carried out using white light followed by AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic areas were noted, and targeted biopsy was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was followed by quadrantic biopsies of the remaining Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cost of protocol-guided biopsies was compared with AA-guided biopsy protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two hundred sixty-three procedures on 197 patients were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was found during 143 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 96% of cases it was identified with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cost of histological evaluation by Cleveland protocol would be £139,416.30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cost by AA-targeted biopsy followed by random biopsies in one pot would be £25,032.50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For AA-targeted biopsies alone the cost would be £9,541.8 but results in a 4% miss rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AA localizes neoplastic lesions in the majority of patients and could potentially represent a significant cost saving in patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
