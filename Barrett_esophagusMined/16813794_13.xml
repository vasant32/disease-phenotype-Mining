<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In contrast to standard video endoscopy, magnifying endoscopy after local <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> application enables recognition of mucosal surface architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic yield of magnifying endoscopy with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>-targeted biopsies compared to random, 4-quadrant biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective randomized trial (ratio 1:1) with crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Two referral hospitals in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Thirty-one patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or visible columnar-lined lower esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to undergo either standard video endoscopy with 4-quadrant biopsies or magnifying endoscopy in conjunction with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were re-examined 14 days after the initial endoscopy with the corresponding procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome analysis (per protocol and per biopsy) was the histological proof of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome analysis was the correlation between the surface architecture and the presence of Barrett's epithelium and the needed number of biopsies to confirm Barrett's epithelium for the 2 different procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Magnifying endoscopy enabled the prediction of Barrett's epithelium with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 66%, respectively (accuracy 83.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">Acetic acid</z:chebi>-guided biopsies obtained a significantly higher percentage of tissues containing SCE (78%; 188/241) compared to random biopsies (57%; 159/280) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: No data on the diagnosis of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Magnifying endoscopy with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>-guided biopsies is superior to standard video endoscopy with random biopsies, and the number of biopsies needed to confirm Barrett's epithelium is half as much when compared to random biopsies </plain></SENT>
