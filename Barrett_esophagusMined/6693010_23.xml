<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical, endoscopic, histologic, manometric, and esophageal potential difference characteristics of 20 patients with columnar epithelia lining the lower esophagus (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopically, two distinct types were identified: a circumferential-type and an island-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with these types exhibited similarities in mean age, duration of symptoms, mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and frequency of gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only patients with the circumferential lesion, however, had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcers</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Manometric testing revealed a range of lower esophageal sphincter pressures from 3 to 33 mmHg and qualitative motor abnormalities (i.e., aperistalsis, repetitive waves, tertiary waves) in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the frequency of epithelial types was junctional greater than specialized columnar greater than atrophic fundic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More importantly, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was identified in 2 patients with the circumferential lesion and in 1 patient with the island lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Potential difference measurements demonstrated that a high potential difference (greater than -25 mV) was highly specific (92%), but only moderately sensitive (70%) for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we conclude (a) that there are at least two endoscopically distinct types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> involving the lower esophagus--a circumferential type and an island type, (b) that both types are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, with the island type being accompanied by less severe epithelial injury than the circumferential type, and (c) that the identification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the two types suggests that both are unstable lesions requiring continued surveillance with endoscopy and biopsy </plain></SENT>
