<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To obtain insight into the molecular processes underlying <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of the esophagus, we have used cDNA microarrays to compare the gene expression profiles of 128 tissue samples representing the major histological subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>)) as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), the precursor lesion to <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linear discriminant analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering show the separation of samples into 4 distinct groups consistent with their histological subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differentially expressed genes were identified between each of the tissue types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of gene ontologies and gene expression profiles identified gene profiles specific to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, as well as BE. "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Esophageal cancer</z:e> clusters," representing proliferation, immune response, and extracellular matrix genes were identified, as well as digestion, hydrolase, and transcription factor clusters specific to the columnar phenotype observed during BE and esophageal <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These clusters provide valuable insight into the molecular and functional differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium, BE, and the 2 histologically distinct forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our thorough, unbiased analysis provides a rich source of data for further studies into the molecular basis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of the esophagus, as well as identification of potential biomarkers for early detection of progression </plain></SENT>
