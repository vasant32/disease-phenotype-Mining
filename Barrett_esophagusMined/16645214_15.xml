<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 170 brushing specimens from 138 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> using fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes to 5p15, 5q21-22, centromere 7, 7p12, 8q24.12-13, centromere 9, 9p21, centromere 17, 17p13.1, 17q11.2-12, 20q13.2, and centromere Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operator curves were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of various four-probe combinations for detecting low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic biopsy results were used as the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Numerous four-probe combinations provided a similarly high sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, a set consisting of probes to 8q24, 9p21, 17q11.2, and 20q13.2 was found to have a sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 70% and 89% for low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 84% and 93% for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 94% and 93% for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This probe set was chosen for future prospective clinical evaluations based on its high sensitivity and specificity, its ability to distinguish <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and high-grade or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from lesser diagnostic categories, and the favorable signal quality for each of the probes </plain></SENT>
