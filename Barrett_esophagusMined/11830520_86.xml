<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, epithelial tissues undergo biochemical and structural changes that can manifest in tissue fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been several reports on different in vivo fluorescence characteristics between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and precancerous (dysplastic) tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it has been difficult to identify and quantify the origins of these changes, mainly because of distortions introduced in measured tissue fluorescence spectra by tissue scattering and absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such distortions can be removed by combining information in simultaneously measured fluorescence and reflectance spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we can recover the intrinsic (undistorted) tissue fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this report, we show that extraction of the intrinsic fluorescence allows us: (a) to determine the fluorescence spectra of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> and collagen in an in vivo environment, and (b) to use these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> and collagen spectra to describe, quantitatively, diagnostically significant biochemical changes between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and dysplastic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, by analyzing intrinsic fluorescence of human epithelial tissue as it becomes deoxygenated in vivo, we can resolve the fluorescence spectra of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> and collagen, two of the major tissue fluorophores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is important because fluorescence depends on the local environment of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23240">chromophore</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Then, we extract the intrinsic fluorescence spectra of sites from 35 patients with suspected cervical lesions and 7 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and describe them accurately as a linear combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> and collagen contributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both tissue cases, we find that low collagen and high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> fluorescence characterizes the high-grade dysplastic lesions when compared with nondysplastic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data present evidence for the presence of detectable levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> fluorescence in human epithelial tissues in an in vivo setting and demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> and collagen may be used as quantitative fluorescence biomarkers for in vivo detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the cervix and the esophagus </plain></SENT>
