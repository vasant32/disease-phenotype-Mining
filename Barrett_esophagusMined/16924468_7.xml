<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed recently that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) patients may be categorized into three distinct groups exhibiting non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), erosive reflux disease (ERD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurement of relative gene expression levels was undertaken to identify distinct molecular subclasses in different variants of gastroesophageal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The measurements were made with Affymetrix U133A 2.0 GeneChips and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolated from mucosal samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal epithelium from 24, 28, and 26 patients with NERD, ERD and BE, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical testing of microarray data showed that gene expression profiles are discriminative for BE and NERD, but not for combinations of BE and ERD or NERD and ERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, women developing NERD exhibited transcriptional patterns that differed from those of men with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In clustering analyses, we did not observe correlations between sex and assignment of gene expression profile of ERD patients to either the NERD or the BE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the biological significance of the identified genes remains uncertain, we hypothesize that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is a monophyletic disease that develops with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and represents two main molecular classes, which may result in different progressions to inflammatory process within esophageal epithelium modulated by sexual dimorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium samples from NERD and BE patients are molecularly homogeneous, esophageal mucosa from ERD patients is molecularly similar to either NERD or BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings may be useful for defining molecular markers which could predict potential progression to Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> among patients with reflux disease </plain></SENT>
