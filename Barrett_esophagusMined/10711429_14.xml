<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent radial endoscopic ultrasound scanning to measure esophageal wall thickness, followed by endoscopy with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> staining and biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean esophageal wall thickness for squamous mucosa (2.3 +/- 0.2 mm), nondysplastic Barrett's (2.6 +/- 0.2 mm), and Barrett's with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (2.9 +/- 0.3 mm) were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With staining, Barrett's mucosa stained blue more often than gastric epithelium (68% vs 15%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity for strong staining detecting Barrett's were 68% and 85%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Barrett's with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> stained blue less frequently (52%) than nondysplastic Barrett's (74%; P &lt; 0.05), but the positive predictive value for poor staining indicating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic ultrasound was not helpful in directing biopsies in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The utility of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> for detecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> needs further investigation </plain></SENT>
