<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) incidence in many developed countries has increased dramatically over four decades, while survival remains poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), who experience substantially elevated EA risk, are typically followed in surveillance involving periodic endoscopy with biopsies, although few progress to EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No medical, surgical or lifestyle interventions have been proven to safely lower EA risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We investigated whether smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or alcohol could predict progression to EA in a prospective cohort of 411 BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were collected during personal interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 39% had body mass index (BMI) over 30 and 64% had smoked cigarettes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Main analyses focused on those with at least 5 months of follow-up (33,635 person-months), in whom 45 developed EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk increased by 3% per year of age (trend p-value 0.02), with approximate doubling of risk among males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EA risk increased with smoking pack-years (trend p-value 0.04) and duration (p-value 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to never-smokers, the HR for those in the highest pack-year tertile was 2.29 (95%CI 1.04-5.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No association was found with alcohol or BMI, whereas a suggestion of increased risk was observed in those with higher waist-hip ratio, especially among males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA risk significantly increased with increasing age and cigarette exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, but not BMI, was associated with a modest increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Continued follow-up of this and other cohorts is needed to precisely define these relationships so as to inform risk stratification and preventive interventions </plain></SENT>
