<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The factors associated with frequent relapses are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied retrospectively a population of 58 patients with benign peptic strictures and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> treated by <z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>esophageal dilation</z:mp> and followed for 66.5 +/- 6.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data was collected for age, sex, heartburn, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, number of dilation treatments during the first year of follow-up, frequency and number of subsequent dilation treatments, type of dilator used, and history of other concurrent treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who lacked heartburn (P = 0.007) or who reported a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (P = 0.006) at the time of their initial presentation required more frequent dilations during the first year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean number of dilations in year 1 was 6.2 +/- 0.9 for patients lacking heartburn versus 3.2 +/- 0.5 for patients with heartburn (P = 0.004), and 9.0 +/- 1.8 for patients who reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> versus 4.1 +/- 0.5 (P = 0.006) for those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients requiring frequent treatment during their first year also required frequent subsequent dilations because of stricture recurrence (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not demonstrate any relationship between the other factors studied and treatment frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that patients who require frequent retreatment for recurrent peptic stricture are more likely to provide a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and less likely to complain of heartburn at initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pattern of frequent repeat dilation for recurrent peptic strictures is established during the first year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
