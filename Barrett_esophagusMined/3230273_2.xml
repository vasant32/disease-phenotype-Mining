<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We had used lectins, naturally occurring proteins used as molecular probes of carbohydrate structure, to identify a marker of premalignant epithelium in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a similar approach to study metaplastic and neoplastic epithelium in the upper gastrointestinal tract, with an emphasis on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The carbohydrate structures (i.e., the glycoconjugates) present faithfully reflected the morphological features, rather than the anatomical location, of each tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of note, only minor modifications in carbohydrate structure were seen in low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, whereas more distinct changes were seen in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This approach provides insight into the biochemistry and metabolism occurring with disordered maturation of the epithelial cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of this type of investigation is to develop sensitive markers of earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
