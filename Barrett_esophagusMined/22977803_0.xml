<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We proposed an integrated model of international conference based on the putative occurrence of Digestive Endoscopy Networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In International Digestive Endoscopy Network (IDEN) 2012, role of endoscopy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, endoscopy beyond submucosa, endoscopic treatment for stricture and leakage in upper GI, how to estimate the invasion depth of early GI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, colonoscopy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD), a look into the bowel beyond colon in IBD, management of complications in therapeutic colonoscopy, revival of endoscopic papllirary balloon dilation, evaluation and tissue acquisition for indeterminate biliopancreatic stricture, updates in the evaluation of pancreatic cystic lesions, issues for tailored endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), endoluminal stents, management of upper GI <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, endoscopic management of frustrating situations, small bowel exploration, colorectal ESD, valuable tips for frustrating situations in colonoscopy, choosing the right stents for endoscopic stenting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0597984" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">biliary strictures</z:e>, advanced techniques for pancreaticobiliary visualization, endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliopancreatic drainage, and how we can overcome the obstacles were deeply touched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hope that IDEN 2012, as the very prestigious endoscopy networks, served as an opportunity to gain some clues for further understanding of endoscopic technologies and to enhance up-and-coming knowledge and their clinical implications from selected 25 peer reviewed articles and 112 invited lectures </plain></SENT>
