<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within this field, ultramicroscopic study, enzyme assays and the techniques of flow cytometry are being used to better define this problem and to specify the point after which it is legitimate to abandon the medical treatment of reflux in favor of more aggressive methods, even surgical resection of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
