<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The contribution of gastric acid to the toxicity of alkaline duodenal refluxate on the esophageal mucosa is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared the effect of duodenal refluxate when acid was present, decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>), or absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomized 136 Sprague-Dawley rats into 4 groups: group 1 (n = 33) were controls; groupÂ 2 (n = 34) underwent esophagoduodenostomy promoting "combined reflux"; group 3 (n = 34) underwent esophagoduodenostomy and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment to decrease <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>; and group 4, the 'gastrectomy' group (n = 35) underwent esophagoduodenostomy and total gastrectomy to eliminate acid in the refluxate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Esophaguses were examined for inflammatory, Barrett's, and other histologic changes, and expression of proliferative markers Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reflux groups, the incidence of Barrett's mucosa was greater when acid was suppressed (group C, 62%; group D, 71%) than when not suppressed (group B, 27%; P = 0.004 and P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>Erosions</z:mpath> were more frequent in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> and gastrectomy groups than in the combined reflux group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> (wet weight) and ulceration was more frequent in the gastrectomy than in the combined reflux group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> inflammatory changes were infrequent in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> group (8%) compared with the combined reflux (94%) or gastrectomy (100%) groups, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> persisted in 100% of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EGFR levels were greater in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> compared with the combined reflux group (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ki-67, PCNA, and combined marker scores were greater in the gastrectomy compared with the combined reflux group (P = .006, P = .14, and P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gastric acid suppression in the presence of duodenal refluxate caused increased rates of inflammatory changes, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and molecular proliferative activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> suppressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory changes only, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory changes persisted </plain></SENT>
