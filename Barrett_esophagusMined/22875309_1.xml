<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) is a new technique allowing in vivo detection of neoplastic tissue using a standard endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Our aim was to compare the incident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection rate of biopsies obtained by high-definition white light endoscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE) or by pCLE in a cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) participating in a surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty of 100 patients underwent pCLE in addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four-quadrant biopsy specimens according to the Seattle biopsy protocol were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients to ensure standard-of-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was made by a blinded gastrointestinal pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incident high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) were diagnosed in 3/100 and in 16/100 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE group, areas suspicious for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were not observed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was diagnosed in 5/50 (10%) patients (one with HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the pCLE group, areas suspicious for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were observed by pCLE in 21/50 (42%) patients; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was confirmed in 14 cases (28%) (two with HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection rate was significantly higher in the pCLE group than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE group (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of pCLE for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were 100, 83, 67, and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> can be more frequently detected by pCLE than by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-WLE in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The higher <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection rate provided by pCLE could improve the efficacy of BE surveillance programs </plain></SENT>
