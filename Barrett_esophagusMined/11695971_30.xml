<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Five hundred two consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> documented by 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring and with complete demographic, endoscopic, and physiological evaluation, divided in groups according to the presence and extent of BE (328 patients without BE and 174 with BE [67 short-segment BE and 107 long-segment BE]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical, endoscopic, and physiological data, studied by multivariate analysis, to identify the independent predictors of the presence and extent of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven factors were identified as predictors of BE </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three factors were identified as predictors of long-segment BE (baseline short-segment BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> larger than 4 cm (OR, 17.8; 95% CI, 4.1-76.6), a defective lower esophageal sphincter (OR, 16.9; 95% CI, 1.6-181.4), and an abnormal longest reflux episode (OR, 8.1; 95% CI, 2.8-24.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, specific factors are associated with the presence and extent of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Elimination of reflux with an antireflux operation in patients with 1 or more of these factors may prevent the future development of BE </plain></SENT>
