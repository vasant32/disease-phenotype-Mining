<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the association between visceral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the risk of BE is entirely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 163 patients with non-alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (NAFLD) who underwent both endoscopy and abdominal CT at an interval of less than a year at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BE was endoscopically diagnosed based on the Prague C &amp; M Criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surface areas of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were calculated from CT images at the level of the umbilicus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlations between the BMI, VAT, and SAT and the risk of BE were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-nine of the 163 study participants (42.3%) were diagnosed to have endoscopic BE, which was classified as short-segment BE (SSBE) in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the age or gender distribution between the groups with and without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to the results of the univariate analysis, VAT was significantly associated with the risk of BE; the BMI tended to be higher in the group with BE than in the group without BE, but this relation did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VAT was independently associated with the risk of BE even after adjustment for the BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In Japanese patients with NAFLD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> tended to be associated with the risk of BE, and this risk appeared to be mediated for the most part by abdominal visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
