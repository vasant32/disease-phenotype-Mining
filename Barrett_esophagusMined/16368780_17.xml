<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is frequently involved in gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> although its contribution to oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC) and its precursor Barrett's oesophageal epithelium (BE) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of TGF-beta signalling components was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blot, and immunohistochemistry in oesophageal endoscopic biopsies and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic alterations in SMAD4 were characterised by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, methylation specific PCR, and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional integrity of TGF-beta signalling was assessed by characterisation of p21 and proliferation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Smad4 negative BIC-1 cells were transiently transfected with smad4 and TGF-beta responsiveness evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: smad4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was progressively reduced in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A quarter of AC samples displayed an abnormal Smad4 protein isoform, with no corresponding changes in gene sequence or organisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Methylation of smad4 has not been described previously but we found promoter methylation in 70% of primary AC samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 6/8 oesophageal cell lines, chromosomal rearrangements affected the smad4 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lack of smad4 expression in BIC-1 cells occurred secondary to loss of one copy and extensive deletion of the second allele's promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta dependent induction of p21 and downregulation of minichromosome maintenance protein 2 was lost in &gt;80% of BE and AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta failed to inhibit proliferation in 5/8 oesophageal cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In BIC-1, the antiproliferative response was restored following transient transfection of smad4 cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In BE <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, downregulation of Smad4 occurs due to several different mechanisms, including methylation, deletion, and protein modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Frequent alterations in TGF-beta signalling lead to a functionally significant impairment of TGF-beta mediated growth suppression </plain></SENT>
