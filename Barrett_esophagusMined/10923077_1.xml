<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pancreatic acinar tissue (PAT) at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) has been reported in 3% of adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and in 24% of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of this ectopic tissue is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both an acquired metaplastic process in the setting of BE and a congenital abnormality have been suggested in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the origin of PAT at the GEJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed material obtained from the GEJ in 69 children and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each specimen was evaluated by 3 levels stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin for the presence of PAT, BE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Selected cases were also examined with immunohistochemical stains for lipase, trypsin, and amylase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 16% of the study population, PAT was present at the GEJ and was not associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> did not vary significantly between patients with and without PAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that PAT at the GEJ develops independently of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and is, therefore, likely to be congenital </plain></SENT>
