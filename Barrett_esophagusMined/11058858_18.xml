<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that anatomic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the cardia induces a lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction that may be corrected by narrowing the gastroesophageal junction (i.e., calibration of the cardia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured the perimeter of the cardia during surgery in control subjects and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then tested our hypothesis in a mechanical model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The model was based on a pig gastroesophageal specimen with perpendicularly placed elastic bands around the cardia simulating the action of the "sling" and "clasp" fibers. "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>Dilatation</z:mpath>" of the cardia was induced by displacing the sling band laterally and decreasing its tension. "Calibration" of the cardia was performed by reapproximation of the sling band toward the esophagus but maintaining the same tension as the dilated model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the "basal," "dilated," and "calibrated" states, the perimeter of the cardia was noted and rapid mechanized pullback manometry with a water-perfused catheter was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The opening pressure was determined, and three-dimensional sphincter pressure images were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average cardia perimeter was 6.3 cm in control subjects, 8.9 cm in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients, and 13.8 cm in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The arrangement of the bands in the experimental model generated a manometric high-pressure zone similar to that in the human lower esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>Dilatation</z:mpath> of the cardia resulted in a decrease in the resting pressure, length, and vector volume of the high -pressure zone, and reduced the opening pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Calibration restored the resting and opening pressure, and normalized the three-dimensional pressure image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, the cardia is dilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our model supports the hypothesis that lower esophageal sphincter function is compromised by anatomic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the cardia and can be restored by approximation of the "sling" fibers toward the lesser curvature "clasp" fibers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This provides evidence for a correlation between gastroesophageal sphincter dysfunction in reflux disease and its correction by antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
