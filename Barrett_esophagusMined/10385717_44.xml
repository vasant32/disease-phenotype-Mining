<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate pathologic interpretation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> by general pathologists in community practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five histologic slides representing different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> were submitted for review by 20 randomly selected general pathologists in community practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were three cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (one with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, one with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and one with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) and two cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> (one fundic-type and one cardia-type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was identified as such by 30% of pathologists and was called invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> by 20%, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by 30%, and moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by the remaining 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was identified as such by 35% of pathologists and was called high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by 20%, moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by 20%, and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specialized columnar epithelium with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was identified as such by 35%, called low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by 35%, moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by 15%, indeterminate for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by 10%, and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> by 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>Gastric metaplasia</z:mp> without specialized columnar epithelium was identified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 38% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:Pathologic interpretation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> by community pathologists may be subject to marked interobserver variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The term <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is often used to describe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> without goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because this finding is not clearly associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, these data support recent suggestions that the term <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> be abandoned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interpretations of both high-grade and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> should be considered for review by experts in esophageal pathology </plain></SENT>
