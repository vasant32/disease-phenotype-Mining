<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histology of the mucosa from the area adjacent to the biopsy sites was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Esophageal biopsies were obtained from three different sites in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gastric biopsies were obtained from the antrum, fundus, and the area just distal to the lower border of the lower esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The columnar mucosa lining the esophagus was of three distinct types, namely, fundic, transitional (cardiac), or specialized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of these epithelia nor the squamous epithelium showed any detectable gastrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, antral mucosa had very high gastrin content; smaller amounts of gastrin were detected in duodenal epithelium, whereas fundic mucosa sometimes contained small amounts of gastrin </plain></SENT>
