<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is based on finding of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of at least 3 cm of the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of less than 3 cm of the distal esophagus is controversial, regarding implications with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and Helicobacter pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the distal esophagus in patients with short segments of esophageal columnar-appearing mucosa (less than 3 cm), diagnosed endoscopically, in two groups of patients, with and without symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 97 patients were examined, with endoscopic finding of esophageal columnar-appearing mucosa less than 3 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the total, 52 patients had symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and 45 patients were without these symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients were subjected to distal esophageal biopsies obtained immediately below the epithelial transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The biopsies were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin and alcian blue at pH 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urease test for H. pylori detection in two fragments of gastric antrum was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the distal esophagus was diagnosed in 16 (30.8%) patients in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> group and 12 (26.7%) patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study diagnosed high prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the distal esophagus with columnar-appearing mucosa, less than 3 cm, with no statistical differences in the two groups studied with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
