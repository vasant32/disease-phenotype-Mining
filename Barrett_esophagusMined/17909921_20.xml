<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The increasing adoption of endoscopic therapies and expectant surveillance for patients with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has created considerable controversy regarding the ideal treatment choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>Confusion</z:hpo> may be due, in part, to a limited understanding of the outcomes associated with surgical resection for HGD and extrapolation of data derived from patients undergoing an esophagectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to document the perioperative and symptomatic outcomes and long-term survival after esophagectomy for HGD of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 38 patients who underwent esophagectomy for biopsy-proven HGD between 10/1999 and 6/2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients were excluded from analysis due to obvious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> on upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated regarding ten different foregut symptoms and administered a ten-question appraisal of eating and bowel habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included postoperative morbidity and mortality, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> in the esophagectomy specimens, symptomatic and functional alimentary results, patient satisfaction, and long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 32 months (range, 7-83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-day postoperative and in-hospital mortality was zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 37% (13/35), and median length of stay was 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Occult <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was found in 29% (10/35) of surgical specimens (intramucosal in four; submucosal in five; and intramuscular in one with a single positive lymph node.) Patients consumed a median of three meals per day, most (76%, 26/34) had no dietary restrictions, and two-thirds (23/34) considered their eating pattern to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or only mildly impacted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Meal size, however, was reported to be smaller in the majority (79%, 27/34) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median body mass index (BMI) decreased slightly after surgery (28.6 vs 26.6, p&gt;0.05), but no patient's BMI went below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The number of bowel movements/day was unchanged or less in a majority (82%) of patients after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 34 (44%) patients reported loose bowel movements, which occurred less often than once per week in 10 of the 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One patient had symptoms of dumping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Mean symptom severity scores improved for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptoms except <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003298'>choking</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed foregut symptoms that occurred daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Most patients (82%) required at least one postoperative dilation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (97%) patients were satisfied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival was 100%, and overall survival was 97% (34/35) at a median of 32 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Esophagectomy is an effective and curative treatment for HGD and can be performed with no mortality, acceptable morbidity, and good alimentary outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These data provide a gold standard for comparison to alternative therapies </plain></SENT>
