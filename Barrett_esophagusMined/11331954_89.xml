<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Criteria for morphologic evaluation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the presumed precursor lesion, have been established, although there are surprisingly few data in the literature correlating biopsy diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We collected follow-up information on 138 patients with BE whose initial endoscopic biopsy specimens had been selected for submission in an interobserver variability study performed by 12 pathologists with special interest in gastrointestinal pathology and reviewed blindly twice each by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were scored as BE with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, atypia indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (IND), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and frankly invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, thus generating 24 scores on each biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was obtained and correlated with both the submitting diagnoses and majority diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to compare both the submitting and majority diagnoses with outcome using detection or documentation of invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> as the endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the submitting diagnoses, no invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were detected in 44 cases diagnosed as BE (median follow-up, 38.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinomas</z:mp> were detected in 4 of 22 (18%) cases submitted as IND (median progression-free survival of 62 months), in 4 of 25 (15%) cases of LGD (median progression-free survival of 60 months), in 20 of 33 cases of HGD (median progression-free survival, 8 months), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 (100%) cases submitted as <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade on initial biopsy correlated significantly with progression to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (log-rank P =.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Majority diagnosis was achieved in 99 of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using the majority diagnoses, no invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were found in 50 cases of BE (median follow-up, 48 months), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were detected in 1 of 7 (14%) IND cases (80% progression-free survival at 2 months), 3 of 15 (20%) LGD (median progression-free survival, 60 months), 9 of 15 (60%) HGD (median progression-free survival, 7 months), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 (100%) <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Initial grading again correlated significantly with progression to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (log-rank P =.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, there were 39 cases without a majority diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among these, no <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> developed in 8 cases with an average score between BE and IND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinomas</z:mp> were detected in 9 of 21 (43%) cases with an average score between IND and LGD, and 7 of 10 (70%) cases with an average score between LGD and HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in 8 of 39 cases (20%) of the "no-majority" group and in 13 of 99 (13%) of the majority cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These data support combining the IND and LGD categories for surveillance purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Cases without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> may be followed up conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The data obtained from submitted diagnoses as opposed to those from blind review suggest that knowledge of the clinical findings <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The data also support the assertion that HGD is strongly associated with invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Rebiopsy of ulcerated areas should be considered because they may harbor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
