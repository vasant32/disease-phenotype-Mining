<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients between 18 months and 25 yr of age with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> who underwent an upper endoscopy with biopsies during 1996-2000 at Texas Children's Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A manual review of the endoscopy and histopathology reports was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We excluded patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo>, congenital esophageal anomalies, or those with incomplete endoscopic description of the esophagus or absent histopathological reports on esophageal biopsies if BE was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the demographic, endoscopic, and histopathological findings and determined the prevalence of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (defined by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>) and BE in children without neurological or congenital esophageal anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 402 neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children without congenital esophageal anomalies who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 208 (51.7%) patients were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 9.7 yr (range 1.5-25 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ethnic distribution was as follows: 64.7% white, 7.7% black, 11.7% Hispanic, and 15.9% other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was reported in 139 patients (34.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in the demographic characteristics of patients with and without erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At endoscopy, BE was suspected in 11 patients (2.7%) because of the presence of pink colored mucosa at the lower end of the tubular esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination of two to four targeted biopsies taken from these areas revealed fundic gastric glands with no evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in any of these 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Manifestations of severe disease such as erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were present in more than one-third of patients in a large cohort of neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> who underwent endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to examine the future subsequent clinical course of these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, BE was absent making it likely that the duration of reflux is a major risk factor for BE </plain></SENT>
