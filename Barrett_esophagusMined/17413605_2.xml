<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients who have undergone esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction often have complaints of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A subset of these patients will develop columnar epithelium in the remnant esophagus, which can be of the gastric or intestinal type (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GOALS: To determine whether gastric-type mucosa (GM) in the esophagus is a precursor stage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY: The medical records of 613 patients having undergone esophagectomy were reviewed for the endoscopic presence of segments with columnar mucosa in the remnant esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of them, 45 patients underwent endoscopic follow-up at least 6 months after resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of IM in the remnant esophagus was determined histologically in archival biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intestinal characteristics were identified by immunohistochemistry for CDX2, MUC2, and cytokeratins 7 and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CDX2 transcription was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 18 of 45 patients (40%) GM was identified, and 7 of these patients also had foci of IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CDX2 and MUC2 expression was observed in IM, and in 2 patients, CDX2 expression was also observed in gastric-type glands at a distance from intestinal glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CDX2 transcription was identified in 2 patients without IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of patients after esophageal resection, expression of CDX2 and MUC2 in the remnant esophagus was only detectable in IM, but CDX2 was also observed in 4 cases with only GM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This could indicate that induction of formation of GM and IM may share a common pathway, eventually leading to the development of specialized intestinal epithelium </plain></SENT>
