<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic screening of the at-risk population with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) for the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has been suggested as a method to reduce mortality from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are only limited data regarding the use, effectiveness, and temporal trends of this strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients aged 68 years and older with a new diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus from 1994 to 2002 were identified from a linked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> registry health claims database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using claims from 1991 to 2002, the use of endoscopy as well as a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> during the time interval from 3 years through 6 months prior to diagnosis were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of these measures with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (in situ, local) and long-term survival was determined, as well as changes over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 2,754 patients, including 30.8% at early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previous endoscopy had been performed in 11.5% of patients, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnoses were recorded in 22.4 and 8.1% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosis was strongly associated with both early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (odds ratio 3.68, confidence interval (CI) 1.30-10.40) and survival (hazard ratio 0.45, CI 0.25-0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> diagnosis was associated only with early stage, and endoscopy was associated only with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no association of year of diagnosis with stage or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although only a minority of at-risk patients were identified, the findings are consistent with the beneficial effects of recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite the development of practice guidelines, we were unable to demonstrate any temporal increases in diagnostic frequency or endoscopic utilization, which highlights the challenges that clinicians face </plain></SENT>
