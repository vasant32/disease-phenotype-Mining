<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is not visible during routine endoscopy, random biopsies in the four quadrants every 1-2 cm are recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic fluorescence detection (EFD) after sensitisation with 5-aminolaevulinic acid (5-ALA) with different modes and concentrations was assessed to optimise the technique for detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>5-ALA is converted intracellularly to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX which accumulates in malignant tissue and can be detected by typical red fluorescence after illumination with blue light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 47 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, 10 with known <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 58 fluorescence endoscopies were performed after sensitisation with different concentrations of 5-ALA given orally (5, 10, 20, 30 mg/kg) or locally (500-1000 mg) by spraying the mucosa via a catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EFD was performed 4-6 hours after systemic and 1-2 hours after local sensitisation using a special light source delivering white or blue light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 243 biopsies of red fluorescent (n=113) and non-fluorescent areas (n=130) were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In three patients, two early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, not visible during routine endoscopy, were detected by EFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty three biopsies revealed either low or high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity for detection of dysplastic lesions ranged from 60% after local sensitisation with 500 mg to 80%, 100%, and 100% after systemic application of 5-ALA 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, specificity was best for local sensitisation (70%) while systemic administration revealed values between 27% and 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using 5 mg/kg, no red fluorescence in dysplastic lesions was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No severe side effects were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EFD is a promising tool to detect non-visible dysplastic lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> using 5-ALA sensitisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A randomised controlled study is now indicated to compare the efficacy of EFD with the standard technique of four quadrant random biopsies </plain></SENT>
