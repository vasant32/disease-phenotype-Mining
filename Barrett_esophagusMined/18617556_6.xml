<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that, in esophageal squamous epithelial cells, there are differences among individuals in the signal transduction pathways activated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> that might underlie the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore that hypothesis, we immortalized nonneoplastic, esophageal squamous cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) with (NES-B3T) and without (NES-G2T) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and used those cells to study acid effects on MAPK proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During endoscopy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, we took biopsy specimens from the distal squamous esophagus to study MAPK proteins before and after esophageal perfusion with 0.1 N HCl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used immunoblotting and Western blotting to study MEK1/2 phosphorylation at two activating sites (serines 217/221), MEK1 phosphorylation at an inhibitory site (threonine 286), and MEK1/2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After acid exposure, both cell lines exhibited increased MEK1/2 phosphorylation at the activating sites; the NES-B3T cells had higher levels of MEK1 phosphorylation at the inhibitory site, however, and only the NES-G2T cells showed an acid-induced increase in MEK1/2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in the squamous epithelium of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, acid perfusion increased MEK1/2 phosphorylation at the activating sites in both patient groups; the Barrett's patients had higher levels of MEK1 phosphorylation at the inhibitory site, however, and only the patients without Barrett's demonstrated an acid-induced increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In esophageal squamous cell lines and biopsies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, we have found differences in MAPK pathways activated by acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We speculate that these differences might underlie the development of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
