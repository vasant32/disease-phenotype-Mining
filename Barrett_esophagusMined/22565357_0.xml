<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of upper gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities in healthy asymptomatic volunteers using unsedated transnasal esophagogastroduodenoscopy (T-EGD) with an ultrathin endoscope as an additional screening tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study from one academic medical center with extensive experience in T-EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive 150 subjects volunteering for research studies were initially screened by using a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) questionnaire, interviewing, and examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these, they were stratified as healthy asymptomatic volunteers or with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unsedated T-EGD was then performed by a faculty member who was blinded to the results of the initial assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On initial assessment using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> questionnaire, medical interviewing, and physical examination, of the total 150 consecutive research volunteers, 83 (average age 33 ± 16 years; 46 females, 37 males) subjects were healthy asymptomatic volunteers and 67 (average age 36 ± 15 years; 35 females, 32 males) had symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On T-EGD, GI pathology was found in 15 of 83 (18%) healthy asymptomatic volunteers as compared to 24 of 67 (36%) stratified as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The esophageal abnormalities found in healthy asymptomatic volunteers were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (13.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (2.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> (2.4%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (2.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A small but significant number of asymptomatic subjects have abnormal upper GI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, transnasal unsedated endoscopy can be considered as a screening tool to stratify subjects as healthy, especially when considering them for research studies </plain></SENT>
