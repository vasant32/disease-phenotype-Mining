<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of prostate-specific membrane antigen in nonneoplastic neovasculature has not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied nonneoplastic reparative and regenerative human tissues, as well as preneoplastic tissue, to determine the presence of prostate-specific membrane antigen-expressing neovasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from <z:hpo ids='HP_0010562'>keloids</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> from heart valves and pleura, proliferative and secretory endometrium, and Barrett's mucosa with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were stained for the expression of prostate-specific membrane antigen (3E6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vessels of proliferative, mid-secretory, and late secretory endometrium were consistently strongly positive for prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ten cases of each type (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vessels associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> from pleural peels and heart valves were positive in 10 of 12 cases (83%) and 7 of 10 cases (70%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010562'>Keloids</z:hpo> had prostate-specific membrane antigen-expressing endothelial cells in 6 of 15 cases (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prostate-specific membrane antigen was not expressed by vessels associated with Barrett's mucosa with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (12 foci), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (24 foci), or no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (18 foci) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A variety of nonneoplastic neovasculature expresses prostate-specific membrane antigen, including vessels in proliferative endometrium, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath>, and some scars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first study showing that prostate-specific membrane antigen is expressed in neovasculature from physiologic regenerative and reparative conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> hydrolase activity of prostate-specific membrane antigen may facilitate vasculogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> by increasing local availability of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings will enhance our overall understanding of blood vessel development and will enable us to better understand the effects of anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen therapies, which are already being explored in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
