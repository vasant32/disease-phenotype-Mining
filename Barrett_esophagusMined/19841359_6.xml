<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few publications refer to the results of surgery 5 years after the fact among patients with short-segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the late results of 3 surgical procedures in patients with short-segment BE by subjective and objective measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized study starting on March 1, 1987, and ending on December 31, 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A prospective, descriptive study of a group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 125 patients with short-segment BE underwent 3 operations in different periods: duodenal switch plus highly selective vagotomy and antireflux technique in 31 patients, vagotomy plus partial gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y loop with antireflux surgery in 58 patients, and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Late subjective and objective outcomes of the 3 different surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No operative mortality and only 2 postoperative complications (1.6%) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> to cardiac or oxyntocardiac mucosa occurred in 60.8% to 65.4% of the patients, at a mean time of 39 to 56 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visick grading showed Visick grade I or II in 86.3% to 100.0% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No progression to low- or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication seems to be the surgical option for patients with short-segment BE because it is less invasive, has fewer side effects, and produces good results in the long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
