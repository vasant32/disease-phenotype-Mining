<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The chemopreventive effects of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> have been extensively examined, but its role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development or as a chemotherapeutic agent has only recently been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1, SBP1, hSP56) has been shown to bind <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> covalently and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> deficiency has been associated with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC), we examined its role in EAC development and its potential effect on chemosensitivity in the presence of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: SELENBP1 expression level and copy number variation were determined by oligonucleotide microarrays, real-time reverse transcription-PCR, tissue microarrays, immunoblotting, and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">Bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing and sequence analysis of reverse transcription-PCR-amplified products explored epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulation of SELENBP1 expression, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>WST-1 cell proliferation assays, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry were done to evaluate the biological significance of SELENBP1 overexpression in <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>-supplemented EAC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SELENBP1 expression decreased significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both epigenetic and posttranscriptional mechanisms seemed to modulate SELENBP1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stable overexpression of SELENBP1 in methylseleninic acid-supplemented Flo-1 cells resulted in enhanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, increased cellular senescence, and enhanced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although inorganic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="48843">sodium selenite</z:chebi> similarly enhanced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> cytotoxicity, these two forms of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> elicited different cellular responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SELENBP1 expression may be an important predictor of response to chemoprevention or chemosensitization with certain forms of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> in esophageal tissues </plain></SENT>
