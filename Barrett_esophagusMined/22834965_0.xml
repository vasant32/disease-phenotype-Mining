<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The high concentration of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) around the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) might play an important role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), a precursor of Barrett's adenocarcimona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although previous studies revealed that the expression of caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2), an important marker of BE, might be induced through Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), the roles of NO in this signal transduction remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: First, we investigated the expressions of EGFR, CDX2 and nitrotyrosine by immunohistochemical study for BE and squamous epithelium of human specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, we studied the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> stimulator, SIN-1, or NO donor, NOC7, on the expression of phosphorylated EGFR and CDX2 in KYSE30, an EGFR-rich human esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> cell-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific inhibitors for EGFR, AG1478 and small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> for EGFR (EGFR-siRNA) were employed to elucidate the role of EGFR in the induction of CDX2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The immunohistochemical study revealed that the expressions of EGFR, CDX2 and nitrotyrosine in BE were stronger than those in squamous epithelium with positive correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, SIN-1 or NOC7 induced EGFR phosphorylation and CDX2 expression in dose- and time-dependent manners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both EGFR phosphorylation and CDX2 induction were significantly diminished by AG 1478 and EGFR-siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We revealed for the first time that extrinsic NO might directly induce CDX2 expression through EGFR phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggested that NO had an important role in the development of BE from squamous epithelium around GEJ </plain></SENT>
