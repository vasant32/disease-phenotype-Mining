<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> can be divided into three categories: nonerosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (NERD), erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (ERD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A shift among these categories rarely occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to elucidate potential patient-associated risk factors associated with ERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 6,215 patients with troublesome heartburn were recruited to a large, prospective, multicenter open cohort study comprising an initial treatment phase and a 5-yr follow-up phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each center planned to recruit an equal number of patients with NERD and ERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent an interview based on standardized questionnaires, a physical examination, and endoscopy with biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Risk factor analysis was performed on 5,289 patients (NERD: n = 2,834; ERD: n = 2,455), which was the intent-to-treat population excluding patients with suspected/proven complicated reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stepwise regression analysis identified the following independent predictors of ERD: male gender, overweight, regular use of alcohol, a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> &gt;1 yr, and smoker or ex-smoker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A higher level of education and a positive Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) status were associated with a lower risk of ERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Some patient-associated factors increase the risk of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> as opposed to nonerosive reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no single factor or combination of factors is capable of predicting mucosal damage with clinically sufficient certainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, endoscopy is still required in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients if valid information on the state of the esophageal mucosa is needed </plain></SENT>
