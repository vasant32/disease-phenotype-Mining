<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OAC) has a poor prognosis, and chemoprevention is an attractive option to reduce the burden of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">Hydroxyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-CoA reductase inhibitors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>) have been shown to exert potentially useful anticancer effects against OAC cell lines, but there are only limited clinical data examining the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on the incidence of OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use and the incidence of OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have carried out a case-control study comparing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use between patients with an incident diagnosis of OAC and controls with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases were compared with 170 age-matched and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors and drug exposure were established using standardized interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to compare <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> exposure and correct for confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Regular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use was associated with a significantly lower incidence of OAC [uncorrected odds ratio (OR) 0.45, 95% confidence intervals 0.24-0.84)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After correction for confounding variables including aspirin and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use was still associated with a reduced incidence of OAC (OR 0.57, 0.28-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Longer duration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use and higher doses were both associated with a significantly greater reduction in OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination of regular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> and aspirin use was associated with a significantly further reduced incidence of OAC (OR 0.31, 0.04-0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this observational case-control study, the regular use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> was associated with a reduced incidence of OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The chemopreventative actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, especially in conjunction with aspirin, deserve further study </plain></SENT>
