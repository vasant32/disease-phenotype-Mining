<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we attempted to reverse Barrett's epithelium in an acid-reduced environment by using multipolar electrocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had specialized columnar epithelium of at least 2 cm in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on successive screening examinations were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal motility and 24-hour pH studies were performed before therapy and at 9 and 18 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> 30 mg twice a day regardless of pH study results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multipolar electrocoagulation was applied to one side of the esophagus (2 to 3 cm per session) with the contralateral side serving as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were obtained from each 2 cm length at each endoscopy and reviewed by a single, blinded pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the 9-week evaluation of the treatment side, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients elected to undergo multipolar electrocoagulation therapy for the control side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients completed the study: 21 men and 6 women, ages 33 to 81 years, length of specialized columnar epithelium 2 to 10 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy at the 18-week follow-up showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (n = 16), residual small (&lt; 3 mm) islands or tongue-shaped extensions of apparent specialized columnar epithelium (n = 7), untreated distal strips (&lt; 5 mm) of apparent specialized columnar epithelium at the gastroesophageal junction (n = 3), and persistent specialized columnar epithelium (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histologically, only 5 of 27 patients had residual specialized columnar epithelium at week 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of 16 patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endoscopic appearance, one still had specialized columnar epithelium on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>While on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi>, pH studies were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 15 of 26 patients at 9 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of 22 patients with histologic evidence of specialized columnar epithelium reversal, 10 had persistently abnormal 24-hour pH studies (pH &lt; 4, 6.1% to 33.7% of total time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Four of five patients with residual specialized columnar epithelium on biopsy had persistent reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Side effects of multipolar electrocoagulation were transient, and treatment did not adversely alter motility patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multipolar electrocoagulation therapy can induce re-epithelialization with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa in most patients with specialized columnar epithelium and does not adversely affect esophageal motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Adequate acid suppression is not mandatory for therapy to be effective in the short term </plain></SENT>
