<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) are commonly treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) to minimize the exposure of esophageal mucosa to stomach acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the use of these medications can lead to significant hypergastrinemia in a subset of patients, which is concerning due to the known tumorigenic and proliferative effects of gastrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present pilot study aims to investigate a potential correlation between serum gastrin and cellular proliferation in BE.Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of patients with nondysplastic BE on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum gastrin was measured on the same day as esophageal biopsies were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These biopsies were then stained with Ki-67 nuclear antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relationship between Ki-67 index and ln(gastrin).Results: A total of 10 patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 62.6 (±8.4) years and 5 patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median serum gastrin level was 45.2 pM (interquartile range [IQR] 33-113) and the median Ki-67 index was 49.6% (IQR 23-64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a statistically significant positive correlation between Ki-67 index and ln(gastrin) (r = 0.64; p = 0.05).Conclusions: In nondysplastic BE patients on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy, serum gastrin levels were significantly correlated with cellular proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These pilot data lend support to a potential causal effect of gastrin on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies of patients with BE are needed to determine whether hypergastrinemia is a risk factor for the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or could be used as a biomarker for disease progression </plain></SENT>
