<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population included 307 patients who were enrolled in a prospective case-control study to evaluate lifestyle risk factors and molecular alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (n = 126 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 125 patients), and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 56 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A control group included 95 strictly asymptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from cases and controls, and polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify exon 4 of CCND1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After digestion with BsrI, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis was used to identify the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and common G870A polymorphic alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of alleles (G/G, G/A, A/A) was compared between cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to study cyclin D1 distribution in among patients in the case group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the asymptomatic control group, and adjusted for age and gender, increasing frequencies were seen for the A/A genotype in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR], 2.83; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.09-7.34), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.46-9.29), and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OR, 5.99; 95% CI, 1.86-18.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association was seen between genotype and cyclin D1 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CCND1 A/A genotype was associated with increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The contribution of this polymorphism to susceptibility of defined stages of progression to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> suggested potential application in endoscopic Barrett surveillance programs </plain></SENT>
