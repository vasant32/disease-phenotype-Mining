<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As there has been no previous information on the consequences of telomerase expression in genetically altered, mortal cells derived from pre-malignant tissue, we sought to determine the effect of hTERT (human catalytic subunit of telomerase reverse transcriptase) transduction of pre-malignant cell strains from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> that do not contain telomerase activity and possess a finite lifespan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary cultures of Barrett's esophageal epithelium transduced with a retrovirus containing hTERT were characterized by growth factor requirements, cytogenetics and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of telomerase lengthened telomeres and greatly extended the lifespan of hTERT transduced (hTERT+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Growth factor dependency of the hTERT+ cultures remained largely similar to the parental cultures, although there was a modest increase in the ability to grow in agar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>Chromosomal instability</z:mp>, measured by both karyotypic and FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) analyses, was reduced but not abrogated by hTERT transduction, suggesting that telomerase expression can enhance genomic stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the persistence of residual instability gave rise to new clonal and non-clonal genetic variants, and in one hTERT+ culture a new DNA aneuploid population was observed, the only time such a ploidy shift has been seen in Barrett's cell strains in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These in vitro observations are analogous to the clinical progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> that often precedes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and suggest that reactivation of telomerase may be permissive for continued genetic evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-lived <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> epithelial cultures should provide a useful in vitro model for studies of neoplastic evolution and chemopreventive therapies </plain></SENT>
