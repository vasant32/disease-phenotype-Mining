<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> screening and surveillance, however, require a large number of patients to undergo potentially burdensome tests with only some experiencing health gains from it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the determinants of patients' reported burden of upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy by comparing data from three patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 476 patients were included: 180 patients under regular surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), a premalignant disorder; 214 patients with non-specific upper GI symptoms (NS), and 82 patients recently diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0814138" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">upper GI cancer</z:e> (CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed pain, discomfort and overall burden experienced during endoscopy, symptoms in the week afterwards and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> over time (Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> scale and Impact of Event Scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two-thirds (66%) of patients reported discomfort and overall burden of upper GI endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 23% reported any pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BE patients reported significantly less discomfort, pain and overall burden than the other patients: those with NS reported more discomfort, CA patients more pain, and both more overall burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences could be statistically explained by the number of previous endoscopies and whether sedation was provided or not, but not by patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The perception of upper GI endoscopy varies by patient group, due to potential adaptation after multiple endoscopies and aspects of the procedure </plain></SENT>
