<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) is predominant type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> worldwide comprising almost 95% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> is prevalent in the developing world, esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is commonly seen in the developed country, usually in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In spite of its higher prevalence, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> has not been studied as intensively as esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> are common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> worldwide with poor survival rate among patients mainly because both of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> lack early biomarkers of identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular mechanisms contributing to initiation and progression of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> are still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Development of DNA microarray technology allows high-throughput identification of gene expression profiles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In order to identify molecules as candidates for early diagnosis and/or as therapeutic targets, we analyzed the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression profiles of 20 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> using whole genome DNA microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 2,235 genes were differentially regulated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> as compared to the corresponding adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium of which 881 were significantly upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We validated two molecules that were not previously reported to be overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153381" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oral cancer</z:e> overexpressed 2 (ORAOV2) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), by immunohistochemical labeling of tissue microarrays and archival tissue sections and found that they were overexpressed in 98% (116/118) and 68% (79/116) of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By gene enrichment analysis, we identified significant downregulation of several genes in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, using this approach we have identified a number of promising novel candidates that can be validated further for their potential to serve as biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
