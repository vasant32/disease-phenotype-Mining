<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is a pre-neoplastic lesion, which develops as a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> and predisposes the patient to oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to characterize karyotypic changes that may occur during the progression of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> through low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The technique of comparative genomic hybridization was used to characterize genome-wide changes in biopsies from patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> plus high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both fresh and archival material was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparative genomic hybridization revealed a large amount of widespread chromosome instability at the high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant chromosome changes were detectable by comparative genomic hybridization in patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic changes in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients were more specific than those found in the high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 4 was amplified most often in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and chromosome 8q was amplified most frequently in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is the stage exhibiting widespread chromosome instability, which is detectable by comparative genomic hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This instability is undetectable in low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The chromosome variation seen at high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> may be the source of more specific karyotypes that progress to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we have identified chromosome 4 amplification as being heavily involved in the initiation of Barrett's progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Specific chromosome changes (4 and 8q) may represent important regions on which to focus attention in future studies, with a view to identifying diagnostic markers </plain></SENT>
