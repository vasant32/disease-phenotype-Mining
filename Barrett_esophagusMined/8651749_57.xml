<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a well-recognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is controversy with regard to the optimal treatment of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recognizing the morbidity and mortality associated with esophagectomy, some recommend a selective approach, reserving esophagectomy only for evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> identified through endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other advocate esophagectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suitable operative candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed their experience between 1985 and 1995 with 11 patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy and treated by esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were white men ranging in age from 47 to 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten patients underwent esophagectomy by the Ivor Lewis technique; one had a transhiatal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (73%) had invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> identified after esophagectomy; two (18%) had positive lymph nodes; one required a prolonged hospital stay for an anastomotic leak; two (18%) temporarily suffered <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>delayed gastric emptying</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors' review identified 85 additional patients previously reported during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Including the current series, 39 patients (41%) had invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> identified in the resected specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A preponderance of early, potentially curable <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> are characteristically found in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A high incidence of endoscopically undetected invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> strongly supports esophagectomy as the preferred approach for suitable operative candidates with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
