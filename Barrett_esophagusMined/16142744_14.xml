<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The esophagus is the most commonly affected gastrointestinal area in systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SSc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with SSc frequently develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, esophageal injury, and sometimes, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), which may increase the risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine the prevalence of BE and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in a cohort of SSc patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred ten SSc patients who were receiving long-term treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) were assessed systematically by esophageal manometry and endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal biopsies were performed when macroscopic abnormalities were detected, and BE was diagnosed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 110 patients, 14 had BE (12.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with BE had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, but 3 of the 14 patients (21%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on esophageal biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar proportions of patients with and without BE had abnormal peristalsis and decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association between BE and other disease characteristics was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, 12.7% of SSc patients who had been treated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> for long periods had BE, similar to the prevalence in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although none of the patients had esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, patients with BE should be followed up closely, particularly patients with dysplasic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term prospective studies are warranted to determine the phenotype of SSc patients at high risk of developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
