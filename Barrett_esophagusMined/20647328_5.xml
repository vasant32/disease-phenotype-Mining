<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reflux-induced injury promotes esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, one of the most rapidly increasing, highly lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the efficacy of a combinatorial chemoprevention strategy for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifically, our approach involves the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9907">ursodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (Urso) due to its ability to decrease injury-inducing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> in combination with Aspirin to mitigate the consequences of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We find that Urso-Aspirin combination reduces the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in vivo in animals with reflux, decreases the proliferation of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells, and downregulates a key cell cycle regulator, CDK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, using cell growth, luciferase reporter, expression, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we identify GLI1, a Hedgehog-regulated transcription factor, as a novel target of Urso-Aspirin combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that GLI1 is upregulated during esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, and GLI1 can bind to the CDK2 promoter and activate its expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the Urso-Aspirin combination downregulates GLI1, the GLI1 overexpression not only abrogates the effect of this combination on proliferation but it also restores CDK-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings support that the chemopreventive effect of the Urso-Aspirin combination occurs, at least in part, through a novel GLI1-CDK2-dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To further understand the regulation of CDK2 by GLI1, both pharmacologic and RNAi-mediated approaches show that GLI1 is a transcriptional activator of CDK2, and this regulation occurs independent of Smoothened, the central transducer of the Hedgehog canonical pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results identify a novel GLI1-to-CDK2 pathway in esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, which is a bona fide target for effective combinatorial chemoprevention with Urso and Aspirin </plain></SENT>
