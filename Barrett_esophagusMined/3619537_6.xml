<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixteen adult patients with congenital esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were operated on between 1957 and 1979 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, 7 patients (44%) were asymptomatic and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> was found incidentally on a routine chest roentgenogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Esophageal symptoms were present in only 3 patients (19%), whereas most symptomatic patients had precordial sensations or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After enucleation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath>, preoperative symptoms were alleviated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and short-term results were excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, long-term follow-up 13.2 +/- 5.6 (+/- standard deviation) years later revealed moderate reflux in 9 (64%) of the surviving 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During esophagoscopy, macroscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was found in 12 (92%) of 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On histological examination of specimens obtained by forceps biopsy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was present in 10 (77%) of 13 patients and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, despite excellent early results, long-term follow-up of patients who undergo operation for congenital esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> is indicated because of the increased incidence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
