<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cause for this increase in incidence is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study was designed to investigate potential risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus and gastric cardia and to compare the risk profiles of a group of patients with this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with those having distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>stomach cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 95 incident cases with the pathological diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus and gastric cardia, 67 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the distal stomach, and 132 cancerfree controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center from November 1, 1992 to November 1, 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological data were collected by a modified National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Health Habits History Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk factors were analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel methods and a logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of esophagus and gastric cardia after controlling for age, sex, race, education, pack-years of smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, and total dietary intake of calories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of esophagus and gastric cardia was associated with age, male gender, and Caucasian race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tobacco smoking was related to a modest risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of esophagus and gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the risk of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>stomach cancer</z:hpo> was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>stomach ulcers</z:hpo> and pack-years of cigarette smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Iron deficiency</z:e> was significantly associated with increased risk of both <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus and gastric cardia and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the distal stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No obvious associations were identified for occupational exposures, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and physical activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that medical conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> may be related to the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of esophagus and gastric cardia and confirms the moderate risk associated with tobacco smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated an etiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> with respect to risk factors identified between <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of esophagus and gastric cardia and those of the distal stomach </plain></SENT>
