<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accurate tools to determine risk are needed to optimize surveillance and intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the ability of candidate biomarkers to predict which cases of BE will progress to EAC or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and identified those that can be measured in formalin-fixed tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from a nested case-control study performed using the population-based Northern Ireland BE Register (1993-2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases who progressed to EAC (n = 89) or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> â‰¥ 6 months after diagnosis with BE were matched to controls (nonprogressors, n = 291), for age, sex, and year of BE diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Established biomarkers (abnormal DNA content, p53, and cyclin A expression) and new biomarkers (levels of sialyl Lewis(a), Lewis(x), and Aspergillus oryzae lectin [AOL] and binding of wheat germ agglutinin) were assessed in paraffin-embedded tissue samples from patients with a first diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression analysis was applied to assess odds of progression for patients with dysplastic and nondysplastic BE, based on biomarker status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biomarkers tested, other than Lewis(x), were associated with risk of EAC or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In backward selection, a panel comprising low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, abnormal DNA ploidy, and AOL most accurately identified progressors and nonprogressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratio for progression of patients with BE with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 3.74 (95% confidence interval, 2.43-5.79) for each additional biomarker and the risk increased by 2.99 for each additional factor (95% confidence interval, 1.72-5.20) in patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, abnormal DNA ploidy, and AOL can be used to identify patients with BE most likely to develop EAC or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
