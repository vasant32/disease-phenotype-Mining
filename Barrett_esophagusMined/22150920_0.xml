<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a small cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> (EC) patients treated with surgery, H-BMI and diagnosis of early stage EC appeared associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a much larger cohort of EC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From a prospectively maintained database, we analyzed 925 EC patients who had surgery with or without adjunctive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Various statistical methods were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 925 patients, 69% had H-BMI, and 31% had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body mass index (&lt;25 kg/m(2) ; N-BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>H-BMI was associated with men (P&lt;0.001), Caucasians (P=0.064; trend), lower esophageal localization (P&lt;0.001), <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> histology (P&lt;0.001), low baseline cT-stage (P=0.003), low baseline overall clinical stage (P=0.003), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (P=0.036), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>N-BMI was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e> (P=0.056; trend), ever/current smoking (P=0.014), and baseline cN+ (P=0.018) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median survival of N-BMI patients was 36.66 months compared with 53.20 months for H-BMI patients (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, older age (P&lt;0.001), squamous histology (P=0.002), smoking (P=0.040), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (P=0.002), high baseline stage (P&lt;0.001), high number of ypN+ (P=0.005), high surgical stage (P&lt;0.001), and American Society of Anesthesia scores, three out of four (P&lt;0.001) were independent prognosticators for poor overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We were able to perform propensity-based analysis of surgical complications between H-BMI and N-BMI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A comparison of fully matched 376 patients (188 with H-BMI and 188 with N-BMI) found no significant differences in the rate of complications between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This larger data set confirms that a fraction of H-BMI patients with antecedent history is diagnosed with early baseline EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Upon validation of our data in an independent cohort, refinements in surveillance of symptomatic H-BMI patients are warranted and could be implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our data also suggest that H-BMI patients do not experience higher rate of surgical complications compared with N-BMI patients </plain></SENT>
