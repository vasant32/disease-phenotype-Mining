<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Current models of clonal expansion in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> are based upon heterogenous, flow-purified biopsy analysis taken at multiple segment levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of identical mutation fingerprints from these biopsy samples led to the proposal that a mutated clone with a selective advantage can clonally expand to fill an entire Barrett's segment at the expense of competing clones (selective sweep to fixation model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess clonality at a much higher resolution by microdissecting and genetically analysing individual crypts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histogenesis of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and neo-squamous islands has never been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the oesophageal gland squamous ducts as the source of both epithelial sub-types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individual crypts across Barrett's biopsy and oesophagectomy blocks were dissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Determination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor gene loss of heterozygosity patterns, p16 and p53 point mutations were carried out on a crypt-by-crypt basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases of contiguous neo-squamous islands and columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> with oesophageal squamous ducts were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tissues were isolated by laser capture microdissection and genetically analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Individual crypt dissection revealed mutation patterns that were masked in whole biopsy analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dissection across oesophagectomy specimens demonstrated marked clonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, with multiple independent clones present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We identified a p16 point mutation arising in the squamous epithelium of the oesophageal gland duct, which was also present in a contiguous metaplastic crypt, whereas neo-squamous islands arising from squamous ducts were <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> with respect to surrounding Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By studying clonality at the crypt level we demonstrate that Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> arises from multiple independent clones, in contrast to the selective sweep to fixation model of clonal expansion previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the squamous gland ducts situated throughout the oesophagus are the source of a progenitor cell that may be susceptible to gene mutation resulting in conversion to Barrett's metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these data suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ducts may be the source of neo-squamous islands </plain></SENT>
