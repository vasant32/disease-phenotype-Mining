<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The German version of the Minimal Standard Terminology document for endoscopy was discussed in 1997 and 1998, and finally published at the end of 1999 as one of the German Gastroenterology Society guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses and descriptive terms included in this standard terminology are based on the consensus views of a large number of German endoscopists (20 endoscopists based in Munich and 20 elsewhere in Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate how much spontaneous compliance there is with the descriptive terms included in the standard terminology - both among the members of the consensus discussions, and among colleagues not involved in this project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 881 endoscopy reports with the diagnoses of reflux, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> were collected from 11 centers (2 hospitals and 9 private offices, with a total of 26 examiners) over a one-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 26 examiners were actively involved in the terminology consensus discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of occurrence of the descriptive terms contained in the standard terminology was assessed for the diagnoses listed above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compliance with the descriptive terms was high (&gt; 90 %) only for basic parameters such as the Savary classification of reflux and the area in which <z:mp ids='MP_0003301'>gastroduodenal ulcers</z:mp> were located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other important parameters, such as the extent (length) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> size, and circumferential location, were reported in only three-quarters of cases or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The descriptions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> were inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the degree of compliance either between endoscopists using free dictation and those using computerized text blocks, or between members of the terminology group and those not involved in preparing the terminology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to standard terminology and its descriptive parameters is poor even among specialized gastroenterologists who have been involved in terminology consensus discussions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compliance needs to be improved by providing suitable software programs with automatic reporting functions </plain></SENT>
