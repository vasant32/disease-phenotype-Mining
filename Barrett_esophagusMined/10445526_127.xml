<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Surveillance of Barrett's patients is recommended, to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reported risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> varies substantially, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous analysis used an average <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence of 1/75 patient-years (PY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent reports suggest that the risk may range from 1/251 to 1/208 PY in combined series of patients with long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (LSBE, &gt;3 cm), and short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE), and up to 1% annually in patients with SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to consider these new estimates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in a cost-utility analysis of surveillance of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using our previously published model, we incorporated an average of the recent estimates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk (0.4% annually, 1/227 PY), and our primary data on quality of life after esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We included actual variable (direct) costs and used a discount rate of 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the perspective of an HMO, the model evaluates surveillance every 1-5 yr and no surveillance, with esophagectomy performed if high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is diagnosed, and calculates the incremental cost-utility ratios for each strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results suggest that, at our baseline, annual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk surveillance every 5 yr is the only viable strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More frequent surveillance costs more and yields a lower life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-utility ratio for surveillance every 5 yr is $98,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, comparable to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of accepted practices (heart transplantation and screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> in selected populations, $160,000/LY gained and $216,000/LY gained, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of Barrett's patients should extend life, with incremental cost-utility ratios that compare favorably with some accepted medical practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Policy makers can compare the cost of surveillance to that of other accepted practices to determine their willingness to fund surveillance </plain></SENT>
