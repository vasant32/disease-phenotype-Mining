<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The IGF-II gene normally exhibits <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, a DNA modification that allows the expression of only one of the two inherited alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With loss of imprinting, there is a gain of allelic gene expression (GOAGE) due to IGF-II being expressed by both alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GOAGE for IGF-II has been demonstrated in a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelia surrounding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, but not in epithelia without associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that nonneoplastic Barrett's epithelium might have GOAGE for IGF-II that could facilitate its progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic biopsies were obtained from metaplastic esophageal, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> duodenal epithelia from 43 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA were analyzed using PCR followed by ApaI restriction enzyme digestion or allele-specific PCR to identify an ApaI polymorphism of IGF-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>cDNA from patients with the ApaI polymorphism were analyzed for IGF-II GOAGE using exon connection PCR, followed by a secondary nested PCR and ApaI restriction enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that 13 (30%) of 43 samples of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> contained the ApaI polymorphism and were thus informative for IGF-II, and sufficient material was available for GOAGE analysis in 9 of those 13 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GOAGE for IGF-II was demonstrated in five (56%) of those nine cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with GOAGE in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> also demonstrated GOAGE in the gastric and duodenal epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients without GOAGE in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> also had no GOAGE in their gastric and duodenal epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, GOAGE for IGF-II is found frequently in the metaplastic esophageal epithelium as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric and duodenal epithelia </plain></SENT>
