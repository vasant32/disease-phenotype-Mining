<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a condition in which the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by metaplastic columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BE is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> because it is the initiating factor in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of the proliferation-associated molecule cyclin E was immunohistochemically determined in metaplastic specialized epithelium (SE; n = 24), low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD; n = 21), high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD; n = 17), and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (CA; n = 35) from 36 esophagectomy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, endoscopically obtained samples of SE with minimal inflammatory changes (n = 11) and SE adjacent to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> or ulcerations were tested for cyclin E expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the surgical specimens, expression of cyclin E was found in 0 of 24 SE (0%), 2 of 21 LGD (9.5%), 3 of 17 HGD (17.6%), and 5 of 35 CA (14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the biopsy specimens, expression of cyclin E was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples adjacent to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> or ulcerations, whereas SE with minimal inflammatory changes was invariably negative for cyclin E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Accumulation of cyclin E can be found by means of immunohistochemistry in premalignant and malignant lesions in BE as well as in regenerative metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The determination of cyclin E expression is therefore not useful in the identification of BE patients with an increased risk for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
