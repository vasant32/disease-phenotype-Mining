<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent research has elucidated multiple other risk factors for both EAC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Utilization of these risk factors may allow for the selection of a screening population with a much higher pre-test probability of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A recently developed risk-prediction model for BE is a significant step in the right direction; however, further refinements in this model will likely be necessary to optimize utility </plain></SENT>
