<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adverse events associated with the thermal ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) include the generation of gastric mucosa buried beneath the neosquamous regrowth, and unrecognized development and growth of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No reports exist regarding the endoscopic appearance and histology of the cardia before and after BE ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess the relative frequency of the occurrence of visible endoscopic and histologic changes in the cardia, before and after complete BE ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A subset analysis of patients with uncomplicated BE, BE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, or early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, who had been enrolled into one of 4 ongoing prospective studies of mucosal ablation, was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two patients were identified who entered a BE ablation study, with 75 of these completing BE mucosal ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardia biopsy specimens were taken in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before ablation and serially after BE ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardia histology was graded by using the modified Sydney System for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before ablation, cardia nodules were noted in 3, cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) in 7 (8.5%), and none harbored cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postablation surveillance ranged from 3 to 75 months (mean 31.1 months [19.5]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six subjects (8%) developed cardia nodules during surveillance; cardia IM was found in 21(28%), with 17 of these being a new finding (incidence of 25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cardia low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> incidence was 1.3% and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 4% after BE ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pathophysiology of the abnormal cardia histology and the endoscopic lesions (nodules) is unclear, but endoscopic surveillance of not only the neosquamous epithelium but also the cardia should be considered after ablation, especially in those high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> BE patients </plain></SENT>
