<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the tunica mucosa may be an initiating factor of alteration of focal tissue 'niches,' where dormant stem cells locate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated whether Musashi-1 is expressed in the esophagus and its relation to immune <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 41 esophageal tissue specimens from 41 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 15 were esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 17 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and 7 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>), and 9 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus tissue specimens from patients without esophageal pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies to Musashi-1 and to a set of cell type-specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multiplexed tandem polymerase chain reaction method was used to measure the relative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of Musashi-1 and the specific dendritic cell marker dendritic cell-specific intercellular molecule-3 (ICAM-3)-grabbing nonintegrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of small numbers of Musashi-1+ cells scattered in the connective tissue stroma and within the epithelium in cardiac-type glands in biopsies from patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Musashi-1 expression was present in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and in dysplastic Barrett's in which the majority of epithelial cells in individual glands expressed this antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of Musashi-1 was highest in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, where it was most intense in glands that displayed features of early stages of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> formation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Musashi-1 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> tissues </plain></SENT>
