<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> have an increased risk of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> but this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> only accounts for a small proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> are reportedly raised in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined cause specific mortality among individuals in a population based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We constructed a register of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with columnar mucosa (including specialised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) of the oesophagus within Northern Ireland between 1993 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> occurring within this cohort until 31 December 2000 were identified and mortality rates were compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall mortality was not raised in Barrett's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During 7413 person years of follow up in 2373 patients there were 253 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 84-107)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> was raised in patients with specialised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SMR 774 (95% CI 317-1231)) but only 4.7% of patients died from this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (SMR 65 (95% CI 37-93)) was significantly lower than the general population while mortality from non-cancerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">digestive system diseases</z:e> was significantly higher (SMR 211 (95% CI 111-311)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other causes were similar to those of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the overall mortality rate in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is closely similar to that of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Oesophageal cancer</z:e> mortality was raised but is an uncommon cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in these patients who also appear to have a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
