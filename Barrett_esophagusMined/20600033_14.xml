<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent uncontrolled study found that ETMI improved the detection of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (Ca) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to compare ETMI with standard video endoscopy (SVE) for the detection of HGD/Ca with the use of a randomized cross-over design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients referred for work-up of inconspicuous HGD/Ca were eligible and underwent both SVE and ETMI in randomized order within an interval of 6-12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During ETMI, inspection with HRE was followed by AFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detected lesions were inspected in detail with NBI and biopsied, followed by random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During SVE, any visible lesion was biopsied followed by random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with BE underwent ETMI and SVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in overall histologic yield between ETMI and SVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ETMI had a significantly higher targeted yield compared with SVE because of AFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the yield of targeted biopsies of ETMI was significantly inferior to the overall yield of SVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Detailed inspection with NBI reduced the false-positive rate of HRE + AFI from 71% to 48% but misclassified 17% of HGD/Ca lesions as not suspicious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ETMI statistically significant improves the targeted detection of HGD/Ca compared with SVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Subsequent characterization of lesions with NBI appears to be of limited value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At this stage, ETMI cannot replace random biopsies for detection of lesions or targeted biopsies for characterization of lesions in a high-risk population </plain></SENT>
