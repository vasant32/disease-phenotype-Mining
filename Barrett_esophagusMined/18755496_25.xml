<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many publications focusing on the background or original mucosa of Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> have maintained that <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arises in intestinal-type mucosa with goblet cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e>, and this has become a central dogma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mucosa on each side of a series of 141 minute esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) resected by endoscopic mucosal resection was recorded as the background mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 141 cases had endoscopic evidence of an esophageal origin, and for 113 of them, histologic evidence of an esophageal origin was also available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mucosae were classified into 4 types--squamous, cardiac, fundic, and intestinal--based on routine histology and immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present joint pathologic examination of the background mucosa of Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> conducted by Japanese and German pathologists and gastroenterologists found that more than 70% of primary small <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (&lt;2 cm) of the esophagus were adjacent to cardiac/fundic-type rather than intestinal-type mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was not observed in any areas of the endoscopic mucosal resection specimens in 64 (56.6%) of the 113 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In other words, there was no evidence to support the previously held view that Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is nearly always accompanied and preceded by intestinal-type mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study has demonstrated a close relationship between esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and cardiac-type mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is not proven histogenetically that the background mucosa of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is the intestinal type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, it seems better to define <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> as metaplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> alone, without requiring the presence of goblet cells, in accordance with histogenetic and practical standpoints </plain></SENT>
