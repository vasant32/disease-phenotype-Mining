<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of CLOs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and to consider their role, if any, in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the bacteria were identified in 38 specimens obtained from 34 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the incidence of CLOs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> must be low and that CLOs do not contribute to the natural history of the disease </plain></SENT>
