<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The events involved in the transformation from squamous to Barrett's epithelium remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study describes the characteristics observed during the recurrence of four cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Red velvet, gastric-like, esophageal mucosa was observed to develop above the anastomosis during follow-up of four patients submitted to surgery for esophageal and junctional <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The areas of recurrence were associated with reflux symptoms and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, with ulceration in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies from the upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were examined histologically using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff/Alcian blue to detect acid mucins and a monoclonal antibody raised against the enterocytic enzyme sucrase-isomaltase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the recurrent columnar-lined segments displayed intestinal features recognized morphologically, histochemically, and/or immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of specialized columnar epithelium in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient developed specialized columnar epithelium during the tenth year of surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of AB-positive columnar cells was a frequent and early event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Columnar cells with unequivocal apical sucrase-isomaltase were observed only in association with specialized columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four conclusions were reached: that the development of columnar-lined mucosa without specialized columnar epithelium may be the earliest event in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>; that histochemistry is a useful method of recognizing a population with cryptic intestinal features; that acid mucin secretion precedes the production of enterocytic enzymes by columnar cells; and that a cell population with enterocytic differentiation, as assessed by sucrase-isomaltase expression, is associated with the development of specialized columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> development are clinically relevant as they suggest that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> without specialized columnar epithelium may acquire 'true' intestinal phenotype, justifying them being considered as high- risk patients </plain></SENT>
