<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: EMR for early neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is gaining favor over esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>Esophageal stricture</z:hpo> development has been reported as a common complication of EMR, photodynamic therapy, and combination endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and procedural predictors of symptomatic stricture formation after EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary-care referral university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Data were retrospectively reviewed on 73 patients at our institution who underwent EMR monotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> since January 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> formation was noted in 24.7% of patients undergoing EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stricture formation on univariate analysis was associated with percentage of circumference of esophageal lumen resected, total pieces resected, number of EMR sessions, and tobacco use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A threshold effect was found at 50% of esophageal circumference resected (66.7% vs 27.2% developed strictures above and below the threshold, respectively; P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A 25-pack-year or greater history of tobacco use had a threshold effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> formation (77.8% vs 7.2% developed strictures above and below the threshold, respectively; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, resection of &gt;50% of the circumference was strongly associated with stricture formation (odds ratio [OR] 4.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-13.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A 25-pack-year or greater history of tobacco use also trended toward stricture formation (OR 3.33; 95% CI, 0.929-12.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design, sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Resection of at least 50% of the esophageal mucosal circumference is strongly associated with stricture formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients with strong histories of tobacco use also may be more likely to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> following EMR </plain></SENT>
