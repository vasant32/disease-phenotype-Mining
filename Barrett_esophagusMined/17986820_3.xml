<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to compare the current prevalence of upper gastrointestinal endoscopic findings to the prevalence 15 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data about endoscopic findings of consecutive patients for the first time referred for open-access upper gastrointestinal endoscopy between January 2002 and December 2004 was collected from medical files </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of each specific finding was compared with data described in three historical populations about 15 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The current and historical study population consisted of 1,286 and 3,062 subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenitis</z:e> significantly decreased by 12.6% (95% CI: 14.5-10.7) and 2.9% (95% CI: 4.5-1.3), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the prevalence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> both significantly increased by 6.9% (95% CI: 4.2-9.6) and 2.1% (95% CI: 0.8-4.4), respectively </plain></SENT>
