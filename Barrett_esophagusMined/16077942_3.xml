<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the expression of mucin and the Ki-67 labeling index (LI) in 15 cases of esophageal Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and clarified the significance of incomplete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of Barrett's mucosa as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gastric mucin (MUC5AC, HGM, and/or MUC6) was detected in 93.3% of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, while MUC2 and CD10 (markers of intestinal phenotypes) were detected in 73.3% and 46.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Ki-67 LI was 34.1% in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, gastric mucin was found in the non-neoplastic Barrett's mucosa around the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MUC2 was detected in 86.7% of proximal non-neoplastic mucosa and 100% of distal non-neoplastic mucosa, while CD10 was found in 20.0% of proximal non-neoplastic mucosa and 40.0% of distal non-neoplastic mucosa of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Barrett's esophageal mucosa with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and a high Ki-67 LI is suggested to be more important as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e>, and predominantly found in the proximal rather than distal region of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
