<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, true esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368019" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Paget disease</z:e> (intraepithelial growth of neoplastic cells with glandular differentiation) has only rarely been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We encountered 3 endoscopic biopsy specimens containing Paget cells in squamous epithelium associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and in the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the prevalence of Paget cells in the esophagus, we studied 81 endoscopic mucosal resections and 27 esophagectomies from patients with invasive or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and compared the findings to a control group of 47 endoscopic mucosal resections and 25 esophagectomies from patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paget cells were present in squamous epithelium overlying 5 (4.9%) of 108 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> but in none (0%) of 72 BE with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P=0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A computerized search for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368019" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Paget disease</z:e> using the terms "Paget's and esophagus" or "pagetoid and esophagus" from 1994 to 2007 did not yield any additional cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 8 patients with Paget cells (including the 2 index biopsies) there were no differences in either sex distribution (7M:1F) or age (mean 62.4 y) as compared with 103 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> without Paget cells (93M:10F, P=0.58; mean age 69.2 y, P=0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> with Paget cells contained at least a component of diffuse, poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and 1 was a signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Paget cells involved only squamous epithelium directly above the poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histochemistry for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff with diastase (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-D) and mucicarmine, and immunohistochemistry for CK7, CK20, p53, and E-cadherin, were performed on 7 Paget cases with the following results: <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-D+ (7 of 7, 100%), mucicarmine+ (6 of 7, 86%), CK7+ (7 of 7, 100%), CK20+ (5 of 7, 71%), p53 overexpression (3 of 7, 43%), and E-cadherin loss (complete loss in 1 and faint expression in 3, 57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-D was the most efficacious stain for highlighting Paget cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A control group of 19 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> without Paget cells were also stained for E-cadherin; only 1 showed faint expression (5%) and none showed complete loss (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate a low but significant prevalence (4.9%) of Paget cells in esophageal and esophagogastric junction <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Unlike previously described cases of mammary, vulvar, and perianal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368019" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Paget disease</z:e>, esophageal Paget cells are almost universally associated with underlying <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and not with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> ("in situ" disease) or primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368019" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Paget disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A commonality among cases with Paget cells is the presence of focal or diffuse, poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with discohesive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>E-cadherin alterations seem to play a less significant role </plain></SENT>
