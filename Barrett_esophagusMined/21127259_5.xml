<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e>, where <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium is replaced by intestinal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BE is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the BE cell of origin is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that BE tissue originates from esophageal squamous cells, which can differentiate to columnar cells as a result of repeated exposure to gastric acid and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi>, two components of refluxate implicated in BE pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we repeatedly exposed squamous esophageal HET1A cells to 0.2 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> (BA) cocktail at pH 5.5 and developed an HET1AR-resistant cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cells are able to survive and proliferate after repeated 2-h treatments with BA at pH 5.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HET1AR cells are resistant to acidification and express markers of columnar differentiation, villin, CDX2, and cytokeratin 8/18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HET1AR cells have increased amounts of reactive oxygen species, concomitant with a decreased level and activity of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase compared with parental cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HET1AR cells express proteins and activate signaling pathways associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, cell survival, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> that are thought to contribute to BE and EAC development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These include STAT3, NF-ÎºB, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, phosphorylated mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (p-mTOR), and Mcl-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of prosurvival and inflammatory proteins and resistance to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> could be partially modified by inhibition of STAT3 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, our study shows that long-term exposure of squamous cells to BA at acidic pH causes the cells to display the same characteristics and markers as BE </plain></SENT>
