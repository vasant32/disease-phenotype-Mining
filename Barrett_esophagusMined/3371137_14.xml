<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that patients with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> are distinguished by an accumulation of acid mucosal contact time during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data would suggest that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> should have particularly severe impairment of acid clearance, most notable during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, 16 asymptomatic healthy volunteers and 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acid clearance was assessed by timing the reestablishment of an esophageal pH of 4 following the infusion of 15 ml 0.1 N HCl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sleep was polygraphically monitored in order to objectively determine sleep and waking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that while patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had a marked increase in the frequency of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> during sleep, they unexpectedly demonstrated faster acid clearance times during both waking and sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A greater percentage of arousal responses to acid infusion during sleep was noted in the Barrett's group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded from these results that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> can adequately clear acid from the distal esophagus but experience considerable acid mucosal contact through repeated episodes of spontaneous reflux during sleep </plain></SENT>
