<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> may develop despite effective medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> has a multifactorial etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, medical treatment may not prevent complications of reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-three patients with reflux disease and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were prospectively studied for the development of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> while receiving long-term therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> and cisapride </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only patients who had effective control of reflux symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surveillance time was 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcome of these 83 patients was compared with that of 42 patients in whom antireflux surgery was performed with a median follow-up of 3.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve (14.5%) patients developed Barrett's while receiving medical therapy; this was not seen after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients developing Barrett's had a weaker lower esophageal sphincter and peristalsis before treatment than patients with uncomplicated disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Antireflux surgery is superior to medical therapy in the prevention of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, patients with reflux disease who have a weak lower esophageal sphincter and poor esophageal peristalsis should undergo antireflux surgery, even if they have only mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
