<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three 4 microm thick sections were used for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining and for immunostaining with antibodies against GST alpha and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
