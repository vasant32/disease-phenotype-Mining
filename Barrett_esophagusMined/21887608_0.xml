<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the finding of asymptomatic oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> detected at pre-operative endoscopy in our unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from a prospectively maintained database concerning the period May 2003 to October 2010 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 371 patients who had undergone upper GI endoscopy prior to gastric banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy reports were reviewed to identify any pathology detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopy revealed abnormalities in 207 (56%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A range of abnormalities were detected, the most significant of which were two asymptomatic oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The detection of two early, asymptomatic oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in a high risk patient group justifies our policy of routine upper GI endoscopy prior to gastric banding surgery </plain></SENT>
