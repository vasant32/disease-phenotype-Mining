<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of 5-LOX pathway proteins in oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and its <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e>, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue samples were collected at endoscopy from 16 patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and from seven with oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; five proximal squamous oesophagus samples were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses were performed on stromal and epithelial areas with optimized concentrations of primary antibodies for 5-LOX, 5-LOX-activating protein (FLAP), and the distal enzymes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> (LT) A(4) hydrolase (LTA(4) H) and LTC(4) synthase (LTC(4) S). the diagnosis was histologically confirmed from adjacent sections by a gastrointestinal pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Striking increases in the stromal immunoexpression of 5-LOX (P = 0.041), FLAP (P = 0.038), LTA(4) H (P = 0.0008) and LTC(4) S (P = 0.036) were seen in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stromal FLAP and LTA(4) H immunostaining correlated with elevated neutrophil counts (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LTC(4) S was also notably overexpressed within epithelial cells in both Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.001) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.01) tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Key biosynthetic enzymes of the LTB(4) and LTC(4) biosynthetic pathways are incrementally expressed across the spectrum of squamous, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissues, suggesting, for the first time, a role for both LT subfamilies in disease progression </plain></SENT>
