<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The criteria of its diagnosis, occurrence and possible influence on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">esophageal reflux disease</z:e> are still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper is to research the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> based on endoscopic criteria of its diagnosis and its influence on other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: More than 729 patients, to whom endoscopy was made, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The accepted endoscopic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and other lesions which could be related to it and other characteristic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">esophageal reflux disease</z:e> were searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the basis of accepted diagnostic criteria the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 44.16% of men and in 42.77% of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> occurrence in relation to age, gender and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">esophageal reflux disease</z:e> were found in 36.14% of women and 61.47% of men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The statistically significant incidence was observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> 55.99% women and 74.51% men and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> respectively in 22.81% and 51.16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar differences took place in specific types of gastroesophageal disease, especially endoscopic features characteristic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were observed nine times more frequently in men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Types with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> were observed twice as much in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> of both sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Esophagus mucosae cloudiness was observed three times more frequently in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> and 50% more frequently in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the data suggests there is a significant coincidence between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">esophageal reflux disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
