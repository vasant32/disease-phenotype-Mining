<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is characterized by the transition of squamous epithelium into columnar epithelium with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increased number and types of immune cells in BE have been indicated to be due to a Th2-type inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the alternative hypothesis that the abundance of T-cells in BE is caused by a homing mechanism that is found in the duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Biopsies from BE and duodenal tissue from 30 BE patients and duodenal tissue from 18 controls were characterized by immmunohistochemistry for the presence of T-cells and eosinophils(eos) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo expanded T-cells were further phenotyped by multicolor analysis using flowcytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The high percentage of CD4(+)-T cells (69±3% (mean±<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>/n = 17, by flowcytometry)), measured by flowcytometry and immunohistochemistry, and the presence of non-activated eosinophils found in BE by immunohistochemical staining, were not different from that found in duodenal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expanded lymphocytes from these tissues had a similar phenotype, characterized by a comparable but low percentage of αE(CD103) positive CD4(+)cells (44±5% in BE, 43±4% in duodenum of BE and 34±7% in duodenum of controls) and a similar percentage of granzyme-B(+)CD8(+) cells(44±5% in BE, 33±6% in duodenum of BE and 36±7% in duodenum of controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a similar percentage of α4β7(+) T-lymphocytes (63±5% in BE, 58±5% in duodenum of BE and 62±8% in duodenum of controls) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of the ligand for α4β7, MAdCAM-1, was also similar in BE and duodenal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No evidence for a Th2-response was found as almost no IL-4(+)-T-cells were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The immune cell composition (lymphocytes and eosinophils) and expression of intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule MAdCAM-1 is similar in BE and duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This supports the hypothesis that homing of lymphocytes to BE tissue is mainly caused by intestinal homing signals rather than to an active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
