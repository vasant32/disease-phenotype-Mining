<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) are frequently offered laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) to treat symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of this operation with regards to symptoms and to the evolution of the columnar-lined epithelium remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the course of 106 consecutive patients with BE who underwent LARS between 1994 and 2000, representing 14% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LARS (754) performed in our institution during that period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 106 patients agreed to clinical follow-up in 2002 at 40 months (median; range, 12-95 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three patients (50%) agreed to functional evaluation (manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring); 90 patients (85%) to thorough endoscopy, with appropriate biopsies and histologic evaluation to determine the status of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Heartburn improved in 94 (96%) of 98 and resolved in 69 patients (70%) after LARS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regurgitation improved in 58 (84%) of 69 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> improved in 27 (82%) of 33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distal esophageal acid exposure improved in 48 (91%) of 53 patients tested and returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 39 patients (74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent reoperation 2 days after fundoplication (gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, biopsy revealed BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 91 patients, BE indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 12 patients, and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four of the 90 patients with endoscopic follow-up had short-segment BE (&lt;3cm), and 36 had long-segment BE (&gt;3cm) preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, endoscopy and pathology revealed complete regression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (absence of any sign suggestive of BE) in 30 (55%) of 54 patients with short-segment BE but in 0 of 36 of those with long-segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among patients with complete regression, 89% of those tested with pH monitoring had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This was observed in 69% of those who failed to have complete regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> within 10 months of LARS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with BE, LARS provides excellent control of symptoms and esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> regressed in the majority of patients who had short-segment BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pH monitoring following LARS, a fact that was, heretofore, not appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>LARS should be recommended to patients with BE to quell symptoms and to prevent the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
