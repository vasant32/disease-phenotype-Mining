<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BEAC cells, like many other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, may reactivate telomerase to achieve unlimited proliferative potential, making telomerase a unique therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of telomerase inhibition on BEAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the effect of a selective G-quadruplex intercalating telomerase inhibitor, 2,6-bis[3-(N-Piperidino)propionamido]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35298">anthracene</z:chebi>-9,10-dione (PPA), on telomerase activity, telomere length, colony size distribution, and proliferative potential in 2 BEAC cell lines, BIC-1 and SEG-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Telomerase activity was &gt;10-fold and &gt;600-fold elevated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric/intestinal cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diploid fibroblasts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Telomeres were short, being less than 4 kilobase pair in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure to PPA effectively inhibited telomerase activity and shortened telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PPA also arrested cell proliferation and reduced colony number and size after a lag period of about 10 cell generations, consistent with the attrition of telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> was not due to senescence but was due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression analysis of the cells following PPA treatment did not show significant change in the expression of genes involved in cell-cycle proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exposure to PPA had no effect on proliferative potential of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that telomerase inhibition by PPA induces cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> in BEAC cells and demonstrate the potential of telomerase inhibitors in chemoprevention and treatment of Barrett's-associated esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
