<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether short telomere length in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chromosomes or just some of them is associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> (EC) risk is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we examined the overall and chromosome-specific telomere lengths of 17p, 12q, 2p, and 11q and assessed their associations with EC risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a case-control study with 94 EC cases and 94 matched controls, the overall telomere length and the chromosome-specific telomere lengths of 17p, 12q, 2p, and 11q in peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined by a real-time PCR and a modified single telomere length analysis assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between telomere length and EC risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, EC patients had significantly shorter overall telomere lengths (P = 0.004) and chromosome-specific telomere lengths of 17p (P = 0.003) and 12q (P = 0.006) but not of 11q (P = 0.632) and 2p (P = 0.972) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the short overall telomere length and chromosome-specific telomere lengths of 17p and 12q were associated with a dose-dependent increase in EC risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study provides the first epidemiologic evidence that short telomere length of 17p and 12q plays an important role in esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, suggesting that short telomere length of specific chromosomes is associated with the etiology of different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
