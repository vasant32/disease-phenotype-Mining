<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that DNA repair is an important contributory factor of early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, our study focused on the expression of the base excision repair enzyme N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG) in EAC disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MPG <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) expression levels were determined using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from a maximum of 72 patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was further utilized for the detection of MPG protein, and semiquantitative analysis performed using an H-score approach was carried out on a total of 130 archival tissue samples of different esophageal pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear localized MPG protein was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonmalignant tissues derived from the enterohepatic system, with H-score values of 3.9-5.5 ± 0.4-1.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cancerous tissues derived from the enterohepatic system, a 9.5-fold increase in the level of MPG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was specifically observed in the malignant regions located within the esophagus region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis revealed a 9- and 14-fold increase in MPG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in EAC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, node, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> stages II and III, respectively, suggesting MPG expression to correlate with EAC disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry analysis further showed a sevenfold significant increase in MPG protein expression in EAC tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, there was a fivefold significant decrease in nuclear localized MPG protein expression in tissues derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such findings highlight a complex regulatory pattern governing DNA glycosylase base excision repair initiation, as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue undergoes Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and later dedifferentiates to EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Indeed, disease-stage-specific alterations in the expression of MPG may highlight a potential role for MPG in determining EAC <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and thus potentially be of clinical relevance for early disease detection and increased patient survival </plain></SENT>
