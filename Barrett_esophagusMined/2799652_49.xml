<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a common finding in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and is associated with a high incidence of serious complications (stricture, ulceration, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reason that only a portion of patients with reflux develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and why some are prone to develop complications is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent endoscopy, 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, and manometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine of these patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> underwent 24-hour gastric pH monitoring, and three with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> underwent 99mTc-labeled hepato-iminodiacetic acid scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with complicated (n = 12) and uncomplicated (n = 11) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were compared with each other and with patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n = 53) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> showed an increased exposure to acid and alkaline gastric juice compared with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with and without complications, there was no significant difference in age, incidence of defective lower esophageal sphincter, incidence of defective peristalsis, extent of the Barrett's epithelium, or percent time the esophageal pH was less than 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the percent time the esophageal pH was greater than 7 was significantly greater in patients with complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This alkaline exposure is likely to be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was supported by positive gastric pH scores for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> and 99mTc-labeled hepato-iminodiacetic acid scans in patients with Barrett's complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the development of complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is the result of the damaging effect of refluxed duodenal juice </plain></SENT>
