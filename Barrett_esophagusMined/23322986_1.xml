<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the current standard of care for esophageal pathology involves resection of the affected tissue, sometimes involving radical esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Without exception, these procedures are associated with a high morbidity, compromised quality of life, and unacceptable mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regenerative medicine approaches to functional tissue replacement include the use of biological and synthetic scaffolds to promote tissue remodeling and growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the case of esophageal repair, extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds have proven to be effective for the reconstruction of small patch defects, anastomosis reinforcement, and the prevention of stricture formation after endomucosal resection (EMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More so, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> patients treated with ECM scaffolds have shown complete restoration of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, functional, and disease-free epithelium after EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies provide evidence that a regenerative medicine approach may enable aggressive resection of neoplastic tissue without the need for radical esophagectomy and its associated complications </plain></SENT>
