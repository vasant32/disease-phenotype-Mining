<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is traditionally thought of as a disease of middle-aged Caucasian men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about BE in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to assess the effect of age on features of BE including the prevalence and incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients enrolled into the Cleveland Clinic BE registry from 1979 to 2002 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, ethnicity, number of endoscopies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> size, length of Barrett's segment, prevalence and incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were compared between patients &gt; or = 50 yr old and &lt; 50 yr old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 837 patients in the registry (638 &gt; or = 50 yr, 199 &lt; 50 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> size was larger in patients &gt; or = 50 yr than in those &lt; 50 yr (median 4.0 cm, interquartile range 2.0-5.0 cm vs 3.0, 2.0-4.0 cm; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, there were no significant differences among other features in the patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 225 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (195 &gt; or = 50 yr and 30 &lt; 50 yr; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of this group, 176 were prevalent cases (159 &gt; or = 50 yr and 17 &lt; 50 yr) and 49 were incident cases (36 &gt; or = 50 yr and 13 &lt; 50 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The odds of those &gt; or = 50 yr being a prevalent case of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was five times the odds of those &lt; 50 yr (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was similar in both age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports emerging data that approximately 25% of BE patients are less than 50 yr of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>While older patients had a higher prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is similar in both age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future screening strategies for BE should recognize these important findings </plain></SENT>
