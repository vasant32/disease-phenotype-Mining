<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Previously diagnosed GIM patients underwent targeted biopsy from areas with and without GIM, as indicated by NBI, twice at an interval of 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors compared the endoscopic criteria such as light blue crest (LBC), villous pattern (VP), and large long crest (LLC) with standard histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results from two surveillance endoscopies were compared with histology results for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratio of positive test (LR+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> cases detected was also reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NBI targeted biopsy was performed in 38 and 26 patients during the first and second surveillance endoscopies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 2 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> detected in the first endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was detected from the second study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical and endoscopic resections were successfully performed in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, NPV, and LR+ of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 endoscopic criteria during the first/second surveillance were 78.8%/91.3%, 82.5%/89.1%, 72.8%/77.8%, 86.8%/96.1, and 4.51/8.4, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LBC provided the highest LR+ over VP and LLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-sequential NBI is useful for GIM targeted biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LBC provides the most sensitive reading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the optimal duration between two surveillance requires further study </plain></SENT>
