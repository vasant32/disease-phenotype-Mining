<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By detecting reflux episodes independently of their acidity, multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (MII-pH) monitoring allows a comprehensive characterization of reflux events, either off or on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess reflux parameters by MII-pH monitoring in newly diagnosed SSBO, at baseline and as modified with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Short-segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was defined by oesophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> up to 3 cm in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>24-h MII-pH monitoring was performed before and during <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty patients were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> OAET was found at baseline in 15 patients (30%), 8 and 2 of whom with a higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> number of acid and weakly acidic refluxes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, abnormal reflux parameters were detected by MII-pH monitoring in 90% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reflux events were prevalent in the upright period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy, acid refluxes decreased and a correspondent increase in weakly acidic refluxes was observed (median from 48.5 to 9 and from 16 to 57.5, respectively) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Acid refluxes, mainly in the upright period, characterize SSBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy transforms acid refluxes into weakly acidic refluxes </plain></SENT>
