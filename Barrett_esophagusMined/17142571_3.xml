<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This showed a possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcer</z:hpo>, although histological examination was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up endoscopy showed white ridges in the distal duodenum and these were subjected to biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the biopsy specimens showed polypoid duodenal mucosa showing features similar to those of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyp</z:mpath> of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mucosal surface was focally of gastric surface type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The features were interpreted overall as most likely to represent an unusual form of regenerative change in the setting of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory mucosal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The case is presented as an unusual histological phenomenon at this site; it would be important not to overdiagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in this situation </plain></SENT>
