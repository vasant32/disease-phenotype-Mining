<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further understand the mechanisms of acid- and bile-induced hyperproliferation in BE, we investigated the release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) in response to acid or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsies of esophagus, BE, and duodenum were exposed to a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> mixture as a 1-h pulse and compared with exposure to pH 7.4 for up to 24 h, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) release, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and protein kinase C (PKC) expression were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar experiments were also performed with acidified media (pH 3.5) alone, in the presence or absence of bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), a selective PKC inhibitor, and NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-hour pulses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> or acid significantly enhanced proliferation, COX-2 expression, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) release in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the combination pulse of acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> had no such effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with either BIM or NS-398 led to a dramatic decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) release in BE explants and a suppression of proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The acid- or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi>-mediated hyperproliferation is related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Acid- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi>-induced induction of COX-2 and PKC may explain, at least in part, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-promoting effects of acid and bile in BE </plain></SENT>
