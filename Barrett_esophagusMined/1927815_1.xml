<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of these patients before this complication develops is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively made the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> on routine biphasic upper gastrointestinal series in nine patients in whom a mucosal surface pattern alteration was the only radiologic abnormality on the esophagogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy in eight patients and during surgery in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only a third of the patients had symptoms related to the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two types of surface changes were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A reticular pattern was present in six cases and a villous pattern in five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patterns were noted in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This series was obtained in a 5-year interval during which there were 15 additional patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and corresponding esophagograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of these patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results on esophagograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recognition of these subtle surface patterns, particularly in the absence of other reflux-induced abnormalities, may improve detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and aid in the selection of patients for subsequent surveillance </plain></SENT>
