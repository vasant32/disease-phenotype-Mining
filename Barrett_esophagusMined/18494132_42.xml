<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Visible abnormalities were removed with endoscopic resection prior to ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Persistence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and absence of IMC were confirmed with biopsy after endoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A balloon-based electrode was used for primary circumferential ablation and an endoscope-mounted electrode was used for secondary focal ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (nine men; median age 70 years) were treated (median Barrett's length 7 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visible abnormalities were removed by endoscopic resection in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The worst pathological grade of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> after resection and prior to ablation was low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) (n = 1) and HGD (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a median of one circumferential and two focal ablation sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete remission of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was achieved in 12/12 patients (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete endoscopic and histological removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was achieved in 12/12 patients (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no ablation-related stenoses, and no subsquamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was observed in 363 biopsies obtained from post-ablation neo-squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Protocolized cleaning of the ablation zone and electrode in between ablations resulted in superior regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> compared with previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 14 months no recurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stepwise circumferential and focal ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with flat HGD or for Barrett's with residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> after endoscopic resection for HGD/IMC is a safe and effective treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Its success rate and safety profile compare favorably with alternatives such as esophagectomy, widespread endoscopic resection or photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
