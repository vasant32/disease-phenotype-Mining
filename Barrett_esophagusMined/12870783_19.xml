<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) versus surgical esophagectomy and intensive endoscopic surveillance for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) who are operative candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of our Markov Monte Carlo model show that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> increased life expectancy by 1.8 years and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) by 1.65 years when compared to the surveillance strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative to the esophagectomy strategy, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> resulted in a greater life expectancy by 0.8 years and 2.17 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> cost 20,400 dollars and 7,100 dollars more than surveillance and esophagectomy respectively, the resulting incremental cost-effective ratios (ICERs) of 12,400 dollars/QALY and 3,300 dollars/QALY are within commonly accepted values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were sensitive to the value assigned to the quality of life after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, but only at unrealistic values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> increases life expectancy and is cost-effective when compared to endoscopic surveillance and surgical esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
