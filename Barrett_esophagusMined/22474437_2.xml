<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the past, detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of esophagus had been dependent on biopsies taken during standard white-light endoscopy (WLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently high-resolution (HR) endoscopy enables us to visualize esophageal mucosa but resolution for glandular structures and cells is still low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) is a new promising diagnostic technique by which details of glandular and vascular structures of mucosal layer can be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical utility of this new diagnostic tool has not yet been fully explored in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this paper we will highlight this new technique for detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0000467'>esophageal dysplasia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> from a clinical practice perspective </plain></SENT>
