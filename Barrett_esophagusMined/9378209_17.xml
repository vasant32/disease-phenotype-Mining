<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Magnification endoscopy and chromoendoscopy together have been used to evaluate mucosal detail in a number of conditions, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and flat <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp>, but they have not been used to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011473'>villous atrophy</z:hpo> in the proximal small intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four patients suspected of having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> syndrome (either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tropical sprue</z:e>) were evaluated using an Olympus magnification gastroscope in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and high magnification settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indigo carmine dye spraying techniques were used to assist in evaluating duodenal mucosa for evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011473'>villous atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of endoscopically predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011473'>villous atrophy</z:hpo> was assessed by histologic evaluation of biopsy specimens taken in the descending duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Magnification endoscopy with dye spraying was both highly sensitive (94%) and specific (88%) in identifying patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011473'>villous atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This technique was more accurate (91%) in identifying patients with partial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> than standard endoscopy (9%, p &lt; 0.01) and was also useful in identifying patients with patchy <z:hpo ids='HP_0011473'>villous atrophy</z:hpo> (5 of 5) to allow directed biopsies of abnormal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Magnification endoscopy with chromoendoscopy is a promising technique for the evaluation of patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technique is especially valuable in patients with partial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, where villous abnormalities can be patchy and the duodenum usually appears <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> during standard endoscopy </plain></SENT>
