<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Making the correct diagnosis is difficult and there is no agreement on the treatment for this rare condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 56-year-old man who presented with features of repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149725" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="LRTI">chest infections</z:e> six years following an esophagectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive investigations the cause of symptoms was difficult to determine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correct diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> from stomach to right main stem bronchus was made at bronchoscopy under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After ruling out local recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, a successful primary repair was carried out by resection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> and direct repair of gastric conduit and bronchus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He is well after 6 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Late development of gastro-bronchial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> is a rare complication of esophageal resection that may be difficult to diagnose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection and direct closure is the treatment of choice, although the method of treatment should be tailored according to the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> and the patient's condition </plain></SENT>
