<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Complete Barrett's eradication endoscopic mucosal resection (CBE-EMR) is the endoscopic removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Barrett's epithelium with the curative intent of eliminating high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD)/intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IMC) and reducing the risk of metachronous lesion development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our single tertiary referral center's long-term clinical experience using this modality in HGD/IMC management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had CBE-EMR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) with HGD/IMC who had been entered into our center's prospectively collected database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-definition white-light and narrow-band imaging examinations were used according to the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Staging endoscopic ultrasound was done before CBE-EMR to exclude invasive disease or suspicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-dose proton pump inhibition was instituted after initial treatment, and Seattle-type surveillance biopsies were performed on follow-up every 6 months once the CBE-EMR procedure was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 49 patients (mean age 67 years, median 65, s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>11; 75% men) with histologically confirmed BE and HGD (33), IMC (16), underwent CBE-EMR from August 2003 to August 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean BE segment length was 3.2 cm (median 2, s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2.2); 26 patients had short-segment BE, and 30 had visible lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 106 EMR procedures were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On initial EMR, two patients had superficial submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> invasion (sm1) and two had IMC with lymphatic channel invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients were referred for esophagectomy, but one opted for continued endoscopic management, without evidence of residual or recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A total of 14 patients await completion of EMR (9) or first follow-up endoscopy (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CBE-EMR therapy was completed in 32 patients by an average of 2.1 sessions (median 2, s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Surveillance biopsies showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium in 31 of 32 (96.9%) patients (mean remission time 22.9 months, median 17, s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>16.7, interquartile range 11-38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 10 of 46 patients who continued in the endoscopic protocol had subsquamous Barrett's epithelium on EMR specimens and/or treatment endoscopy biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Overall, 1 of these 10 patients had Barrett's underneath squamous mucosa on most recent surveillance biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CBE-EMR upstaged pre-EMR pathology results in 7 of 49 (14%) of patients and downstaged pathology in 15 of 49 (31%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 18 of 49 (37%) patients developed symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo> after a mean of 24.4 days (median 13.5, s.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>27.8); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were successfully managed by endoscopic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> or uncontrollable <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest American single-center experience demonstrating that CBE-EMR with close endoscopic surveillance is an effective treatment modality for BE with HGD/IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Although the rate of stenosis development is significant, it is easily treated by endoscopic dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Patients considering endoscopic ablation should be counseled appropriately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The role of CBE-EMR in patients with lymphatic invasion or superficial submucosal invasion remains to be defined </plain></SENT>
