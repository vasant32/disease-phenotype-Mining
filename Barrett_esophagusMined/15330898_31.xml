<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Prospective evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in order to determine what demographic, endoscopic, and histologic features are predictive of the prevalence and incidence of Barrett's high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (Ca) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Newly diagnosed BE patients were entered into and followed in a standardized surveillance protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following features were examined using either forward, stepwise multiple regression analysis, or Cox proportional hazards to determine their ability to predict the presence of HGD or Ca at index BE diagnosis as well as their ability to predict progression of BE during follow-up: age, race, gender, length of BE in cm, size of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at index diagnosis as well as during surveillance, gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> status, and type of medical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid-reflux</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 550 patients were diagnosed with BE over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed three factors significantly associated with index diagnosis of HGD or Ca: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (larger size), Barrett's length (longer length), and absence of H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and twenty-four BE entered the surveillance protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models revealed a significant and independent association for five factors predictive of the time to progression of BE: presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at index diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001), severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> during surveillance (p &lt; 0.001), length of Barrett's epithelium (p= 0.012), size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (p= 0.006), and gastric H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> status (p= 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic and histologic features of BE at initial diagnosis are predictive of index HGD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> as well as with risk of BE progression </plain></SENT>
