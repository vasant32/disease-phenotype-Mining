<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, indication for endoscopy, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> treatment affects the subsequent incidence of BE diagnosis in patients found to have EE on EGD performed for any indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We identified patients with primary or secondary International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision diagnosis codes of EE from 1996 to 2006 who had at least 2 EGDs on record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with prevalent BE on the first EGD were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Inpatients and outpatients at Stanford University and Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Health Care System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Retrospective review of EGD and pathology reports to confirm BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Detection of BE after diagnosis of EE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1095 patients were identified between 1996 and 2000, and 102 (9%) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two (61%) patients were veterans, 87 (85%) were male, and 83 (81%) were white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/-SD) age was 58 +/- 14 years (range 24-83 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BE was detected in 9 (9%) patients (95% CI, 4.5%-17.6%) over a mean of 13.3 +/- 5.7 months (range 1-53.5 months), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had prior grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean BE length was 4 +/- 1.8 cm (range 1-18 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six patients had upper GI <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> as the indication for EGD, whereas the other 3 complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The association of grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (P = .01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>GI hemorrhage</z:hpo> (P = .01) to the subsequent detection of BE was highly statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study, small number of patients with BE after EE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were receiving care at tertiary medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BE was detected in 9% of patients with prior EE and was detected exclusively on follow-up of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients found to have BE had upper GI <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> as the presentation for EGD </plain></SENT>
