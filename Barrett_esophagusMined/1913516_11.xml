<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the early events of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development in the columnar cell-lined lower esophagus, 13 esophagectomy specimens with early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (T1) were histopathologically studied and the morphometry of the lesion was performed on a histologic map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven (84.6%) of the 13 early Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were contiguous to both the distinctive specialized-type Barrett's mucosa and squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ten (76.9%) of the 13 tumors had residual squamous islands on the surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> mostly develop at a place very close to the squamocolumnar epithelial border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distance from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> center to the nearest squamous epithelium, including squamous islands, was 2 cm or less in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases but one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors conclude that the primary site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is the metaplastic columnar-lined area, particularly of specialized type, within 2 cm from the squamocolumnar epithelial border </plain></SENT>
