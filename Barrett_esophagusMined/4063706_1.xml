<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was associated with an adjacent stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The low incidence of this radiological finding emphasises that Barrett oesophagus is a histological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients had only the non-specific and common radiological findings of reflux with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> and one patient had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> examination </plain></SENT>
