<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has been increasing in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE have 30- to 125-fold increased risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New techniques allowing early diagnosis, in addition to the identification of markers capable of predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors discuss the diagnostic features of BE and BE-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE can exhibit different types of metaplastic mucosa, but only the specialized (intestinal) mucosa has the potential to progress to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The problems associated with diagnosing BE and with predicting the behavior of this condition are outlined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Studies are underway to identify molecular markers capable of predicting which BE patient will progress to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brush cytology and flow cytometry may become useful tools in the early detection of this disease </plain></SENT>
