<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that increased 4N (G2/tetraploid) populations predict progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and that the development of 4N abnormalities is interdependent with inactivation of the p53 gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
