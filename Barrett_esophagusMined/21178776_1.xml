<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HH may increase with age as a result of fibromuscular degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> increases intra-abdominal pressure and may increase the risk of HH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was undertaken to assess the influence of risk factors for HH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies that included HH and potential aetiological factors (e.g. age, sex and BMI) as keywords were extracted from Medline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies and were required to define HH endoscopically and include unselected study populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data on a number of HH in relation to aetiological factors were extracted and a meta-analysis was performed, provided at least two suitable studies for each factor were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2953 abstracts, 29 studies contained information on HH in relation to age, sex and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven studies provided data for meta-analysis of the effect of age and HH was associated with age above 50 years [odds ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35-3.51, P=0.001, I2=97.3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four studies provided data for meta-analysis of the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and HH was associated with BMI above 25 kg/m2 (odds ratio 1.93, 95% CI: 1.10-3.39, P=0.002, I2=80.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighteen studies provided data for meta-analysis of the effect of sex and HH was more common among men (odds ratio 1.36, 95% CI: 1.10-1.68, P=0.005, I2=89.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Publication bias was assessed by the Classic fail-safe N test and no significant evidence of publication bias was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HH increases with age and increasing BMI and HH is more common among men </plain></SENT>
