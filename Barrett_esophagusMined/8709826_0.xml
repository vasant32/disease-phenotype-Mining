<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first therapeutic experiences with the conventional photosensitizer dihematopor-phyrineter in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without or with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus demonstrate the efficacy and the curative potential of photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The unwanted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000992'>skin photosensitivity</z:hpo> and only relative selectivity of the haematoporphyrins however, are somehow unsatisfactory and therefore, an optimization of the method of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The endogenous photosensitizer aminolaevulinic acid with its high mucosa specificity without phototoxic side effects of the skin which can be administered orally was successfully used by our group for the treatment of patients with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
