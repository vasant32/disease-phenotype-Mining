<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fluorescence spectra at 11 excitation wavelengths and a reflectance spectrum were acquired in approximately 1 second from each site before biopsy using an optical fiber probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The measured fluorescence spectra were combined with the reflectance spectra to extract the intrinsic tissue fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reflectance spectra provided morphologic information about the bulk tissue, whereas light-scattering spectroscopy was used to determine cell nuclear crowding and enlargement in Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between dysplastic and nondysplastic BE in terms of intrinsic fluorescence, bulk scattering properties, and levels of epithelial cell nuclear crowding and enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 techniques resulted in superior sensitivity and specificity for separating high-grade from non-high-grade and dysplastic from nondysplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intrinsic fluorescence, reflectance, and light-scattering spectroscopies provide complementary information about biochemical and morphologic changes that occur during the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of these techniques (Tri-Modal Spectroscopy) can serve as an excellent tool for the evaluation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE </plain></SENT>
