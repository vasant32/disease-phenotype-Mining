<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In Japan and countries such as South Korea and Taiwan, China, the standard technique for detecting early <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e>) is chromoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique involves a magnified endoscope and the use of an indigo-carmine spray to distinguish between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this technique is not widely adopted in many parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One important reason for limited use is that this technique needs an experienced endoscopist to interpret the images during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the sensitivity for detecting gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (GIM), a precancerous lesion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e>, is graded as suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the requirement of a cumbersome spraying method is inconvenient and needs preparation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Easier digital chromoendoscopy techniques, such as Narrow-band Imaging and Flexible spectral Imaging Color Enhancement, have been reported to facilitate targeted GIM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They provide higher sensitivities over conventional white light endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recently, the novel technology of confocal laser endomicroscopy has been introduced as a high-magnification (1000 Ã—) real-time evaluation for many early gastrointestinal (GI) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and precancerous GI lesions, including colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and GIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The advantage of this technique is that it can be used as an in vivo confirmation of the presence of GIM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> during endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This review aims to explain the current information on the usefulness of digital chromoendoscopy and confocal laser endomicroscopy for evaluating GIM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e> during endoscopic surveillance and the possible future role of these techniques for GI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening programs </plain></SENT>
