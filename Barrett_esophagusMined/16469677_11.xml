<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Frozen sections help to give immediate feedback for surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has not been determined whether EMR can be adequately interpreted by using frozen sections to aid endoscopists in completely resecting neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EMR specimens from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were tested by frozen section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathologists evaluated EMR specimens for the depth of invasion as well as the appearance of clear margins of resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The kappa statistic was calculated to assess the degree of agreement between the frozen section and permanent section diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three consecutive patients underwent 30 EMRs with frozen section diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frozen section revealed a <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 7 specimens (23%) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 20 (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Permanent sections found <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 8 specimens (26%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 19 specimens (63%), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in the remainder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The kappa statistic for the depth of invasion of EMR specimens was 0.93 (near perfect agreement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The kappa statistic for the margins of the EMR specimens was 0.80 (excellent agreement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that frozen section analysis of esophageal EMR specimens is valid as compared with permanent section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This technique might allow rapid evaluation about the degree and depth of involvement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This allows physicians to make decisions regarding further therapy if margins are involved or decrease the use of EMR for histologically benign-appearing lesions </plain></SENT>
