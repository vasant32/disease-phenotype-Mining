<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adherence to practice guidelines for endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is equivocal with evidence of underutilization and overutilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While physicians report strong agreement with and adherence to recommended surveillance endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD]) guidelines, less is known about modifiable barriers and facilitators shaping patients' adherence behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to conduct a structured literature review of studies exploring patients' perspectives regarding surveillance EGD and to place these results within a conceptual framework </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A structured literature review of PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases with qualitative thematic analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six studies met eligibility criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of results identified five distinct themes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>First, patients' objective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk estimates are consistent with subjective risk perceptions, but neither is associated with EGD surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Second, patients have strong beliefs in the benefits of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening and surveillance and trust in their doctors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Third, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptoms are related to risk perceptions and outcome expectancies of surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourth, endoscopic surveillance itself has affective and physical consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, health services and system variables are related to risk perception and EGD surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These themes coherently fit within an integrated model of intuitive decision-making and health behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Studies meeting eligibility criteria were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in terms of their study objectives and findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Quantitative meta-analyses of study findings could not be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To improve adherence, endoscopic surveillance programs should consider how patients intuitively frame risks and benefits and patients' emotional reactions to the endoscopy procedure, and focus on how physicians communicate recommendations </plain></SENT>
