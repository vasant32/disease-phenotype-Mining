<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO), squamous epithelium is replaced by specialised intestinal epithelium (SIE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcription factors associated with intestinal differentiation, such as CDX2, may be involved in BO development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate CDX2 expression in BO, squamous epithelium, and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CDX2 expression was assessed in 245 samples-167 biopsies of the columnar lined segment and 38 squamous epithelial biopsies of 39 patients with histologically confirmed BO (10 with <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty biopsies from 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e> (RO) without BO were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CDX2 protein was investigated immunohistochemically in 138 biopsies from 16 patients with BO, four with <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, and 20 with RO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cdx2 and Muc2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were detected semiquantitatively using 88 BO biopsies and squamous epithelium from 19 BO patients, and when present from <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SIE was present in 53/79 biopsies from the columnar lined segment; CDX2 protein was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> epithelial cells, but not in biopsies containing only gastric metaplastic epithelium (26/79), or in squamous epithelium (0/40) of patients with RO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cdx2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsies with goblet cell specific Muc2 transcription-indicative of SIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low Cdx2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was seen in 6/19 squamous epithelium samples taken 5 cm above the squamocolumnar junction of BO patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CDX2 protein/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is strongly associated with oesophageal SIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cdx2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was present in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing squamous epithelium of one third of BO patients, and may precede morphological changes seen in BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, pathways that induce Cdx2 transcription in squamous epithelial cells may be important in BO development </plain></SENT>
