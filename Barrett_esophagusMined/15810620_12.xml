<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the role of Cdx2 in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, we have shown a sequence of morphological changes of squamous epithelium leading to BE, found a peculiar metaplastic change common to other parts of gut, and proposed the concept of a "gut regenerative cell lineage" (GRCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GRCL is characterized by pyloric-foveolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath>, which occurs in the regenerative process in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BE very likely develops through the GRCL, and we studied the expression of Cdx2 in various lesions of rat esophageal mucosa induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e>, using reverse transciptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry against Cdx2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that Cdx2 was expressed not only in specialized columnar epithelium (SCE) of BE, but also in several pyloric gland and foveolar metaplastic cells which developed in the basal layer of the squamous epithelium at an earlier stage of SCE development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that Cdx2 plays a crucial role in directing intestinal-type differentiation of the GRCL </plain></SENT>
