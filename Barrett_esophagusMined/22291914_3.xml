<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) is a rarely curable disease and is rapidly rising worldwide in incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Barret's esophagus (BE) and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) are considered major risk factors for invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, unbiased global metabolic profiling methods were applied to serum samples from patients with EAC, BE and HGD, and healthy individuals, in order to identify metabolite based biomarkers associated with the early stages of EAC with the goal of improving prognostication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Serum metabolite profiles from patients with EAC (n = 67), BE (n = 3), HGD (n = 9) and healthy volunteers (n = 34) were obtained using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve metabolites differed significantly (p&lt;0.05) between EAC patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A partial least-squares discriminant analysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) model had good accuracy with the area under the receiver operative characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when the results of LC-MS were combined with 8 metabolites detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in a previous study, the combination of NMR and MS detected metabolites provided a much superior performance, with AUROC = 0.95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, mean values of 12 of these metabolites varied consistently from healthy controls to the high-risk individuals (BE and HGD patients) and EAC subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altered metabolic pathways including a number of amino acid pathways and energy metabolism were identified based on altered levels of numerous metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Metabolic profiles derived from the combination of LC-MS and NMR methods readily distinguish EAC patients and potentially promise important routes to understanding the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and detecting the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences in the metabolic profiles between high-risk individuals and the EAC indicate the possibility of identifying the patients at risk much earlier to the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
