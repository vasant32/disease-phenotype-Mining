<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new device for endoscopic monopolar electrocoagulation and to develop ablative techniques by using this new device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The new device consists of an overtube with a wire mesh electrode in an oval opening in the distal end and a balloon at the distal end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-frequency electrical current was applied in 5 animal (swine) esophagi by using this specially designed monopolar electrocoagulation device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 "lesions" were ablated by using blend electrosurgical waveforms for different time durations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The esophagi were then resected for histopathologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histopathologic study of the ablated lesions demonstrated that, by using the monopolar electrocoagulation device, different levels of degeneration of the mucosa and submucosa were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The method for use of the device is fast and easy to apply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ablative procedure with the new overtube device is minimally invasive, clearly feasible, and easy to apply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This new device potentially can be used in patients for tissue ablation </plain></SENT>
