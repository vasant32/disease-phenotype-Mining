<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Factors associated with the risk of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> remain unclear, and the impact of therapy on this risk remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess patients followed long-term after anti-reflux surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with Barrett's who underwent anti-reflux surgery from 1989 to 2009 and had ≥5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 303 patients and 75 had follow-up ≥5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up time for the 75 patients was 8.9 years (range 5-18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regression was seen in 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progression occurred in 8%, and these patients were significantly more likely to have a failed fundoplication (67% vs. 16%, p = 0.0129) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of progression from non-dysplastic Barrett's to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was 0.8% per patient year, and was seven times higher in patients with a failed fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared to the accepted rate of progression of non-dysplastic Barrett's to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of 1.0% per patient year, anti-reflux surgery reduces this rate during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of progression was significantly lower in patients with an intact compared to a disrupted fundoplication, further suggesting that anti-reflux surgery can alter the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
