<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Caveolin-1 (Cav1), a scaffold protein of membrane caveolae, is transcriptionally regulated by cholesterol via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi>-responsive element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cav1 protects squamous epithelia by controlling cell growth and stabilizing cell junctions and matrix <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cav1 is frequently down-regulated in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>; however, the molecular mechanisms that lead to this event are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that the basal layer of the nonneoplastic human esophageal squamous epithelium expressed Cav1 mainly at intercellular junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Cav1 was lost in 95% of tissue specimens from BAC patients (n = 100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A strong cytoplasmic expression of Cav1 correlated with poor survival in a small subgroup (n = 5) of BAC patients, and stable expression of an oncogenic Cav1 variant (Cav1-P132L) in the human BAC cell line OE19 promoted proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cav1 was also detectable in immortalized human squamous epithelial, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (CPC), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> cells (OE21), but was low in BAC cell lines (OE19, OE33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> down-regulated Cav1 expression by inhibition of the proteolytic cleavage of 125-kDa pre-SREBP1 from the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus and nuclear translocation of active 68-kDa SREBP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This block in SREBP1's posttranslational processing impaired transcriptional activation of SREBP1 response elements in the proximal human Cav1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cav1 was also down-regulated in esophagi from C57BL/6 mice on a diet enriched with 1% (wt/wt) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">chenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mice deficient for Cav1 or the nuclear <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> receptor farnesoid X receptor showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000962'>hyperkeratosis</z:hpo> of the basal cell layer of esophageal epithelia, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>-mediated down-regulation of Cav1 marks early changes in the squamous epithelium, which may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and progression to BAC </plain></SENT>
