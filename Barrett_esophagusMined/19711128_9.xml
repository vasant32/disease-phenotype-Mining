<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (ERFA) is being evaluated as definitive treatment for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Guidelines have yet to be developed for the application of this technology to patients with ultralong-segment BE (ULBE, &gt; or = 8 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study reports a single institution's experience with ERFA of ULBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with ULBE undergoing ERFA from August 2005 to February 2009 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The entire segment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) was treated at each session using balloon- and/or plate-based devices (BARRX Medical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retreatments, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), dilations, and biopsies were performed based on endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surveillance was conducted according to standard guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (22 male) with a median age of 66 years [interquartile range (IQR) 57-74 years] were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The length of BE treated was 10 cm (median; IQR 8-12 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IMC) was present in 3 patients, 15 had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), 6 had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), and 1 had IM without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 25 patients included <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (n = 1), stricture (n = 2), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Time from the initial procedure was such that 15 patients had postablation biopsies at least once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient with biopsies elected to undergo esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 78.5% (11/14) had complete response (CR; no residual IM), two patients regressed from HGD to IM, and one patient with IMC had residual HGD and was treated with repeat EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The number of ablations in this group was 2.5 (median, IQR 2-3) during a median follow-up time of 20.3 months (IQR 10.4-29.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ERFA is safe and feasible in patients with ULBE and can be applied to the entire length of IM during one session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Eradication of BE can be achieved with few repeat ablations and continued, vigilant surveillance </plain></SENT>
