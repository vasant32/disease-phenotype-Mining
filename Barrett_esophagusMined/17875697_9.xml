<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In non-neoplastic Barrett's epithelial (BAR-T) cells, in contrast, we have shown that acid exposure has antiproliferative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore our hypothesis that the acid-induced, antiproliferative effects are mediated by alterations in the proteins that regulate the G(1)-S cell cycle checkpoint, we exposed non-neoplastic Barrett's cells to acidic media (pH 4.0) and analyzed G(1)-S checkpoint proteins' expression, phosphorylation, and activity levels by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied acid effects on growth (by cell counts), proliferation (by flow cytometry and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation), cell viability (by trypan blue staining), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (by annexin V staining), and we used <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> and small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> to assess the effects of checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) inhibition on G(1)-S progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acid exposure significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0000329'>decreased cell numbers</z:mp> without affecting cell viability and with only a slight increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within 2 h of acid exposure, there was a delay in progression through the G(1)-S checkpoint that was associated with increased phosphorylation of Chk2, decreased levels of Cdc25A, and decreased activity of cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase 2; by 4 h, a continued delay at G(1)-S was associated with increased expression of p53 and p21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">Caffeine</z:chebi> and Chk2 siRNA abolished the acid-induced G(1)-S delay at 2 but not at 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that acid exposure in non-neoplastic BAR-T cells causes early antiproliferative effects that are mediated by the activation of Chk2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have elucidated a mechanism whereby acid can exert disparate effects on proliferation in neoplastic and non-neoplastic BAR-T cells </plain></SENT>
