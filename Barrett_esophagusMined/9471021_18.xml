<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have assessed long-term disease progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> patients and fewer still have considered disease progression in the significant proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (GORD) patients who do not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to reassess GORD patients 3 to 4 years after initial diagnosis and determine whether or not disease progression had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective follow-up of 101 GORD patients at least 32 months after initial assessment with oesophageal pH monitoring and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were invited to complete a symptomatic questionnaire and undergo repeat investigation with the same techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-seven (76%) patients responded (mean follow-up period 39 months, range 32-54 months) of whom 28 initially had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> (group A), 17 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endoscopy but abnormal pH monitoring (group B) and 32 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> investigations but typical reflux symptoms (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of follow-up, 57 (74%) patients either had frequent heartburn or were taking daily acid suppression therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two (68%) responders had at least one repeat investigation: 44 (57%) had repeat pH monitoring; 43 (56%) had repeat endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three (11% of the 28 responders) group A patients had developed Barrett's mucosa, 4 (24% of responders) group B patients had developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> and 10 (31% of responders) group C patients had developed abnormal pH monitoring (4), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> (4) or both (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Three-quarters of GORD patients still have troublesome symptoms at least 3 years after diagnosis and a significant proportion show endoscopic progression of the condition's severity </plain></SENT>
