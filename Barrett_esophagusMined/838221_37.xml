<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathological and clinical findings in 17 such patients are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each patient the anastomosis had been performed between histologically documented squamous-lined esophagus and gastric fundus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac type mucosa had regenerated in the region of the anastomosis in 9 patients and was detected as early as 2 months after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 3 patients, 2 of whom had cardiac type mucosa, had acquired Barrett or Barrett-like mucosa on the distal esophagus by 76 to 119 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> was prominent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings strongly support the hypothesis that the distinctive mucosa of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> develops after reflux-induced ulceration and subsequent mucosal regeneration by immature cells that are derived from cardiac and/or fundic mucosa, and which undergo specialized differentiation in the presence of reflux </plain></SENT>
