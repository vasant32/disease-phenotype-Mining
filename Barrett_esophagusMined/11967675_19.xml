<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In an attempt to reduce mortality from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, it has been recommended to enroll patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in endoscopic surveillance programs in order to detect malignant degeneration at an early and possibly curable stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the impact of endoscopic biopsy surveillance on outcome of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between November 1992 and June 2000, 312 patients with histologically proven esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were referred to our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven of these patients had Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 12 (12.2%) patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was discovered during endoscopic surveillance for Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> in the Barrett's group was 38.8% versus 8% (p &lt; 0.01) in non-Barrett's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the surveyed group, there were 9 (75%) early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (Tis-1/N0) versus 9 (10.6%, p &lt; 0.01) in the nonsurveyed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of 5 surveyed patients operated on for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> proved to have invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the esophagectomy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surveyed patients were alive at a median follow-up of 48 months; the median survival in the nonsurveyed group was 24 +/- 3 months (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> provides early detection of malignant degeneration and a better long-term survival than in nonsurveyed patients </plain></SENT>
