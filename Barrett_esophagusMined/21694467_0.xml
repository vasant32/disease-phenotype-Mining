<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Quantification showed a significant increase of 25% GITR positive TILs in EAC with BE (p&lt; 0.05) compared to 13% in adjacent BE, 24% in EAC without BE, 14% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>, and 1% in BE without IN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High GITR levels were not significantly associated with clinicopathologic features which may predict worse clinical outcome and had no impact on survival (p= 0.7878) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased GITR expression of peripheral blood leucocytes (PBLs) in EAC patients was shown on protein level (32%) and confirmed by RT-PCR (3.7-fold difference compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue) </plain></SENT>
