<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 14 cases peptic stenosis developed after Heller's myotomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo>, associated in 3 cases with fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients the stenosis was secondary to fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other 3 subjects presented a primary stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was attempted in every patient with no satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient died for a postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1444565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopulmonary failure</z:e> (4.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> of the esophago-jejunal anastomosis treated with enteral nutrition successfully (4.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In another subject splenectomy was performed following a iatrogenic injury (4.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Minor complications developed in 5 patients (23.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After one year from operation in 1 patient a severe stricture of esophago-jejunal anastomosis appeared; it was treated with anastomotic resection and reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 8 years one patient was submitted to a partial resection of interposed jejunal loop, that was redundant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 18 patients long term follow-up showed good results in 14 patients (78%), discrete in 2 (11%), unsatisfactory in 2 (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results show that Merendino's esophago-jejunal gastroplasty allows to achieve good results with acceptable rate of mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
