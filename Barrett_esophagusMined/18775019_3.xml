<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Although evidence suggests that aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> may reduce the risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), these drugs can also cause harmful side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine and characterize preferences for these two drugs in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Preferences data were collected from recruited BE patients using a customized questionnaire, which incorporated standard risk communication techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Summary profiles outlined the benefits and harms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and aspirin presented anonymously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both drugs were portrayed as reducing the risk of EAC and increasing the risk of GI events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) while aspirin reduced the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing patient acceptance of each drug were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred of 109 (92%) subjects completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under base case conditions, 15% stated that they would take <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and 76% aspirin (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients identified the greater risk of MI as the primary reason for their unwillingness to take <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and the lower risk of EAC for aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even in scenarios in which the benefits of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> were improved and the harms reduced, a majority continued to find it unacceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A majority of those surveyed stated that they would take aspirin but would not take <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most patients are interested in EAC chemoprevention, but the amount of protection and the side effect profile of a drug determine its acceptability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data can inform physicians regarding the tradeoffs patients are willing to consider for chemoprevention </plain></SENT>
