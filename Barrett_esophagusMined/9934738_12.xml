<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> around the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) is increasing in incidence, and is frequently associated with areas of macroscopic or microscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to define the incidence and type of metaplastic changes in the cardia and at the EGJ in symptomatic patients in whom there was no endoscopic columnar segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients attending for open-access gastroscopy had three sets of endoscopic biopsies taken at 3-cm intervals, from cardia, EGJ, and distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, Alcian blue/<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> (AB/<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>), and high-iron <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15571,23666">diamine</z:chebi>/Alcian blue (AB/HID) were used to define and characterize IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 225 patients, eight (4%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, eight (4%) had conventional long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 15 (7%) showed endoscopic short-segment Barrett's change, with no endoscopic Barrett's in 194 (86.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the latter, 34 (17.5%) had IM at the EGJ, and nine (4.6%) had IM at the cardia on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Acid mucin stains were positive at the EGJ in 135 (69.6%) and at the cardia in 75 (38.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>Metaplasia</z:mpath> at the EGJ was associated with sulphomucins (p &lt; 0.0001) and involved the surface glandular epithelium (p &lt; 0.0001) more frequently than the cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>Metaplasia</z:mpath> was not related to reflux symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>, or endoscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of those with IM detectable by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin were taking acid suppression, compared with 72.8% overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> is very common at the esophagogastric junction and gastric cardia, with marked differences in incidence and characteristics of mucin staining between the two sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The relationship of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
