<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The radiographs were randomized, masked, and then interpreted by two radiologists blinded to the endoscopic and biopsy diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Depending upon the diagnostic strategy of the radiologist, sensitivity varied from 0.36 to 0.83 and specificity from 0.56 to 1.00 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A typical receiver-operating-characteristic curve was generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Esophageal radiography is effective in identifying those patients who have stricture and ulceration as a complication beyond the epithelial transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, because of low sensitivity, it is not a satisfactory method for identifying most cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
