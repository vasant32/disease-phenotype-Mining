<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is highly controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the relationship between reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in Jordanian subjects and to examine the gastric site for H. pylori that is most strongly associated with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During endoscopy two biopsies from the cardia and another two biopsies from the antrum were taken from 100 consecutive patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE group) and from a sex- and age-matched group of 50 patients, who were referred to the endoscopy unit for evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal symptoms</z:e> and whose endoscopic findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biopsies were examined histologically for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> and H. pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Antral histological <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> were significantly more common in the RE group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Out of the 100 patients, 68 (68%) in the RE group and 26 of 50 (52%) in the control group were found to have H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of H. pylori in both antral and cardiac biopsies was significantly more frequent in patients of the RE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients in the RE group had positive H. pylori in both antral and cardiac biopsies (44%), while only 12 out of 50 patients of the control group (24%) had positive H. pylori in both biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group the prevalence of H. pylori in the antrum was similar to that of patients of the RE group (52% vs. 59%), but colonization of H. pylori in the cardia was significantly much lower than that of the RE group (24% vs. 53%; P = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increased prevalence of H. pylori colonization in the cardia is associated with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and further controlled clinical study is required to show the impact of H. pylori eradication in patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
