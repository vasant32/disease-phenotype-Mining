<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the roles of mucin histochemistry, cytokeratin 7/20 (CK7/20) immunoreactivity, clinical characteristics and endoscopy to distinguish short-segment Barrett's esophageal (SSBE) from cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CIM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: High iron <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15571,23666">diamine</z:chebi>/Alcian blue (HID/AB) mucin-histochemical staining and immunohistochemical staining were used to classify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) and to determine CK7/20 immunoreactivity pattern in SSBE and CIM, respectively, and these results were compared with endoscopical diagnosis and the positive rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) symptoms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long-segment Barrett's esophageal and IM of gastric antrum were designed as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of type III IM was significantly higher in SSBE than in CIM (63.33% vs 23.08%, P&lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CK7/20 immunoreactivity in SSBE showed mainly Barrett's pattern (76.66%), and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms in most cases which showed Barrett's pattern were positive, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e> was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the CK7/20 immunoreactivity in CIM was gastric pattern preponderantly (61.54%), but there were 23.08% cases that showed Barrett's pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases which showed gastric pattern was significantly higher than those which showed Barrett's pattern (63.83% vs 19.30%, P&lt; 0.005), whereas the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms in gastric pattern were significantly lower than that in Barrett's pattern (21.28% vs 85.96%, P&lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Distinction of SSBE from CIM should not be based on a single method; however, the combination of clinical characteristics, histology, mucin histochemistry, CK7/20 immunoreactivity, and endoscopic biopsy should be applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type III IM, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, and Barrett's CK7/20 immunoreactivity pattern may support the diagnosis of SSBE, whereas non-type III IM, positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e>, and gastric CK7/20 immunoreactivity pattern may imply CIM </plain></SENT>
