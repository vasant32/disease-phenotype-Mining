<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to identify genes or combination of genes that have the power to discriminate between premalignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and Barrett's associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, we analysed a panel of 23 genes using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR, Taqman and bioinformatic tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genes chosen were either known to be associated with Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> or were filtered from a previous cDNA microarray study on Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 98 tissues, obtained from 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE group) and 20 patients with Barrett's associated esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA group), were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Triplicate analysis for the full 23 gene of interest panel, and analysis of an internal control gene, was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples, for a total of more than 9016 single PCR reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found distinct classes of gene expression patterns in the different types of tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most informative genes clustered in six different classes and had significantly different expression levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> tissues compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) distinguished four genetically different groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus tissues from patients with BE or EA were not distinguishable from one another, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> tissues could be distinguished from <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using the most informative genes, obtained from a logistic regression analysis, we were able to completely distinguish between benign Barrett's and Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first non-array parallel <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> quantitation analysis of a panel of genes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> model of multistage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression quantitation of a panel of genes can discriminate between premalignant and malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression and LDAs can be used to further identify, from the complete panel, gene subsets with the power to make these diagnostic distinctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Expression analysis of a limited number of highly selected genes may have clinical usefulness for the treatment of patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
