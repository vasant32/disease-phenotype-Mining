<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic surveillance including stepwise four quadrant biopsies (4QB) is still regarded as the standard approach in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several methods such as dye staining with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> (MB) and tissue autofluorescence (AF) have been advocated to reduce the number of biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed their sensitivity and specificity compared with the standard approach-that is, endoscopy with 4QB-in the surveillance of a mixed BO population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty five consecutive BO patients (mean age 64.9 years; 30 men, five women) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AF endoscopy was followed by high resolution video endoscopy (VE) plus tissue staining with 0.5% MB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were taken from any suspicious area found on any of the above tests, in addition to 4QB every 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were classified as either positive or negative for the various tests used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathological results were used as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 35 study patients, a total of 345 biopsies showed low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) in 88 biopsies, high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) in 19 biopsies, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 12 biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity rates for AF and MB for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> versus BO mucosa without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were 21%/91% and 37%/91%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>4QB revealed five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>/HGD areas and 76 LGD areas not detected by AF, MB, or VE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The additional yield of MB and AF over VE with 4QB concerned only one HGD area (in the vicinity of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) and seven LGD areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Due to their low sensitivity, AF and MB are not suitable techniques for reducing the high numbers of routine biopsies needed for finding additional foci of HGD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Careful endoscopic observation and stepwise four quadrant biopsy therefore still represent the gold standard for surveillance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
