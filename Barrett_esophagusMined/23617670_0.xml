<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been described that most cases of Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in Japan are cases of Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> on a background of short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, frequently occurring rostrad to Barrett's epithelium, adjacent to the squamous epithelium of the right wall of the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> may spread below the squamous epithelium when the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is situated adjacent to the squamocolumnar junction, so that it is usually difficult to diagnose its presence and extent by conventional endoscopy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have noted that the spread of Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> below the squamous epithelium is recognizable as annular vascular formations (AVF) by magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI), and have verified it by 3-D stereo-reconstruction using serial sections from a specimen of the same lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When horizontal cross-sections of the tissue were viewed from the surface, AVF emerged at a depth of approximately 100 μm from the surface and disappeared at a depth of approximately 300 μm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it would be presumed to be difficult to visualize the characteristic structural features by ME-NBI if the carcinomatous glandular ducts were situated deeper than approximately 300 μm underneath a thick layer of squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thickness of the overlying squamous epithelium may be a limiting factor for whether or not the characteristic structural features can be detected </plain></SENT>
