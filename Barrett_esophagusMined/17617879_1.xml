<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate the incidence of duodeno-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in a series of duodeno-esophageal anastomosis operations in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This surgical method provides a model for reflux-induced esophageal pathologies, without carcinogen administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study design included the follow-up of 31 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty weeks of duodeno-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> significantly increased the risk of the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and reflux-induced esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> formation was evident in four animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one of these particular cases, a superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137,C0751688" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous cell cancer</z:e> was noted in close vicinity to the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For further analysis, a detailed immunohistochemical staining protocol was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotypes revealed cyclin D1 expression (nuclear positivity in 35% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the squamous cells), p53 protein accumulation (50% nuclear positivity), with a low expression of cox-2, and negative c-erbB2 staining in the squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells exhibited exclusively diffuse cox-2 positivity (90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> glandular cells) and weak focal c-erbB2 (5%) staining, without cyclin D1 expression or p53 protein accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to quantify the abundance of p53, cyclin D1 and cox-2 mRNAs in this biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most dramatic changes were observed in the level of expression of cyclin D1 (a 9.08-fold expression as compared with the non-treated esophagus samples), while the p53 and cox-2 gene expressions were increased by 1.61 and 2.45-fold, respectively, relative to the non-treated samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results afford evidence of the simultaneous activation of more than one possible carcinogenetic pathway in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Synchronous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> formation with different growth pattern characteristics is a rarity in humans, and this phenomenon suggests that the presented model is a suitable means of mimicking the whole spectrum of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> pathology </plain></SENT>
