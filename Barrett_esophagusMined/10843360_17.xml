<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Sixty-five consecutive patients with a 2-cm or shorter length of endoscopically visible CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: The type of CLE and the presence of Helicobacter pylori were determined by histopathologic examination of esophageal and gastric antrum biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent esophageal manometry and simultaneous 24-hour pH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and physiological data were compared in patients with and without IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six patients had IM and 29 had cardiac-type mucosa without IM in biopsy specimens from the CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in age or sex distribution, but the duration of symptoms was significantly longer in patients with IM (10 vs 5 years; P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Abnormal esophageal acid exposure was found in 30 (83%) of 36 patients with IM and 23 (79%) of 29 patients without IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of abnormal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> exposure was significantly higher in patients with IM (75% [27/36]) than in those without IM (41% [12/29]; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e> between the 2 groups (8% vs 10%; P &gt;.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with short segments of CLE and IM have similar esophageal acid exposure but significantly higher frequency of abnormal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> exposure and longer median duration of reflux symptoms than patients without IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CLE, regardless of histological type, is a manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of duodenoesophageal reflux and the duration of reflux seem to be important in the pathogenesis of IM </plain></SENT>
