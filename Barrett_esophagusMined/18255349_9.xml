<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed whether pretreatment variables, including prior endoscopic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, are associated with post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> stricturing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had undergone <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> with porfimer <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, or T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at our institution since 1997 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred sixteen patients underwent 160 courses of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of stricture formation after index <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was 16% (19/116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> courses, the overall incidence of stricture was 23% (37/160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stricture rate was significantly higher after a second <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> course compared with index <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> (43% vs 16%, P = .0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no association between post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> stricture development and age, gender, body mass index, or prior endoscopic mucosal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed a stricture had a longer length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> before treatment than those who did not develop a stricture (7.7 vs 5.7 cm for index <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> only, P = .025; 7.4 vs 5.7 cm for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> courses, P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, multiple <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> courses, and presence of intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> on pretreatment pathology were independent predictors of post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> stricture in a stepwise logistic regression analysis controlling for treatment variables, including treatment length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk of stricture development was seen after multiple courses of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An association between post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> stricture and length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> but not treatment length was also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic mucosal resection did not appear to influence the likelihood of stricture development after porfimer <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-based <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
