<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ki67/DNA content multiparameter flow cytometry and DNA content flow cytometry were used to investigate G0, G1, and S phase fractions in advancing stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In control biopsy specimens from gastric mucosa, G1, S phase, and total Ki67-positive proliferative fractions were low, suggesting that cells were predominantly in G0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ki67-positive G1 fractions were increased in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> were characterized by a subset of biopsy specimens that had aneuploid cell populations, increased S phase fractions, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The development of increased G1 fractions is an early event in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased S phase fractions occur in a subset of specimens typically at more advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> and often in association with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is associated with at least three types of cell cycle abnormalities: (1) mobilization from G0 into G1; (2) loss of control of the G1/S phase transition; and (3) accumulation in G2 </plain></SENT>
