<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common gains were at 20q (56%) and 17q (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-level amplifications were observed in the same chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common losses were in chromosomes 4 (22%) and 5 (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other recurrent changes were gains of chromosomes 8, 10q, and 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the copy number changes in Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and those previously reported in the intestinal type of stomach <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The similarities we found suggest a common molecular pathogenesis, whereas dissimilarities seen between Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> are in keeping with a well-known different etiology </plain></SENT>
