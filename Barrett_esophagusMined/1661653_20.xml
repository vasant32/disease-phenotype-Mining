<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to assess potential abnormalities in the control of mucosal proliferation, 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were studied in order to evaluate the presence and distribution of epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor to determine the Ki-67 labelling index in the affected oesophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial sections were analysed immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten of the patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the Barrett's mucosa and the other 20 had differing histological types of Barrett's mucosa (10, intestinal-type; 10, fundic- or cardiac-type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of transforming growth factor-alpha, epidermal growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor was increased and the Ki-67 labelling index was higher in Barrett's mucosa compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 'intestinal-type' of Barrett's mucosa had the greatest expression of transforming growth factor-alpha, epidermal growth factor receptor and the highest Ki-67 labelling index compared with the other types of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five cases of 'intestinal-type' Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> had especially high Ki-67 labelling indices and these patients over-expressed both transforming growth factor-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in the Barrett's mucosa also over-expressed transforming growth factor-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor, but not epidermal growth factor, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa and Barrett's mucosa have potential autocrine growth regulatory mechanisms, but Barrett's mucosa has increased expression of both of the measured ligands and of the epidermal growth factor receptor </plain></SENT>
