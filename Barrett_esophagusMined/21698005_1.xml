<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spectrally encoded confocal microscopy (SECM) is a high-speed reflectance confocal microscopy technology that can be configured to image the entire distal esophagus by helically scanning the beam using optics within a balloon-centering probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is challenging to image the human esophagus in vivo with balloon-based SECM, however, because patient motion and anatomic tissue surface irregularities decenter the optics, making it difficult to keep the focus at a predetermined location within the tissue as the beam is scanned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we present a SECM probe equipped with an adaptive focusing mechanism that can compensate for tissue surface irregularity and dynamic focal variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A tilted arrangement of the objective lens is employed in the SECM probe to provide feedback signals to an adaptive focusing mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The tilted configuration also allows the probe to obtain reflectance confocal data from multiple depth levels, enabling the acquisition of three-dimensional volumetric data during a single scan of the probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A tissue phantom with a surface area of 12.6 cm(2) was imaged using the new SECM probe, and 8 large-area reflectance confocal microscopy images were acquired over the depth range of 56 Î¼m in 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large-area SECM images of excised swine small intestine tissue were also acquired, enabling the visualization of villous architecture, epithelium, and lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adaptive focusing mechanism was demonstrated to enable acquisition of in-focus images even when the probe was not centered and the tissue surface was irregular </plain></SENT>
