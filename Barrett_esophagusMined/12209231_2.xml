<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A classification of the severity of the stricture is proposed, based on its internal diameter, its length, and the ease or difficulty in dilating it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 185 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> secondary to reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 77 (41.6%) corresponded to type I or mild stricture, 73 (39.4%) to type II or moderate, and 35 (19.6%) to type III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment was performed in only 15 cases, with 73% recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three types of surgical procedures were employed, always after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, improvement of nutritional status, and a complete preoperative work-up: (1) conservative antireflux surgery, which had a high incidence of recurrence (41.1%); (2) acid suppression and duodenal diversion, in which 68 patients had a mortality rate of 2.9% and a recurrence rate of 4.4% (p &lt;0.002); and (3) esophageal resection, which in 7 patients resulted in 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and no late recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that classification of the severity of the stricture is important to indicate the most appropriate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conservative antireflux surgery is followed by a high recurrence rate at late follow-up, whereas acid suppression and duodenal diversion seem to be an adequate procedure that is followed by a very low recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Esophageal resection is indicated only for patients with severe or critical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
