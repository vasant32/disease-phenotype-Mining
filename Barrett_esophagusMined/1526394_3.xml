<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the severity and "extent" of acid exposure in patients with BE using an automated single or two-channel 24-hour pH monitoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with histologically proven BE were compared with 3 other groups: a) 100 patients with clinical symptoms and pHmetrically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> divided in 2 sub-groups: 38 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> at endoscopy, and 62 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (Savary-Miller classification; grade I: n = 24, grade II: n = 27, grade III: n = 8, grade IV: n = 3) and b) 9 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients with BE, and in 14 patients with reflux and healthy volunteers, 2 electrodes were placed 5 (electrode E1) and 10 cm (electrode E2) above the lower esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the other patients, pH was monitored using a single pH electrode (E1) only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mucosal acid exposure at E1 (percentage of time below pH 4 on total period, day and night), the number of reflux episodes longer than 5 min were significantly higher in the BE group when compared with the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with abnormal acid exposure at E2 was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in the BE group (15/17 cases) than in the reflux group (5/14 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> was significantly longer in BE than in other groups at both recording sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
