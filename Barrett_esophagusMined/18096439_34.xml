<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Recent studies have claimed long <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>-free survival rates with endoscopic mucosal resection of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, reports have contended that approximately 40% of patients who have esophagectomy for HGD have occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to use explicit criteria to determine the true prevalence of invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in reports of patients who had esophagectomy for HGD in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies reporting rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in patients who underwent esophagectomy for HGD in BE were gathered using MEDLINE and PUBMED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We defined invasive esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (IEAC) as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with submucosal invasion or beyond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IMC) was not considered IEAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three articles were selected for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most investigators reported rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> in the esophagectomy specimen, and the pooled average was 39.9% among the 441 patients who underwent an esophagectomy for HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reported rates varied from 0% to 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 267 patients had American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> stage 0 postoperatively, 132 patients had stage I, 23 patients had stage IIa, 10 patients had stage IIb, and 9 patients had stage III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen studies provided differentiation between intramucosal and submucosal invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among 213 patients, only 12.7% had IEAC, whereas 87.3% had HGD or IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The IEAC rate of 11% among patients with visible lesions is greater than the rate of 3% among patients with no visible lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By using strict pathologic definitions of invasive disease, the present study indicates the true prevalence of IEAC in BE and HGD may have been overestimated significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Separating IMC from IEAC is clinically relevant because endoscopic techniques potentially may treat IMC </plain></SENT>
