<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare some validated biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (Ki-67, p53, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) between 2 groups of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) undergoing randomly medical or surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The treatment of choice to prevent the malignant progression of BE remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Translational studies using biomarkers associated with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathway could be useful to provide some information in this regard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group consisted of 45 patients: 20 under medical treatment with 40 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) and 25 after Nissen fundoplication (NFP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 8 years (range, 5-10 years), the values of Ki-67, p53, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before treatment (n = 45) and then 1 year (n = 45), 3 years (n = 45), 5 years (n = 45), and 10 years (n = 25) afterwards in both groups of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These values were also analyzed in 2 subgroups of patients with successful medical and surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both Ki-67 and p53 remained stable after NFP, whereas they increased progressively in patients under <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> with statistically significant differences between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the apoptotic index increased progressively after NFP and decreased in the patients under <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> with significant differences at 3, 5, and 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On comparing the subgroups of successful treatment the same differences were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Barrett's epithelium remains more stable after a long-term follow-up in patients with BE treated surgically than in those under <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> even in the absence of abnormal rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
