<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Human chorionic gonadotrophin beta (hCGbeta) is expressed in several non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041182" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">trophoblastic tumours</z:e>, and this is usually associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behaviour</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about hCGbeta expression in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the hCGbeta profile in a large series of surgically resected Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (a) at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level using real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and (b) at protein level using immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal antibody and with a monoclonal antibody specific for free hCGbeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then sought links between the hCGbeta protein expression pattern and clinical and pathological parameters, including patient outcome as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: hCGbeta protein expression was observed in 43 of 76 (57%) Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We showed a strong correlation between hCGbeta protein abundance and CGB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a statistical link between hCGbeta protein expression and infiltrative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> type ( P=0.023), perineural neoplastic invasion ( P=0.007) and VEGF protein expression ( P=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>hCGbeta expression tended to be associated with a poor outcome (16% versus 36% survival 8 years after resection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Expression of hCGbeta correlates with specific infiltrative characteristics and is associated with higher VEGF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both molecules may play a co-ordinated role in the development of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
