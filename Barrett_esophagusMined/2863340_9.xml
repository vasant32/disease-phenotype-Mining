<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, EC cells were localized using a cytochemical silver staining method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that EC cells and gastrin- and somatostatin-containing <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells are detectable in Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
