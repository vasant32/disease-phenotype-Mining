<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare efficacy of effervescent <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> to as-needed <z:chebi fb="43" ids="3311">calcium carbonate</z:chebi> antacids in subjects who self-treat heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 155 subjects with frequent antacid-responsive heartburn were randomized to receive effervescent <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> 150 mg tablets b.d., or as-needed <z:chebi fb="43" ids="3311">calcium carbonate</z:chebi> 750 mg for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> severity and mucosal histology were assessed at baseline, and at weeks 6 and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heartburn frequency, severity, and antacid consumption were recorded daily, and quality of life was assessed at baseline, and at weeks 6 and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Heartburn frequency and severity were significantly decreased after 1 day of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By week 6, <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> had significantly decreased rescue antacid consumption (7.3 tablets, P &lt; 0.001) vs. antacids (14.1 tablets) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> healing (&lt;/= grade 1) was significantly better with <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> (55%, P=0.022) vs. antacids (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was improved by both treatments; however, <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> was numerically superior for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> quality of life parameters, statistically superior for several quality of life indices at week 6 and for the pain-related index by week 12 (P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For subjects self-administering antacids for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> heartburn, effervescent <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> 150 mg b.d. is more effective than antacids in reducing heartburn, healing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267055" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erosive oesophagitis</z:e>, alleviating pain, and improving quality of life </plain></SENT>
