<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>Chromosomal instability</z:mp>, as assessed by many techniques, including DNA content <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, loss of heterozygosity, and comparative genomic hybridization, has consistently been reported to be common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and rare in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a panel of chromosome instability biomarkers, including loss of heterozygosity and DNA content, has been reported to identify patients at high and low risk of progression from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA), but required multiple platforms for implementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> involving amplifications and deletions of chromosome regions have been observed in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, copy number alterations (CNA) in premalignant tissues have not been well characterized or evaluated in cohort studies as biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined CNAs in 98 patients having either BE or EA using <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> Artificial Chromosome (BAC) array comparative genomic hybridization to characterize CNAs at different stages of progression ranging from early BE to advanced EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CNAs were rare in early stages (less than high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) but were progressively more frequent and larger in later stages (high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EA), including high-level amplifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of CNAs correlated highly with DNA content <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients whose biopsies contained CNAs involving &gt;70 Mbp were at increased risk of progression to DNA content abnormalities or EA (hazards ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-14.8; P = 0.0047), and the risk increased as more of the genome was affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide analysis of CNAs provides a common platform for the evaluation of chromosome instability for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk assessment as well as for the identification of common regions of alteration that can be further studied for biomarker discovery </plain></SENT>
