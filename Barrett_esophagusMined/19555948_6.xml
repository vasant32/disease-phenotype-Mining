<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prior studies report the presence of buried Barrett's epithelium under squamous mucosa after endoscopic ablative therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there still exists significant controversy about whether these glands represent a neoablative phenomenon or predate endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of buried BE underneath squamous epithelium on initial mucosectomy specimens for complete Barrett's eradication EMR (CBE-EMR) for BE with HGD or IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective double-blinded review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary-care academic referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Histopathology slides of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> initial mucosectomy specimens for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent CBE-EMR for BE with HGD or IMC at our center between August 2003 and February 2008 were reviewed retrospectively in a double-blinded fashion by 2 expert GI pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had undergone prior endoscopic ablative therapy for dysplastic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The prevalence of buried BE underneath squamous epithelium in initial mucosectomy specimens from CBE-EMR for BE with HGD or IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 47 patients' initial mucosectomy slides were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of Barrett's epithelium underneath the squamous resection margin (Z line) was identified in 13 of 47 patients (28%) at initial mucosectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The linear distance of the Barrett's epithelium from the resection's squamous margin ranged from 0.8 to 5.6 mm (mean 2.3 mm and median 1.9 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histopathology revealed nondysplastic buried BE in 3 patients, HGD in 9 patients, and IMC in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, 10 of 13 patients (21% of 47 total) had buried glands with advanced pathology (HGD or IMC), whereas 3 of 13 (6% of 47 total) had specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: A single-center, modest study population size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed a significant prevalence of buried Barrett's epithelium with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> under squamous mucosa (squamocolumnar junction) on initial mucosectomy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Given the neoplastic potential of BE, the presence of these subsquamous BE glands may affect the extent and adequacy of mucosal resection margins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, surveillance biopsies and ablative therapy should extend to 1 cm proximal to the endoscopically determined squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
