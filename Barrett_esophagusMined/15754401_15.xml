<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To report the long-term outcome of patients after complete ablation of non-neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) with respect to BE relapse and development of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 70 patients with histologically proven non-neoplastic BE, complete BE ablation was achieved by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy (120 mg <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients (94.4%) underwent further surveillance endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At each surveillance endoscopy four-quadrant biopsies were taken from the neo-squamous epithelium at 2 cm intervals depending on the pre-treatment length of BE mucosa beginning at the neo-Z-line, and from any endoscopically suspicious lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up of 66 patients was 51 mo (range 9-85 mo) giving a total of 280.5 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mean of 6 biopsies were taken during surveillance endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients (19.7%) tongues or islands suspicious for BE were found during endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 8 of these patients (12.1%) non-neoplastic BE relapse was confirmed histologically giving a histological relapse rate of 3% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In none of the patients, intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> nor an esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis identified endoscopic detection of islands or tongues as the only positive predictor of BE relapse (P = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The long-term relapse rate of non-neoplastic BE following complete ablation with high-power APC is low (3% per year) </plain></SENT>
