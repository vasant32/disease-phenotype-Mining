<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicate that the prevalence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE) in China is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RE is one of the most common esophageal complications associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) and RE-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>-esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) sequence has been considered as an histogenesis model for EAC in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RE is only present in a subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, suggesting an altered susceptibility to RE may exist in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the genetic changes related with high susceptibility to RE is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferases (GSTs) T1, M1 and P1 have been reported with high susceptibity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in Chinese people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present case-control study was thus undertaken to characterize the genetic polymorphisms of GSTs and their correlation with susceptibility to RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and nine patients with RE, 97 patients with nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) and 97 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were recruited in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the subjects were from Beijing, China, and received endoscopic examination and questionnaires for RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from the lymphocytes of peripheral blood for each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genotypes of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes were analyzed by a multiplex PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A--&gt;G polymorphism of codon 104 of the GSTP1 gene was detected using PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The variant GSTP1 genotypes (*A/*Bomicron*B/*B) was found with a high frequency in the case with RE (40%), and followed by NERD (25%) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The differences were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The risk for RE increased 2.42-fold [odds ratio (OR); 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.42 (1.22-4.80)] in the subjects with variant GSTP1 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The subjects with positive variant GSTP1 genotypes and negative H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> showed increasing tendency for risk of RE [OR (95% CI), 2.67 (1.06-6.70)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the subjects with GSTT1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms did not show any correlation with high risk for RE or NERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No significant interactions were identified between the variant GSTs and cigarette smoking, or alcohol drinking and subtype of RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The present result suggests that GSTP1 genetic polymorphism may be one of the high susceptibility factors involved in the mechanisms of RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> may play a protective role against RE </plain></SENT>
