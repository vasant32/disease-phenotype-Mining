<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> develops in 5-10% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and predisposes to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that a systematic baseline endoscopic biopsy protocol using flow cytometry with histology identifies subsets of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at low and high risk for progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we further examined cytometric variables to better define the characteristics that best enable DNA cytometry to help predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were prospectively evaluated using a systematic endoscopic biopsy protocol, with baseline histological and flow cytometric measurements as predictors and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> as the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A receiver operating curve analysis demonstrated that a 4N fraction cut point of 6% was optimal to discriminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk (relative risk [RR] = 11.7, 95% CI = 6.2-22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 4N fractions of 6-15% were just as predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> as were fractions of &gt;15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that only aneuploid DNA contents of &gt;2.7N were predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (RR = 9.5, CI = 4.9-18), whereas those patients whose sole abnormality was an aneuploid population with DNA content of &lt; or =2.7 had a low risk for progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of both 4N fraction of &gt;6% and aneuploid DNA content of &gt;2.7N was highly predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (RR = 23, CI = 10-50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>S phase was a predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk (RR = 2.3, CI = 1.2-4.4) but was not significant when high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was accounted for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry is a useful adjunct to histology in assessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Careful examination of cytometric variables revealed a better definition of those parameters that are most closely associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
