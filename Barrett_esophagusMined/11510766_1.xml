<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the cost-effectiveness of surveillance of this lesion is also important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optimal <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> test strategy should be determined, as well as the appropriate therapeutic strategy that follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This will need to be determined in each of the clinical presentations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, both typical and atypical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, we have almost no information regarding appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of supraesophageal manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given the enormous health care burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> alone in this country, this is obviously an area requiring a high priority for research efforts </plain></SENT>
