<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to report the ECE findings in patients with GER symptoms and validate a new scoring system to assess ECE video quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five hundred two ECE were performed in patients with GER symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We devised a new grading scale called ECE Utility score to assess the quality of images using five different parameters: anatomic landmarks visualized, esophageal transit time, image quality, illumination, and artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ECE cases were independently scored by two interpreters in a randomized, blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was diagnosed via ECE in 254 patients (50.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified 12 cases (2.4%) with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them had endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> on esophagogastroduodenoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologic confirmation <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was found in six patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the 502 cases, mean ± standard deviation total ECE Utility score was 8.89 ± 0.96 for interpreter 1 and 8.96 ± 0.93 for interpreter 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The concordance rate between the two interpreters for the ECE Utility score ranged from 75.9-96.8% across the parameters and the Pearson correlation rate of the total score was 0.81 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ECE is shown to be a simple noninvasive valuable technique for evaluating esophageal mucosa and producing high quality images in patients with GER symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ECE can help as an alternative screening tool for diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
