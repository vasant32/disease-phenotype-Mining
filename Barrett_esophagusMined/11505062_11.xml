<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> persists in Barrett's mucosa after reflux control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It remains at risk for uncontrolled cellular proliferation and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had a mean follow-up of 4 years after a Collis-Nissen gastroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proliferative activity was assayed immunohistochemically for Ki-67 expression in 73 preoperative and 176 postoperative biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation with manometric and 24-hour pH results was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Collis-Nissen gastroplasty restored the median lower esophageal sphincter gradient from 5.5 mmHg before surgery to 14.5 mmHg at 24 months and 12.9 mmHg at 48 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median esophageal acid exposure was reduced from 8% to 1% and 1% of recording time, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median Ki-67 labeling index increased from 28.5% before surgery to 36.1% at 12 to 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It returned to preoperative level (26.9%) at 24 to 47 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After surgery, abnormal intraesophageal acid exposure was documented in 12 patients but could not be correlated with sphincter pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After surgery, the pattern of proliferation in patients with acid exposure less than 4% in their esophagus showed significant differences when compared with the proliferation pattern of patients where abnormal intraesophageal acid exposure was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>New present <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was observed only in patients with abnormal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Barrett's mucosa, from preoperative values, proliferation peaked early after surgery and then decreased to preoperative levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite sphincter restoration and global reflux control, abnormal esophageal acid exposure persisted in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with abnormal esophageal acid exposure displayed more proliferation and more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
