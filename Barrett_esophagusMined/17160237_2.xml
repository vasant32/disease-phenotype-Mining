<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In western societies, the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the gastroesophageal junction has increased in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is commonly accepted today that esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> develops from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is hardly diagnosed at early stages, which results in significant mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular biology studies have shown that most <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> originate from the interaction between inherited characteristics and external factors, which may cause genetic changes that interfere with the control over the differentiation and growth of cells in susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p21 (WAF1/CIP1) has a key role in the regulation of the cell cycle, and its immunohistochemical expression has been investigated in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, showing that it influences the prognosis of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AIM: To check the prevalence of p21 protein expression in patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> diagnosed in the last 5 years by the Group for Surgeries of the Esophagus and Stomach of "Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre", RS, Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 42 patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> diagnosed by the Group for Surgeries of the Esophagus and Stomach between January 1998 and December 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of p21 protein was determined by immunohistochemistry using primary antibody, p21, clone SX118, code M7202 (Dako), and assessed according to the immunoreactive scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 42 analyzed patients, 83.3% were male and older than 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among these, 56.2% were submitted to curative resection: total gastrectomy and transhiatal esophagogastrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients were submitted to palliative surgery or did not undergo any surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only five patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy, either alone or combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Advanced disease (stages III and IV) was detected in 78.6% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only nine patients were positive for p21, according to the immunoreactive scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: p21 was expressed in 9 of 42 patients (21.4%) with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> diagnosed in the last 5 years by the Group for Surgeries of the Esophagus and Stomach of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In our patient population, the accumulation of p21 did not play a key role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
