<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pediatric data are still limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis requires clinician awareness of symptomatic cases who present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>swallowing difficulties</z:hpo>, and thorough endoscopic examination is crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early detection of cases provides favorable clinical outcome and may prevent potential significant or serious long-term consequences such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> or web, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reported a 14-year-old male who presented with 1-year history of gradually worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and was found to have two salmon-colored patches, which resemble gastric mucosa, in the proximal esophagus causing significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After several sessions of balloon dilation and endoscopic treatment, the HGM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> resolved and he became asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
