<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish if a relationship exists between the pH profile in the oesophagus and stomach and the development of complications in patients with Barrett's columnar lined lower oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty four hour ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring was performed in 26 patients with Barrett's columnar lined lower oesophagus and combined with 24 hour ambulatory gastric pH monitoring in 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 26 with Barrett's columnar lined lower oesophagus had complications including stricture (eight), deep ulceration (one), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oesophageal acid exposure (% time &lt; pH 4) was similar in patients with or without complications (19.2% v 19.3% p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oesophageal alkaline exposure (% time &gt; pH 7) was greater in patients with complications (24.2% v 8.4% p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 16 patients who underwent gastric pH monitoring there was a clear relationship between gastric and oesophageal alkalinisation in 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that complications in Barrett's columnar lined lower oesophagus develop in association with increased exposure of the oesophagus to an alkaline environment which appears to be secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The routine use of 24 hour ambulatory gastric pH monitoring in conjunction with oesophageal pH monitoring can help identify those patients at risk </plain></SENT>
