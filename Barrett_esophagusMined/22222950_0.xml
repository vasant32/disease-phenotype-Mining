<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of inlet patches and their association with other conditions of the gastrointestinal tract have been studied prospectively in tertiary care facilities; little is known about practice patterns in private outpatient clinics and endoscopy centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess prevalence, demographic determinants, and associated clinicopathologic features of inlet patches in patients who had oesophagogastroduodenoscopy in outpatient settings throughout the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the clinicopathologic records of 487,229 unique patients who had oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies between January 2008 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 870 patients with inlet patches with a prevalence of 0.18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant associations included male gender (OR 1.68), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (OR 1.34), upper respiratory complaints (OR 2.81), globus (OR 5.39) Barrett oesophagus (OR 1.55), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arising in Barrett mucosa (OR 5.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of inlet patches in a tertiary care setting (0.18%) was considerably lower than reported in prospective studies (3.7% on average) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inlet patches were significantly associated with male gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, upper respiratory complaints, globus, Barrett mucosa, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arising in Barrett oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be needed to determine if patients with inlet patches and Barrett mucosa benefit from increased surveillance </plain></SENT>
