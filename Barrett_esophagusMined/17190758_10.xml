<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several studies have shown that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) therapy is a suitable procedure to eradicate Barrett's epithelium for a short-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The real impact of this kind of management with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk and durability of squamous regeneration remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the follow-up data for up to 51 months after eradication of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 1998-2001, 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were included in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After baseline documentation, Barrett's epithelium was treated with repeated APC until complete squamous restoration was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were continuously treated with high-dose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each patient underwent a median of four APC sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (84%) of the patients had complete squamous regeneration at the end of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up of up to 51 months, Barrett's epithelium was found to have recurred in 14/21 (66%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Including the patients with initially incomplete squamous restoration, a long-lasting and complete effect was achieved in only 7 patients (28%) after a mean follow-up period of 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: So far, it is still not proven whether coagulation-induced squamous regeneration reduces the risk of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the high relapse rate, the procedure-related risk, and the high costs incurred preclude the routine use of APC for the treatment of non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The different recurrence rates between published studies may be due to technical differences and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suggest that optimal conditions for the procedure must be defined before further studies are undertaken </plain></SENT>
