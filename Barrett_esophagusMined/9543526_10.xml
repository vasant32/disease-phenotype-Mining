<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The premalignant potential of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has stimulated efforts to find a way to ablate the columnar epithelium in order to reheal the area with squamous epithelium, thus obviating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes and evaluates a new technique using ultrasonic energy to ablate the epithelium of the lower esophagus in a porcine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight young farm pigs were used to develop the technique of applying a laparoscopic Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) to the lower esophageal mucosa through an operating gastrostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A further 11 Yakutan minipigs then underwent CUSA epithelial ablation, followed by a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication or postoperative acid suppression therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then assessed the healing response in these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Optimal CUSA energy settings enabled complete ablation of the squamous epithelium with preservation of the muscularis mucosa and submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The integrity of the aspirated cells was sufficient for cytological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Healing occurred by squamous regeneration without stricture formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CUSA technique holds promise for complete ablation of the Barrett's epithelium in a single setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The unique tissue-selective nature of the ablative process allows complete mucosal reepithelialization without stricture formation </plain></SENT>
