<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is one of the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> and can progress to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The numerous molecular events may play a role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> of Barrett's mucosa such as the change of DNA ploidy, p53 mutation and alteration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanism of the progression of BE to EA remains unclear and most studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) mutations in BE have performed on BE with the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS/FINDINGS: Thus, the current study is to investigate new molecular events (Barrett's esophageal tissue-specific-mtDNA alterations/instabilities) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genome and causative factors for their alterations using the corresponding adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal tissue (NT) and tissue (BT) from 34 patients having Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> without the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (53%) exhibited mtDNA mutations which were not found in adjacent NT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>mtDNA copy number was about 3 times higher in BT than in adjacent NT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory chain enzyme complexes in tissues from Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> without the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in BT was significantly higher than those in corresponding samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: High ROS level in BT may contribute to the development of mtDNA mutations, which may play a crucial role in disease progression and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in BE </plain></SENT>
