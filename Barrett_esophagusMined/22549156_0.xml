<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite a characteristic histology, the pathogenesis of Barrett's has remained obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A recent paper from the laboratories of Wa Xian and Frank McKeon presents evidence for a novel cell of origin of Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their work is based on studies of mice engineered to lack the squamous epithelial stem cell survival factor p63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These mice develop a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the proximal stomach and esophagus that harbors substantial histological and molecular features of Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> appears to form from embryonic progenitor cells that normally persists post-natally only at the squamo-columnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in their model, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is initiated not by mutation but by reduced competition between these cells and squamous epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
