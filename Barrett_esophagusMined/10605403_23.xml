<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Histological specimens from 100 cases of Barrett oesophagus and 100 samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous oesophageal epithelium were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a system of multiple measurements until the change in cumulative mean values varied by less than 5%, the overall mean and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of depth was calculated for each type of epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Barrett columnar epithelium is minimally thicker (mean (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) 0.50 (0.004) mm; range 0.39 to 0.59 mm) than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium (0.49 (0.003) mm; 0.42 to 0.58 mm), although this difference is probably too small to be of clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although there are numerous clinical reports of various methods of ablation treatment for Barrett oesophagus, little attention has been paid to the depth of tissue destruction required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to look specifically at this issue, and it provides information on the necessary depth of epithelial ablation </plain></SENT>
