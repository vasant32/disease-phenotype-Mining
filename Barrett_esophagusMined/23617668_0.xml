<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This preliminary feasibility study assessed the utility of a novel narrow-band imaging (NBI) system (Olympus Exera III; 190 series) both as a detection and as a characterization tool in patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and twenty-one areas in 40 patients with BE were examined prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The BE segment was initially evaluated with NBI overview as a 'red flag' technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal areas identified with NBI overview were then further interrogated with NBI and a dual focus (DF) magnification system (NBI-DF) in order to aid characterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> areas on NBI overview were also systematically assessed with NBI-DF systematically (four quadrants every 2â€‰cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A confidence system was utilized when each area was assessed with NBI-DF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> areas on NBI-DF were classified into three easily distinguishable mucosal patterns: (i) regular pits with regular microvasculature (no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>); (ii) irregular pits with irregular microvasculature (early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>/high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> [HGD]); and (iii) equivocal, where the endoscopist was not sure about the pattern (this could be areas with increased brownish discoloration on NBI overview and <z:mp ids='MP_0004938'>dilated vasculature</z:mp> but no change in caliber on NBI-DF [likely <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>: LGD]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corresponding biopsies of each area were then taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and negative predictive value (NPV) of both modes (NBI overview and NBI-DF) were then compared with the final histopathological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eighty-three of 221 areas (82.8%) did not exhibit any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on final histopathological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NBI overview and NBI-DF accurately called <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these areas as non-dysplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 38 areas that appeared suspicious on NBI overview were also further assessed with NBI-DF: seven of seven were accurately predicted as harboring no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; nine areas were predicted as irregular, of which four harbored early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, one HGD, three LGD and one <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on final histopathology assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two areas were deemed to be equivocal (final histology: 18 LGD and four <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Sn, Sp, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and NPV for the prediction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> using NBI overview and NBI-DF were thus 100%, 93.8%, 68.6%, 100% and 100%, 86.2%, 73.3%, 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If NBI-DF was used in addition to NBI overview, biopsies would have been avoided in 190 areas (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and HGD could be accurately identified </plain></SENT>
