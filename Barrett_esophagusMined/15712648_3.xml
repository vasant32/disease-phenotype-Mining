<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Surgical esophagectomy, intensive endoscopic surveillance, and mucosal ablative techniques, particularly photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>), have been proposed as possible management strategies for Barrett's high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each option has advantages and disadvantages, and no firm consensus exists for the preferred strategy at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this pilot study was to gain insight into patient preferences in Barrett's HGD management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were enrolled in a questionnaire study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three possible management options for Barrett's HGD including each option's potential benefits and harms were presented to the subject in a formalized presentation that was designed to be easily comprehendible by patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subjects rated each strategy using a health-related quality of life instrument and chose one of the management strategies assuming they were found to have HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average feeling thermometer rating scale values for the management strategies were as follows: endoscopic surveillance, 79; esophagectomy, 46; and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When asked to choose a strategy, 14 (70%) chose endoscopic surveillance, 3 (15%) chose esophagectomy, and 3 (15%) chose <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings were statistically significant (P = 0.0024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients who chose endoscopic surveillance felt "comfortable" with endoscopy, while the most common concern about esophagectomy, and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the unknown risk of recurrence, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, when patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were presented with three options to manage HGD, the majority chose endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Familiarity with endoscopic surveillance was the predominant reason for the choice </plain></SENT>
