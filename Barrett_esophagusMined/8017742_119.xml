<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> resistant to treatment with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>-2 (H2)-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cohort analytic study with a mean follow-up of 48 months (range, 36 to 64 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Patients receiving ambulatory care from referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 91 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> resistant to treatment with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37961">H2-receptor antagonist</z:chebi> but subsequently responsive to 40 mg of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Open maintenance therapy consisting of 20 mg of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> daily in 86 patients and 40 mg daily in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: Endoscopy to assess healing; side effects, laboratory values, fasting serum gastrin level, and gastric corpus biopsies to assess safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>Esophagitis</z:hpo> recurred in 47% of the patients receiving 20 mg of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> daily, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rehealed after the dose was doubled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of 40 patients (18%) had a second relapse after a mean follow-up time of 24 months (range, 9 to 36 months) that was successfully treated with a further 20-mg dose increment for a mean period of 36 months (range, 6 to 39 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median gastrin levels increased initially from 60 ng/L before study entry to 162 ng/L (P &lt; 0.01) with treatment and reached a plateau during maintenance treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Very high gastrin levels (&gt; 500 ng/L) were observed in a subgroup (11%) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of micronodular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> increased from 2.5% of the patients at first biopsy to 20% at the last biopsy (P = 0.001), with a corresponding progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> to subatrophic or atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> from less than 1% to 25% (P &lt; 0.001), which was more pronounced in patients with very high serum gastrin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance therapy with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> was effective for at least 5 years in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> resistant to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37961">H2-receptor antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment was accompanied by a persistent increase in serum gastrin levels and an increase of micronodular argyrophil cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and subatrophic or atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
