<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An acid pulse induces hyperproliferation, whereas continuous acid exposure promotes differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the mechanism for acid pulse-induced hyperproliferation, we studied the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>/H+ exchanger (NHE), which plays a role in the control of intracellular pH and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NHE was inhibited pharmacologically in endoscopic BE biopsies using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2639">amiloride</z:chebi> analogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was assessed after pulsed or continuous acid exposure using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53526">tritiated thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation assays and immunohistochemical analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NHE-dependent intracellular pH response to an acid pulse was examined by pH-sensitive microfluorimetry using a Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line TE7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NHE inhibition significantly reduced the hyperproliferative acid-pulse effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the acid-pulse activation of NHE occurred via increased transporter activity (22Na uptake) without any change in NHE-1 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC), an NHE activator, also reduced the hyperproliferative response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The response of TE7 cells to an acid pulse was similar to that of BE biopsies in terms of cell proliferation and NHE and PKC dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Acid-pulse exposure of TE7 cells resulted in intracellular acidification followed by reneutralization to an intracellular pH greater than preacidosis values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that NHE may mediate the hyperproliferative response of BE to an acid pulse via changes in intracellular pH </plain></SENT>
