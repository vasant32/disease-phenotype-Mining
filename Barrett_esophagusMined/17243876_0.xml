<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The benefits of routine gastrostroscopy before laparoscopic cholecystectomy have been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some cases of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> after laparoscopic cholecystectomy have been attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the significance of preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy in patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared a group of patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy before laparoscopic cholecystectomy and a group of patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with no preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, esophagogastroduodenoscopy findings, hospital stay, and other variables were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 400 patients in this study: 218 (54.5%) patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy while 182 (45.5%) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 49.8 years, 311 were female and 89 were male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty seven (31.7%) patients were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001082'>cholecystitis</z:hpo> and 273 (68.2%) were nonacute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the esophagogastroduodenoscopy group, there were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings in 98 (45%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> (21%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo> (3.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (3.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcer</z:hpo> (0.4%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (0.4%) were among the findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was avoided in six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001082'>cholecystitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy did not reduce the incidence of postoperative residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>; in fact, patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy had longer hospital stays (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001082'>cholecystitis</z:hpo>, esophagogastroduodenoscopy did not change the course of the planned surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001082'>cholecystitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy does not have an impact on postoperative residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>; however, it can disclose other gastroesophageal disorders with similar symptoms to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> and may change the course of the planned surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001082'>cholecystitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
