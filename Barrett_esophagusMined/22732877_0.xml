<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend that endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) be performed by using a strict biopsy protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, novel methods to improve BE surveillance are still needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of Barrett's inspection time (<z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BIT</z:chebi>) on yield of surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of data obtained from a clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Five tertiary referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients undergoing BE surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Coordinators prospectively recorded the time spent inspecting the BE mucosa with a stopwatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Endoscopically suspicious lesions, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD)/esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 112 patients underwent endoscopic surveillance by 11 individual endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with longer <z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BITs</z:chebi> were more likely to have an endoscopically suspicious lesion (P &lt; .001) and more endoscopically suspicious lesions (P = .0001) and receive a diagnosis of HGD/EAC (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a direct correlation between the endoscopist's mean <z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BIT</z:chebi> per centimeter of BE and the detection of patients with HGD/EAC (œÅ = .63, P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopists who had an average <z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BIT</z:chebi> longer than 1 minute per centimeter of BE detected more patients with endoscopically suspicious lesions (54.2% vs 13.3%, P = .04), and there was a trend toward a higher detection rate of HGD/EAC (40.2% vs 6.7%, P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Post hoc analysis of an enriched study population and experienced endoscopists at tertiary referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Longer time spent inspecting the BE segment is associated with the increased detection of HGD/EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Taking additional time to perform a thorough examination of the BE mucosa may serve as an easy and widely available method to improve the yield of BE surveillance </plain></SENT>
