<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are associated with high rates of complete eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, if ablation were to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in the regenerated squamous epithelium, then postablation biopsies may not penetrate deeply enough to detect subsquamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SSIM) and, therefore, complete response rates could be over-estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GOALS: To assess the depth of esophageal biopsies from the squamous epithelium of ablation-naive controls and from the neosquamous epithelium of post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and post-RFA patients to determine if prior ablation results in a reduced proportion of biopsies containing lamina propria (LP) as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY: Review of archived esophageal specimens from a prospective multicenter cohort study (post-RFA) and 2 retrospective consecutive case series (ablation-naive controls, post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Eight US centers and 1 US gastrointestinal pathology laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Ablation-naive controls with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e>, and/or BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and post-RFA BE patients with biopsies more than 6 months after achieving complete eradication of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Review of endoscopic biopsies from ablation-naive controls, post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> patients, and post-RFA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: One GI pathology lab processed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissue and slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One expert GI pathologist, blinded to cohort, graded the depth of each esophageal specimen as: partial epithelium, full epithelium, LP, muscularis mucosae, or submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Each specimen was also evaluated for SSIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 82 patients [ablation-naive (12), post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> (10), post-RFA (60)] with 899 biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The proportion of specimens containing "LP or deeper" was similar between groups: ablation-naive (88%), post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> (88%), post-RFA (91%) (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No SSIM was detected in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in esophageal biopsy depth between ablation-naive squamous epithelium and post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>/post-RFA neo-squamous epithelium, thus refuting the concern of ablation-induced mucosal resistance to procurement of adequate biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most biopsies (88% to 91%) from both ablation cohorts were deep enough to detect SSIM, in that they included "LP or deeper." </plain></SENT>
