<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability (MSI) has been reported in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> as the prototype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about MSI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE)-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the clinicopathologic and molecular features of BE-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> with and without MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study cohort consisted of 76 patients with BE-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (66 male, 10 female), with a mean age of 65.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and CD3 and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MLH1 and PMS2 expression was lost by IHC in 5 cases (6.6%); of these, 5 showed high-level MSI (MSI-H) by polymerase chain reaction assay, and 4 showed hMLH1 promoter methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with MSI-H were heterogenous and included conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating lymphocytes (n=1), medullary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (n=2), signet ring cells (n=1), and signet ring cell and mucinous components (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> negative for MSI by IHC, BE-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> with MSI-H were associated with older patient age (P=0.0060), lymphovascular invasion (P=0.027), and significantly larger numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating lymphocytes (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no statistical difference in overall survival between the 2 groups (P=0.285) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MSI-H is uncommon in BE-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, but is associated with clinicopathologic features fairly similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> microsatellite unstable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the growing evidence that indicates lack of benefits from adjuvant therapy with fluorouracil in the colonic counterpart, it may be important to identify MSI-H in BE-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
