<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> occurs as an intermediate step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> without the demonstration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of dual-parameter flow cytometry (FC) as a predictor of neoplastic risk in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-free cases was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA/protein FC and histology were performed on 362 samples from 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-free BE patients, followed up since 1985 once every 1-2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine cases were aneuploid, five of which (group IV) were frankly aneuploid; in the other four cases (group III), <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was detectable by dual-parameter analysis only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients were diploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve (group II) also had an abnormally high G1-phase protein content compared to group I (nine patients), which were diploid with a low-moderate protein content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three patients of group IV an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in situ was diagnosed, after 5, 6, and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two patients of group III, a low- and a high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were observed at 3 and 6 years follow-up, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient of group I first acquired a high protein content, then an aneuploid DNA content, and then progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the still diploid patients (17 cases) have progressed to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> compared with 6 of 13 presently aneuploid patients (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, DNA/protein FC is a marker of increased malignant potential and thus may be used to detect patients at higher risk in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-free BE and assist in understanding the various stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in long-term follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
