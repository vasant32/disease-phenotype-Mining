<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> are defined and classified by measuring their length during endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the accuracy of length measurement of esophageal lesions with the conventional gastroscope marked at 5-cm intervals, and the secondary aim was to test the performance of a modified gastroscope marked at 1-cm intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 24 senior endoscopists carried out endoscopy on a plastic mannequin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The esophagus was randomly replaced by one of a set of seven plastic tubes, each tube having two colored rings which were 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 or 4 cm apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endoscopists were asked to measure the distance between the mouth-guard and each of the two "esophageal" rings during endoscope withdrawal, with a precision of 0.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants endoscoped <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven tubes blindly, first using the conventional scope and then the modified scope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using the conventional gastroscope, measurements were overall incorrect in 67.9 % (95 % CI 61 - 75.1) of cases and incorrect by at least 1 cm in 21 % (95 % CI 14.8 - 27.2) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These percentages were significantly reduced by using the modified gastroscope (47.6 %, 95 % CI 40.1 - 55.2 and 7.1 %, 95 % CI 3.2 - 11.0, respectively) ( P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall accuracies in measuring lengths of &gt;or= 2 cm and &gt;or= 3 cm, corresponding to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> definitions, were 83 % and 94 % - 95 % with the conventional and modified gastroscopes, respectively ( P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that estimation of the length of esophageal lesions using conventional endoscopes is inaccurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of measurements is significantly improved with the use of an endoscope marked at intervals of 1 cm </plain></SENT>
