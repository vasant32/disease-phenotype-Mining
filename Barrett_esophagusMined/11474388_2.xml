<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Esophageal disease</z:e> research is impeded by a paucity of nonmalignant cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, culture of primary esophageal cells is difficult because of a lack of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a short-term culture method to facilitate cell physiologic studies by using primary esophageal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By using a cytology brush, squamous and Barrett's epithelial cells were obtained from the esophagus of patients undergoing upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells were brushed onto chamber slides and allowed to adhere to the surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary culture media was then added and cells were maintained at 37 degrees C for up to 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell yield and viability were calculated after trypan blue staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For cell physiologic studies, cells were loaded with pH-sensitive dye BCECF-AM and intracellular pH measured on a dual excitation fluorescence microscope after an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">ammonium chloride</z:chebi> prepulse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of the physiologic experiments, cells were fixed in <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi> and the cell type was verified with cytokeratin immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Viable human esophageal cells were maintained in culture for up to 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cells extruded trypan blue, and BCECF-AM was cleaved to BCECF by an intact cell membrane and permitted intracellular pH measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The epithelial cell origin of the cells was confirmed by cytokeratin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no contamination over the culture period and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> by lymphocytes or fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This novel adaptation of brush cytology technique enables short-term culture of esophageal cells for in vitro studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This rapid, simple primary culture technique is suitable for endoscopy and does not require the immediate, time-consuming laboratory techniques </plain></SENT>
