<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are currently 2 existing confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) platforms: probe-based CLE (pCLE) and endoscope-based CLE (eCLE) systems, each with its own criteria for identifying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic performance of these 2 systems has not been directly compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Preclinical, feasibility study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We compared the interrater agreement and diagnostic performance of the pCLE and eCLE systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated a new BE endomicroscopy criteria based on fluorescent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> intensity uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> undergoing 16 EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: CLE imaging was performed using two different probes with 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diaxol-4-yl)amino]-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi>, a fluorescent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> analog with preferential uptake in dysplastic mucosa to supply contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four quadrants were imaged per specimen with a total of 64 imaged mucosal sites presented to three gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Interobserver agreement and accuracy for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was assessed of images classified according to Miami criteria, stacked eCLE images classified using the Mainz criteria and a novel fluorescence intensity criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The interrater agreements were 0.17, 0.68, and 0.87 for the Miami, Mainz, and the fluorescence intensity criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall accuracy in detecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 37% (95% CI, 30.3-43.9), 44.3% (95% CI, 37.3-50.9), and 78.6% (95% CI, 72.2-83.3) for the Miami, Mainz, and the fluorescence intensity criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This imaging technique and proposed fluorescence intensity criteria using 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diaxol-4-yl)amino]-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> in EMR tissue will require in vivo validation and cannot be directly used with the current eCLE and pCLE clinical applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this preclinical feasibility study, the use of an eCLE system with a topical fluorescent contrast in ex vivo EMR tissue demonstrated higher interrater agreement and accuracy </plain></SENT>
