<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic assessment of the length and area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has become crucial in assessing its spontaneous course as well as any effect of pharmacological or endoscopic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little, however, is known about the extent to which the endoscopic assessment of BE length and area correlates with the histopathological confirmation of BE epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 75 consecutive patients (mean age 60 years; 58 men, 17 women) were included in a prospective study on the basis of the endoscopic suspicion of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BE was endoscopically defined as gastric-type epithelium between the proximal cardiac folds and the Z line, on moderate air insufflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stepwise four-quadrant biopsies (4QB) were then taken, beginning at the proximal cardiac folds and then every 2 cm up to the Z line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 75 study patients, BE was histologically verified in 57 cases (group 1) and not confirmed in any of the endoscopic biopsy samples in 18 cases (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 1, the mean difference between the endoscopic and histological assessment of BE length was + 1 cm (range 0 - 5 cm); when determining the BE area histologically from 4QB the mean difference to the endoscopic determination was + 36 % (range 0 - 93 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences were independent of the presence and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> or the presence of long or short BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of patients, there is only a moderate correlation between the endoscopic and the histological extent of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, we also found a substantial individual variability in endoscopic-histological correlation; therefore studies on the effects of treatment on BE must consider both the endoscopic and histopathological BE lengths </plain></SENT>
