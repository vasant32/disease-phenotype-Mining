<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Protein p53 is the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor involved in cell cycle control and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are several polymorphisms reported for p53 which can affect important regions involved in protein <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amongst the polymorphisms described, R213R and 13949 g--&gt;a are rarely studied, with an estimate frequency not yet available for the Brazilian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the genotype and allele frequencies and associations of these polymorphisms in a group of patients with altered esophageal tissue from South Brazil and compare with the frequency observed for a control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 35 patients for R213R and 45 for 13494 g--&gt;a polymorphisms analysis with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) symptoms diagnosed by upper digestive endoscopy and confirmed by biopsy were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For both groups, 100 controls were used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was also analyzed for a selected group of patients where <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and affected tissue was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) showing LOH for R213R out of two heterozygous samples analyzed and two patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and BE) for 13494 g--&gt;a polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also aimed to build a haplotype for both polymorphisms collectively analyzed with R27P polymorphism, previously reported by our group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in allele and genotype distribution between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although using <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the cardia and BE samples, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-neoplastic lesions, we can conclude that these sites do not represent genetic susceptibility markers for the development and early progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> to BE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are required in order to investigate other determiners of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> known to predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
