<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are associated with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-EAC relation is mediated by factors secreted from adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin is a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> secreted by adipocytes, and its plasma levels are inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to estimate the effect of circulating adiponectin on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), an accepted precursor of EAC, controlling for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms and other potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a case-control study in cases of BE compared with controls without BE; most controls had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR), corresponding to associations with BE, were estimated from conditional and unconditional logistic regression analyses of 50 matched pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE was inversely associated with plasma adiponectin level (OR for each 10-microg/mL decrement 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-15.0) and positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> duration &gt;or=10 yr, male gender, tobacco smoking, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> duration, tobacco use, and BMI increased the adiponectin-BE association (OR 6.4, 95% CI 1.1-37.0), but the estimated OR was reduced when adjusting for measures of abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (e.g., OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.49-13.00) and further adjusting for gender (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.66-4.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite methodologic limitations, including the small sample size, our findings suggest that adiponectin may be involved in the etiology of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rather than simply a mechanical effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> promoting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, the effects of abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on the risk of BE might be mediated by adiponectin and other circulating factors </plain></SENT>
