<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Beta-galactosidase activity at pH 6 is associated in vitro with senescence and cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, but in vivo data are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study undertook firstly to map 'senescence-associated' beta-galactosidase activity (SAbetaG) at pH 6 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelia and mucosae of the upper gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As escape from senescence confers a proliferative advantage, a reduction in SAbetaG activity might be predicted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and their precursors in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This prediction was tested in metaplastic, dysplastic, and neoplastic epithelium of the upper gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histochemical staining for SAbetaG was performed at pH 6 on cryostat sections of 350 endoscopic biopsies from sites including oesophagus, stomach, and duodenum of 46 patients: 28 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (two with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>), 15 with <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and three with oesophageal squamous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A staining score (range 0-6) was assigned to epithelial cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mucosae and scores were calculated for surface (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi>), intermediate, and deep (basal) layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The strongest SAbetaG activity was in surface <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> duodenal mucosa (mean score 3.6+/-0.5; n=19), 'specialized' Barrett's mucosa (mean 2.2+/-0.12; n=105), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the stomach (mean 2.4+/-0.40; n=16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Squamous epithelium was consistently negative for SAbetaG activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low- and high-grade Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed no decrease in SAbetaG activity, but reduced activity was seen in gastric and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (mean 1.24+/-0.29; n=17; p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In six <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, there was no detectable activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether SAbetaG is truly a marker of cellular senescence in vivo remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Activity is low in mucosal proliferation compartments and increases with cellular differentiation, especially in native or metaplastic intestinal mucosae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SAbetaG activity persists in dysplastic mucosae but may show some reduction or loss in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (p=0.0012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Loss of SAbetaG activity is not, therefore, an early event in <z:mp ids='MP_0002163'>glandular dysplasia</z:mp>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of the upper gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
