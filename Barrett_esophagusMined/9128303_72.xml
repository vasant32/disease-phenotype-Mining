<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the impact of esophageal acid control on the symptoms of reflux disease, healing of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, change in length of Barrett's epithelium, and the appearance of squamous islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen of 27 patients on 60 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> underwent ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring while on therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were recorded, and the length of Barrett's epithelium was measured, photographed, and biopsied every 6 months over an average of 5.7 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight of 13 patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 24 h pH (group I, mean pH &lt; 4, 0.8%), five patients had abnormal results (group II, mean pH &lt; 4, 10.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptoms improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and there was complete healing of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase in the number of squamous islands was noted in 62.5% of patients in group I and in 80% of patients in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean length of Barrett's epithelium at baseline and study completion in group I was 5.6 and 5.0 cm, respectively (mean decrease, 0.6 cm), and for group II was 4.2 and 4.2 cm, respectively (mean decrease, 0 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the change in length between the two groups (p = 0.494) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although symptoms improved, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> healed, and squamous islands increased, there was no significant decrease in the length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Control of esophageal pH alone is not sufficient for the reversal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
