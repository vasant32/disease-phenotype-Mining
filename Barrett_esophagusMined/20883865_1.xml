<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These techniques may be more challenging in patients with previous antireflux surgery, because of poor visibility and accessibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the results of endoscopic resection for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> complicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> after antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case series, retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single tertiary-care referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved 7 patients treated for Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> by endoscopic resection between 2001 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Endoscopic resection was performed by using the EMR cap technique or by endoscopic submucosal dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The curative resection rate, complications, follow-up, and complete remission status were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients underwent endoscopic resection (mean number of sessions, 3.1; range, 1-6): endoscopic submucosal dissection in 3 patients and EMR in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients needed additional <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pathology examination disclosed invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 3 patients and high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the last follow-up examination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Major procedure-related complications were not encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Small number of patients, single center, retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that full endoscopic resection by using EMR or endoscopic submucosal dissection in patients with previous antireflux surgery can be achieved successfully and safely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These patients can be treated endoscopically, similarly to patients without previous surgery </plain></SENT>
