<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> may represent a group of patients with poorer postoperative outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that such patients should undergo open rather than laparoscopic antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: The laparoscopic approach to antireflux surgery is appropriate treatment for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> who have symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The outcome of 757 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1998, was prospectively examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> was present in 81 (10.7%) of these patients (58 men and 23 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome for this group of patients was compared with that of patients undergoing surgery who did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The types of operation performed were similar for the 2 patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- SD length of columnar mucosa was 47.4 +/- 43.6 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average +/- SD operation time was 79.0 +/- 33.4 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversion to open surgery occurred in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative outcomes were as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH studies before and after laparoscopic fundoplication demonstrated a significant increase in lower esophageal sphincter resting and residual relaxation pressures and a significant decrease in distal esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four patients have developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> within 4 years of their antireflux surgery, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these have subsequently undergone esophageal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of laparoscopic antireflux surgery is similar for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> compared with other patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This suggests that laparoscopic surgery is appropriate treatment for this patient group </plain></SENT>
