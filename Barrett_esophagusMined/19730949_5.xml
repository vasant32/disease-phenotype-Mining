<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes one of the earliest and largest North American experiences with this device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective data were gathered on consecutive patients undergoing EsophyX fundoplication for a 1-year period between September 2007 and March 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During this time, the procedure evolved to the current technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study enrolled 26 patients with a mean age of 45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients included 16 women (62%) with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 28 and an American Society Anesthesiology (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) classification of 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients included 11 with associated small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo>, 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and 5 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal dysmotility</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The procedure time was 65 min (range, 29-137 min), and the length of hospital stay was 1 day (range, 0-6 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The postoperative valve circumference was 217 degrees, and the valve length was 2.7 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two complications of postoperative bleed occurred, requiring transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Comparison of pre- and postoperative Anvari scores (34-17; P = 0.002) and Velanovich scores (22-10; P = 0.0007) showed significant decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although 68% of the patients were still taking antireflux medications, 21% had reduced their dose by half </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three patients had persistent symptoms requiring Nissen fundoplication, and there was one late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> unrelated to the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study represents an initial single-institution experience with EsophyX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>According to the findings, 53% of the patients had either discontinued their antireflux medication (32%) or had decreased their dose by half (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Both symptoms and health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) scores significantly improved after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Further follow-up evaluation and objective testing are required </plain></SENT>
