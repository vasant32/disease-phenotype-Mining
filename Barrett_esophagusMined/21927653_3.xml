<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) has been greatly debated over the past decades, with the importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> first being overemphasized and then later being nearly neglected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is now understood that both the anatomical (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>) and the physiological (lower esophageal sphincter) features of the gastroesophageal junction play important, but independent, roles in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, constituting the widely accepted "two-sphincter hypothesis." The gastroesophageal junction is an anatomically complex area with an inherent antireflux barrier function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the gastroesophageal junction becomes incompetent and esophageal acid clearance is compromised in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, which facilitates the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> (types I, II, III, and IV), type I (sliding) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> are closely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> may lead to reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, a better understanding of this association is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernias</z:hpo> can be diagnosed radiographically, endoscopically or manometrically, with each modality having its own limitations, especially in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> less than 2 cm in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the future, high resolution manometry should be a promising method for accurately assessing the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> is similar to the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and should be reserved for those with symptoms attributable to this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgery should be considered for those patients with refractory symptoms and for those who develop complications, such as recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, ulcerations or strictures </plain></SENT>
