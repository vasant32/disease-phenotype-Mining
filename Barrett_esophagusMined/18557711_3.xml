<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study to determine the proportion of BE from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for various indications at an outpatient, community-based gastroenterology practice in northern California from February 2000 to September 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BE was defined as endoscopically recognized presence of salmon-pink mucosa in the distal esophagus and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also performed a nested case-control study to determine potential predictors of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 5,293 patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BE was more common in non-Asians (31/1464, 2.1%) than Asians (29/3829, 0.76%) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis controlling for increasing age, male gender, ethnicity, smoking, and alcohol, the strongest predictor of the presence of BE was non-Asian ethnicity (odds ratio [OR] 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.85-6.85), followed by male gender (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.32-5.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BE is uncommon in Asian Americans; non-Asian ethnicity and male gender are significant independent predictors of BE </plain></SENT>
