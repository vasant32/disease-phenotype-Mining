<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this procedure in the proximal gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: forty one consecutive patients (23 males and 18 females, mean age of 61 Â± 11.5 years) were included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty nine resections were performed in these patients in 69 sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions treated consisted of elevated lesions with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (group A), high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> appearing in random biopsies taken during the follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (group B) and superficial gastroduodenal lesions (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Snare resection after submucosal injection, band ligator-assisted or cap-assisted mucosal resection were the chosen techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: we resected 7 elevated lesions with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 6 complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 16 sequential sessions and 46 gastroduodenal superficial lesions (10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, 9 gastric superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and 9 lesions of different histological nature) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Resections in the two first groups were complete in 100% of the cases, and in 97.9% of the cases in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications included 2 cases of limited deferred <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (groups A and B) and another two cases of stenosis with little clinical relevance in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: a) endoscopic mucosal resection is an efficient technique for the treatment of proximal gastrointestinal tract superficial lesions; b) it is a safe procedure with a low percentage of complications, which can generally be managed endoscopically; and c) in contrast with other ablative techniques, endoscopic mucosal resection offers the possibility of a pathologic analysis of the samples </plain></SENT>
