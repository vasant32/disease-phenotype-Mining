<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In some patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> presents with heartburn and regurgitation symptoms but a relative paucity of endoscopic and clinical findings, while in others symptoms may be minor or absent yet there is significant mucosal damage on endoscopy including the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial injury of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> is to the squamous esophageal mucosa, but while substantial research has been devoted to determining which genes are involved in the progression of Barrett's to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, little is known about the gene expression alterations in the squamous mucosa of patients with reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) might be increased in the squamous esophageal mucosal of patients with reflux, and might be a molecular indicator of reflux injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, we hypothesized that Cox-2 expression in the squamous mucosa would be reduced following the elimination of reflux with an antireflux operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsies of the distal esophageal squamous mucosa were taken 3 cm above the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) in 28 GERD patients before and after Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following microdissection and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolation, quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure Cox-2 gene expression in paraffin-embedded (N = 16) and fresh frozen (N = 12) tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsies from patients (paraffin N = 15, frozen N = 14) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> acid exposure and no evidence of mucosal injury were analyzed as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median Cox-2 expression in the squamous epithelium from paraffin embedded biopsies in patients with reflux disease was significantly increased compared to controls (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> did not significantly alter the expression of Cox-2 compared to patients with nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After antireflux surgery median Cox-2 expression values were significantly reduced (p = 0.0003) and were normalized to levels similar to controls without reflux (p = 0.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed in the prospectively obtained fresh frozen tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cox-2 gene expression is increased in the distal esophageal squamous mucosa of most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, and the elevation was similar whether there was mucosal injury in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or Barrett's or no visible mucosal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that increased Cox-2 expression may serve as a molecular marker of reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The increased Cox-2 expression in patients with reflux was usually normalized following antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate for the first time that gene expression can be altered by surgical correction of reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, in addition to symptom control and improvement in the quality of life, perhaps future studies assessing the efficacy of antireflux therapy should also focus on the impact of the therapy on gene expression in the esophageal squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
