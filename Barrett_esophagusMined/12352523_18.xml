<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are virtually no published longitudinal outcome studies that describe the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> GER throughout a person's lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of recalled childhood reflux symptoms in adult patients currently with and without GER symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred adult patients were classified as refluxers (225 patients; 57%), nonrefluxers (154 patients; 38%), and those who claimed to not know if they had reflux (21 patients; 5%; excluded from analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were given a questionnaire asking them to recall childhood symptoms attributed to GER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 225 refluxers, 141 (63%) recalled at least one childhood symptom, compared with 54 of the 154 nonrefluxers (35%) ( &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adult refluxers were more likely to recall having developed GER symptoms at an earlier age, beginning at infancy and developing statistically significant GER compared with nonrefluxers after age 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adults suffering from GER were far more likely than nonrefluxers to recall having experienced GER symptoms during childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Well-designed, population-based epidemiologic studies are needed to more accurately assess the extent of GER in the overall population and the extent of its impact on health care in the United States </plain></SENT>
