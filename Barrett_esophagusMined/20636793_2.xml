<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A secondary aim was to study clinical outcome of IND cases and to evaluate expression of alpha-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-CoA racemase (AMACR) as a marker predictive of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> over a 20 year period were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three experienced histopathologists reviewed 101 cases on set criteria in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slides were immunostained for AMACR and evaluated for the presence, extent and location of AMACR expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and progression data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall agreement for the diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was fair (k = 0.35) but that for IND was poor (k = 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>6 IND cases progressed after a median follow-up of 31.4 months to a higher grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of AMACR for the detection of abnormality was 22% for IND and specificity 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of AMACR for progression was 0.44 and the negative predictive value was 0.92 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fair agreement was achieved for the diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> but poor agreement for IND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A proportion of IND cases progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Re-diagnosis or consensus diagnosis did not predict progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AMACR shows promise as a marker to indicate IND patients in need of more intensive surveillance </plain></SENT>
