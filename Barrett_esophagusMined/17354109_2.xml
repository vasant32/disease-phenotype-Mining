<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to create models estimating the BO population fitting each of these three hypotheses, in order to select the most plausible hypothesis and to gain insight into the Danish BO population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Models were designed for these three hypotheses, conforming to the generally accepted 0.4-0.5% annual ACO incidence in BO patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These models employed expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms, Danish life tables and the observed ACO incidence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The models enabled the estimation of a BO population for each hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After testing against set criteria, the most plausible model was found to be that describing a birth cohort effect which predicted a +/-5% annual rise in the prevalence of BO and, consequently, in the incidence rate of ACO in Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This prediction was borne out over the subsequent decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This rising ACO incidence rate is likely to continue into the foreseeable future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of EM algorithms enabled a first estimate of the BO population at risk of ACO, although, owing to the limitations imposed by the models, the age- and gender-specific ACO risk for the entire Danish BO population could not as yet be ascertained </plain></SENT>
