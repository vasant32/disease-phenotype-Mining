<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy at a community-based, BE referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After symptom evaluation, endoscopy and histologic assessment, esophageal motility, pH monitoring on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>, computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasonography and mucosal resection for nodules, we performed HALO(360) ablation followed by twice daily <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> and 3-monthly surveillance for up to 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were present at follow-up, the patients received a second ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (12 male) were treated, three with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, four with low-grade and six with non-dysplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean baseline BE length was 6 cm (range 2-12); nine patients had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and two had a prior fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Esophageal pH &lt; 4.0 for &lt; 4% of time was achieved only in 5/13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A mean of 1.4 ablation sessions were performed, without serious adverse events or strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete eradication of BE was achieved in 6/13 (46%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean endoscopic surface regression was 84% (from a mean length of 6 +/- 1 cm to 1.2 +/- 0.5 cm, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete elimination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was achieved in 5/7 (71%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ablation efficacy was better in those patients who had maximal pH control (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HALO(360) ablation of BE with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is safe, well-tolerated and effective in the community setting </plain></SENT>
