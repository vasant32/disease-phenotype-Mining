<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is commonly practiced to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in an early and curable stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the cost-effectiveness of this practice has been questioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify this issue, we undertook a cost analysis of endoscopic surveillance to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> compared with mammography used to detect occult <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the breast, a widely accepted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveillance technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rate of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> detected by endoscopic surveillance was calculated for Duluth Clinic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> seen from 1980 to 1995 and compared with published rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> detection was calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women undergoing surveillance mammography at the Duluth Clinic for the year 1994 and compared with published rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Costs for screening studies and therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were calculated based on clinical results and assumptions regarding outcomes derived from published reports, and the costs were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopic surveillance of 149 patients with benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was performed for a total of 510 patient-yr, during which time seven patients developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, an incidence of one case per 73 patient-yr of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> was detected in 50 of 12,537 mammograms, a detection rate of 0.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidences in both cases were comparable to published figures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The costs of detecting a case of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> were $37,928 and $54,513, respectively, and those for treatment resulting in cure were $83,340 and $83,292 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cost per life-yr saved was $4,151 for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and $57,926 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endoscopic surveillance of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> compares favorably with the common practice of surveillance mammography to detect early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, and should therefore be considered to be as cost-effective as surveillance mammography </plain></SENT>
