<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methionine synthase (MTR) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> ss-synthase (CBS) are enzymes that play a central role in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism, thereby affecting DNA methylation and synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single A--&gt;G substitution at nucleotide 2756 of the MTR and a 68 bp CBS insertion polymorphism in exon 8 have been associated with decreased enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to compare the association of the MTR A2756G polymorphism and CBS insertion polymorphism with susceptibility to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the upper gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-PCR, the prevalence of MTR A2756G and CBS insertion polymorphism was determined in healthy controls (n = 257) and in patients with esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) (n = 263), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>-associated esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BC) (n = 89), cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (CC) (n = 144), or gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (GC) (n = 221) from German Caucasian subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference in MTR A2756G genotype distribution was observed between controls (A/A 66.9%, A/G 29.8%, G/G 3.3%) and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> (A/A 61.7%, A/G 36.3%, G/G 2.1%), BC (A/A 69.2%, A/G 26.9%, G/G 3.9%), CC (A/A 51.8%, A/G 44.6%, G/G 3.6%), or GC (A/A 73.4%, A/G 20.9%, G/G 5.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the CBS genotype (I: allele with 68 bp insertion; N: allele without insertion) distribution among German patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> (N/N 86.8%, I/N 13.2%), BC (N/N 90.2%, I/N 9.8%), CC (N/N 90.1%, I/N 9.9%) or GC (N/N 91.3%, I/N 8.7%) was not different from healthy controls (N/N 90.4%, I/N 9.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gene allele constellation I/I was not present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that there is no association between MTR A2756G polymorphism and the CBS (844ins68) insertion polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of the upper gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
