<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Characterisation of the underlying molecular mechanisms that promote Barrett's progression may ultimately lead to identification of potential predictive genetic markers that classify patients' malignant risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to understand these causative pathways, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was used in this study to determine when specific genetic alterations arise during Barrett's associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic cytology brushings were obtained from 28 patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, 28 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (20 low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) and eight with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD)), and seven with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, together with paired control brushings from regions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proximal squamous cell epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The exfoliated epithelial cells were washed and deposited onto slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probes specific for the centromeres of chromosomes 4, 8, 20, and Y, and locus specific probes for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor genes p16, p53, and Rb were subsequently hybridised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>Aneuploidy</z:mp> was found early in progression, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_605'>metaplastic tissues</z:mpath> displaying increased copy numbers of chromosomes 4 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 4 hyperploidy was found in 89%, 90%, 88%, and 100% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasias</z:mpath>, LGD, HGD, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, respectively, while chromosome 8 hyperploidy occurred in 71%, 75%, 100%, and 100% of patients with the respective staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss of the p16 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor gene also presented in metaplastic epithelium (7%) but most other genetic aberrations were only seen in HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic instability arises well before <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, with chromosome 4 and 8 hyperploidy representing the earliest and most common alterations identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As these aberrations are widespread at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the premalignant stages, there may be genes on chromosomes 4 and 8 that are involved in both the initiation and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
