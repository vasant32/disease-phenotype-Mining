<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Increased waist circumference and visceral fat are associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This association might be mediated by mechanical and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the distribution of fat in subjects with BE and its association with <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected data from 50 BE cases and 50 controls (matched for age and sex, identified from a radiology trauma database) seen at the Mayo Clinic in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abdominal (subcutaneous and visceral) and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) fat area was measured using computed tomography with standard techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>Esophageal inflammation</z:mp> (based on a histologic score) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> grade were assessed from esophageal biopsies of BE cases by a gastrointestinal pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the association of body fat depot area with BE status, <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BE subjects had controlled reflux symptoms without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, based on endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The GEJ fat area (odds ratio [OR], 6.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-27.7; P = .02), visceral fat area (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.0-22.8; P = .04), and abdominal circumference (OR, 9.1; 95% CI, 1.4-57.2; P = 0.02) were associated with BE, independent of body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The subcutaneous fat area was not associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Visceral and GEJ fat were significantly greater in BE subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> (compared with those without, P = .02) and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (compared with those without, P = .01), independent of BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GEJ and visceral fat are associated with BE, and with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE subjects, independent of BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Visceral fat therefore might promote esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
