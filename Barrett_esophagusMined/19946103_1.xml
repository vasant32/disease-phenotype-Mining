<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression profiles of MUC1 and MUC4 were investigated by immunohistochemistry in tissue samples obtained from consecutive patients with primary surgically resected lower third oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) between 1997 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histopathological parameters, recurrence and long-term survival were correlated with the number of cells stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 52 patients exhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, with 25 patients (48.1%) having associated Barrett oesophagus lesions (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or/and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MUC1 and MUC4 were expressed in 52 and 41 of the 52 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (100% and 78%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples expressed MUC1 strongly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MUC4 staining was significantly decreased in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (53% versus 92%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the level of MUC1 or MUC4 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> and histopathological variables, recurrence or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MUC1 and MUC4 are strongly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results do not support a role for these two membrane-bound mucins as either a phenotypic or a prognostic marker for the development of Barrett <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There are several other membrane-bound mucins that have not yet been evaluated in this situation </plain></SENT>
