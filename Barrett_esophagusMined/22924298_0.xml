<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both, surveillance and therapeutic strategies have been proposed over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent deve-lopment of endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) brought new perspectives in the treatment of BE, with excellent initial results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study of 40 pts with macroscopically visible BE on endoscopy and biopsy proven goblet cells presence, was conducted from January 2010 until March 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pts a complete symptomatic, endoscopic and manometric evaluation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initially RFA HALO 90 and 360 were performed in 28 and 12 pts respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Repeated treatments were conducted in 7 pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall number was 50, while the mean number of RFA procedures per patient was 1.25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean circumferential length and maximal extent of BE were 1.61 and 3.29 cm respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did not encounter esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications were transient short-term retrosternal pain (23 pts) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (11 pts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three months after the RFA mean values of cumulative symptom and heartburn score dropped significantly (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Functional diagnostics did not disclose any statistically significant decrease of lower esophageal sphincter pressure or esophageal body contraction amplitudes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One year foIlow-up was obtained in 26 pts and revealed a complete macroscopically visible BE eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>So far, in 19 pts a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was performed up to 3 months after complete RFA BE eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HALO RFA procedure is safe and very effective in the treatment of pts with BE, does not lead to esophageal function impairment, and produces no long term and serious side effects </plain></SENT>
