<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine by immunohistochemistry and amplification of cDNA the relationship between fibroblast growth factor (FGF) expression and progressive changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> associated with oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FGFs are potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> that possess angiogenic properties and the capability to regulate growth and differentiation of various cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They have also been implicated in the development and progression of numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e>, including some <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the aerodigestive tract, such as nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006725'>pancreatic adenocarcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND RESULTS: We studied the expression of the two prototypic FGFs, acidic FGF (FGF-1) and basic FGF (FGF-2), in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> precursor lesions, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fresh tissue from 10 OAs and four associated HGDs was available for the determination of FGF-1 and FGF-2 mRNA expression accomplished by the PCR amplification of cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemistry, we studied the expression of the FGF-1 and FGF-2 proteins in archival, paraffin-embedded tissue that was available from 17 oesophageal resection specimens that included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OAs</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> precursor lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As compared to gastric fundic mucosal controls, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OAs</z:e> and HGDs showed significantly enhanced expression of FGF-1 mRNA and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IMs and LGDs showed significantly lesser degrees of FGF-1 immunoreactivity that were not increased over controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both the overall percentage of FGF-2-reactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OAs</z:e> and the overall FGF-2 protein expression, assessed using an immunoreactivity score, are comparable to FGF-2 expression in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It appears that FGF-2 is ubiquitously expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal and gastric mucosa while significant FGF-1 expression is essentially restricted to HGD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data also suggest that FGF-1 is sequentially upregulated in the progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
