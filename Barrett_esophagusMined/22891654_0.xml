<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential role of HPV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has been examined but remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HPV in esophageal and gastric tissues obtained from patients with and without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We designed a cross-sectional study was conducted with prospective enrollment of eligible patients scheduled for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants had biopsies of endoscopic BE, squamous-lined esophagus, and stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue was conducted using monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HPV was performed on DNA extracted from esophageal biopsies snapped frozen within 30 minutes after endoscopic capture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Roche HPV Linear Array Assay with PGMY primers that has high sensitivity for detecting 37 types of HPV was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 127 subjects were included: 39 with definitive BE had IHC done on samples from non-dysplastic BE, squamous esophagus, gastric cardia, and gastric body; and 88 control patients without BE had IHC done on squamous esophageal samples, gastric cardia, and gastric body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HPV was not detected in any of the samples in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For confirmation, HPV DNA PCR was performed on randomly selected samples from 66 patients (both esophagus and BE from 13 patients with BE, and 53 esophagus from patients without BE); no sample had HPV DNA detected via PCR in the presence of adequate quality control </plain></SENT>
