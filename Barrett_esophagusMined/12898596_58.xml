<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate Raman spectroscopy, a rapid, non-invasive, molecular, specific analytical technique, for the objective identification and classification of Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A secondary objective was to demonstrate the need for a rigorous gold standard in the development of new diagnostic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients with a mean age of 69 years (range 34-89 years) undergoing surveillance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three consultant pathologists independently assessed snap-frozen oesophageal biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Raman spectra were measured on 87 histopathologically homogeneous samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spectral classification models were developed using multivariate analysis for the prediction of pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathology and Raman classification results were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Raman spectral prediction with a consensus pathology classification model gave sensitivities between 73% and 100% and specificities of 90-100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high level of agreement (kappa = 0.89) was demonstrated between the three-subset biopsy targeting model and consensus pathology opinion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This compares favourably with the agreement measured between an independent pathologist and the consensus pathology opinion for the same spectra (kappa = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Raman spectroscopy appears to provide a highly sensitive and specific technique for the identification and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
