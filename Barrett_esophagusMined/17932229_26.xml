<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a specialized columnar epithelium (SCE) that develops as replacement for damaged squamous epithelium (SqE) in subjects with reflux disease, and as such it is apparently more acid resistant than SqE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>How SCE resists acid injury is poorly understood; one means may involve altered tight junctions (TJs) since the TJ in SqE is an early target of attack and damage by acid in reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess this possibility, quantitative RT-PCR for 21 claudins was performed on endoscopic biopsies on SCE of BE and from healthy SqE from subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SCE, Cldn-18 was the most highly expressed at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level and this finding is paralleled by marked elevation in protein expression on immunoblots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast in SqE, Cldn-18 was minimally expressed at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level and undetectable at the protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence studies showed membrane localization of Cldn-18 and colocalization with the tight junction protein, zonula occludens-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When Cldn-18 was overexpressed in MDCK II cells and mounted as monolayers in Ussing chambers, it raised electrical resistance and, as shown by lower dilution potentials to a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> gradient and lower diffusion potentials to acidic gradients, selectively reduced paracellular permeability to both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi> compared with parental MDCK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Cldn-18 is the dominant claudin in the TJ of SCE and propose that the change from a Cldn-18-deficient TJ in SqE to a Cldn-18-rich TJ in SCE contributes to the greater acid resistance of BE </plain></SENT>
