<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Understanding the molecular and cellular processes underlying the development, maintenance, and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) presents an empirical challenge because there are no simple animal models and standard 2D cell culture can distort cellular processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture system to study BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BE cell lines (CP-A, CP-B, CP-C, and CP-D) and esophageal squamous keratinocytes (EPC2) were cultured on a matrix consisting of esophageal fibroblasts and collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of growth and cytokeratin expression in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="63" ids="17883">hydrochloric acid</z:chebi> was made by immunohistochemistry and Alcian Blue staining to determine which treatments produced a BE phenotype of columnar cytokeratin expression in 3D culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> differentially affected the growth of BE cell lines in 3D culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, the non-dyplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-derived cell line (CP-A) expressed reduced squamous cytokeratins and enhanced columnar cytokeratins upon ATRA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ATRA altered the EPC2 squamous cytokeratin profile towards a more columnar expression pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell lines derived from patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> already expressed columnar cytokeratins and therefore did not show a systematic shift toward a more columnar phenotype with ATRA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ATRA treatment, however, did reduce the squamoid-like multilayer stratification observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the first study to demonstrate long-term 3D growth of BE cell lines, we have determined that BE cells can be cultured for at least 3 weeks on a fibroblast/collagen matrix and that the use of ATRA causes a general reduction in squamous-like multilayered growth and an increase in columnar phenotype with the specific effects cell-line dependent </plain></SENT>
