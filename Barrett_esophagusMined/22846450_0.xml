<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the current situation regarding diagnosis, epidemiology, management and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in East Asian countries using a questionnaire-based survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Representative members of the Committee of the International Gastrointestinal Consensus Symposium developed and sent a questionnaire to major institutions in China, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 56 institutions in the 6 countries participated in the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the presence of specialized columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is considered to be important for diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in East Asian countries except for Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C&amp;M criteria have not been well accepted in East Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The palisade vessels are mainly used as a landmark for the esophagogastric junction in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is extremely low in East Asia, while the prevalence of short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is very high only in Japan, likely due to different diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among East Asian countries, we found both similarities and differences regarding diagnosis and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings in the present survey are helpful to understand the current situation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in East Asian countries </plain></SENT>
