<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of its poor prognosis, management of this disease through screening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BE) patients and identification of those with a high risk of developing an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> seems a promising approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early molecular markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> might contribute to such screening approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene promoter methylation analysis was performed on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, pre-neoplastic, and neoplastic lesions from BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions of interest were sampled by microdissection from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that, in 27 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, APC, TIMP3, TERT, CDKN2A, and SFRP1 promoters were methylated in 93%, 65%, 64%, 48%, and 91%, respectively; in contrast MLH1, RASSF1, RARB, CDH1, and FHIT promoters were methylated in less than 5% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In BE mucosa from patients who had progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (12 samples), APC, TIMP3, and TERT promoters were hypermethylated in 100%, 91%, and 92% of cases, whereas in BE mucosa from patients who had not progressed (16 samples) methylation was found only in 36%, 23%, and 17%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the epigenetic profile of BE with and without EAC differed significantly with, respectively, 81% and 26% of the PCR samples showing promoter hypermethylation for APC, TIMP3, and TERT (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Promoter methylation of CDKN2A was infrequently detected in BE samples, while SFRP1 methylation was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that promoter methylation profiling of BE using multiple target genes including APC, TIMP3, and TERT might be used as a predictive marker for increased EAC risk </plain></SENT>
