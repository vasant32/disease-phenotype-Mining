<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus develops from metaplastic Barrett's columnar epithelia through the evolution of dysplastic epithelial intermediates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is well established, far less is known regarding the cellular changes involved in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is characterized by the loss of apical secretory specializations, we hypothesized that changes in apical trafficking might be involved in the dysplastic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have sought to evaluate the expression of an important candidate regulator of apical trafficking, the small <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-binding protein, Rab11, in resection and biopsy tissue from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sections from esophageal resection specimens from 4 patients and endoscopic biopsies from 60 patients were stained with antibodies against Rab11 and Rab25 as well as protein markers of the Golgi apparatus and p53 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rab11 staining in low-grade dysplastic regions was similar to that observed with monoclonal antibodies against Rab25 and gamma-adaptin and colocalized with staining for the Golgi marker, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17369">mannose-6-phosphate</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> resections, prominent Rab11 immunostaining was observed in the supranuclear region of low-grade dysplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, regions of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> demonstrating strong nuclear p53 staining showed only diffuse or absent Rab11 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In endoscopic biopsies, 91% of biopsies that were read unanimously as low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> demonstrated supranuclear Rab11 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen percent of biopsies unanimously graded as being without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> demonstrated perinuclear Rab11 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No p53 immunostaining was observed in any of the low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An increase in Rab11 immunoreactivity seems to correlate with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, whereas p53 immunostaining correlates with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The colocalization of Rab11 staining with increased immunoreactivity for markers of the trans-Golgi system is consistent with a defect in apical trafficking due to an expansion of either the trans-Golgi compartment or the apical recycling vesicle system </plain></SENT>
