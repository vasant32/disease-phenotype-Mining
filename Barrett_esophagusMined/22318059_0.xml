<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Evidence is increasingly convincing that lung transplantation is a risk factor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still not known if the type of lung transplant (unilateral, bilateral, or retransplant) plays a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: The records of 61 lung transplant patients who underwent esophageal function tests between September 2008 and May 2010, were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were divided into 3 groups based on the type of lung transplant they received: unilateral (n=25); bilateral (n=30), and retransplant (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these groups we compared: (1) the demographic characteristics (eg, sex, age, race, and body mass index); (2) the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>delayed gastric emptying</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>; and (3) the esophageal manometric and pH-metric profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Distal and proximal reflux were more prevalent in patients with bilateral transplant or retransplant and less prevalent in patients after unilateral transplant, regardless of the cause of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and the manometric profile were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although our data show a discrepancy in prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in patients with different types of lung transplantation, we cannot determine the exact cause for these findings from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the extent of dissection during the transplant places the patients at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the results of this study, a higher level of suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> should be held in patients after bilateral or retransplantation </plain></SENT>
