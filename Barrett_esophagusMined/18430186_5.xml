<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BE patients endoscopically treated for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (EC) or high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) in a lesion or mass between 1998 and 2005 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy and histology records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four patients (78 males, mean age 67 years, 24 HGIN, 70 EC) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 36 (38%) patients, HGIN/EC was diagnosed at (or within 6 months after) initial endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 58 (62%) patients had a surveillance history (median duration 7 years, mean 6.7 endoscopies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine percent of these had low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (LGIN) diagnosed at least once during their surveillance period with a median of seven endoscopies and a median number of biopsies that was 50% of what should have been taken according to the Seattle protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients without any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> during earlier surveillance (n = 12, 21%) had undergone significantly less endoscopies (median four endoscopies, P = 0.02) and had a median biopsy percentage that was 23% of the Seattle protocol (P &lt; 0.001 versus 50% in LGIN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this selected cohort of patients with early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, 38% of patients were diagnosed at initial endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with a surveillance history, 79% had shown LGIN prior to HGIN/EC diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 21% of patients had a surveillance history without any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, which in general encompassed endoscopies with an insufficient number of biopsies, suggesting sampling error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This underlines the importance of obtaining an adequate number of biopsies during surveillance endoscopies </plain></SENT>
