<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aims: To determine quality indicators, frequencies into the registry of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies in a tertiary academic hospital in Mexico City </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Material and methods: A retrospective, observational and transversal study was performed in the Specialty Hospital Dr. Antonio Fraga Mouret IMSS between July 2007 and June 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Registry of several quality indicators for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: A total of 485 endoscopic reports were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reason for upper endoscopy was as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> 161, <z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>esophageal dilation</z:mp> 133, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcer</z:hpo> 82, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> 120, and upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> 130 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The indicators evaluated were: Informed consent 91.3%, complete examination 97.7%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> measured and biopsy specimens taken 85.7% y 96.2% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were taken in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcer</z:hpo> 87.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Description and localization of upper gastrointestinal lesion 99.2%, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> haemostatic treatment 98.2%, and haemostasis documented 94.6%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> were recommended to patients undergone <z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>esophageal dilation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> 80.3% y 29.2% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Registry frequencies of quality indicators were high for upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo>, completeness of examination and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological treatment recommendation in peptic disease is an area that has to be improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was not possible to establish either the indicator or only its register was omitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Key words: Quality indicators, endoscopy, registries, gastroscopy, consent forms, Mexico </plain></SENT>
