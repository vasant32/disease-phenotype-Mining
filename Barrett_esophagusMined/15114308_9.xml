<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic measurements are frequently used to determine the length of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decreases in measured length also are used to assess response to pharmacotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of the endoscopic measurement of length under standardized conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A life-size model of the esophagus was built by using an opaque polyvinyl tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transparent plastic inserts designed to resemble Barrett's epithelium were created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten different insert lengths were randomly studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trained endoscopists and fellows in training blinded to the lengths of the inserts performed measurements twice in random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 240 measurements were made by 12 endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean difference (1 standard deviation) between the measured and correct length was 1.10 (1.7) cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overestimation of the length occurred in 47% and underestimation in 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The kappa statistic for the first and second measurement (within 0.5 cm) performed by the same individual (intra-observer) was 0.40, suggesting only fair agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was considerable variability between endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Accurate measurement of length at endoscopy is difficult even under ideal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intra-observer agreement is fair, but results obtained by different endoscopists are widely divergent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Small improvements in the length of Barrett's epithelium observed in some clinical trials could be because of chance instead of therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
