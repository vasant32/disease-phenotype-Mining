<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Optimal management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> complicated by high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the extent of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was described as a predictor of subsequent development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in patients undergoing continued surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is no universal agreement on the definition of extent of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aim: To determine if extent of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is a predictor of the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at the time of oesophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> who underwent oesophagectomy between 1985 and 1999 were identified from a prospective database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pathological specimens, including preoperative endoscopic biopsies and post-oesophagectomy sections, were reviewed in a blinded fashion by one expert gastrointestinal pathologist to determine the extent of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was defined using two different criteria, one from the Cleveland Clinic and one from the Mayo Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty four of 42 patients (57%) had unsuspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at the time of oesophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using the Cleveland Clinic definition, 10 of 21 (48%) patients with focal high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> compared with 14 of 21 patients (67%) with diffuse high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (p=0.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using the Mayo Clinic definition, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was found in five of seven (72%) patients with focal high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> compared with 19 of 35 (54%) with diffuse high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (p=0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The extent of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, regardless of how it is defined, does not predict the presence of unsuspected <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at oesophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence as yet that the extent of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> can be used as a basis for decision making in these patients </plain></SENT>
