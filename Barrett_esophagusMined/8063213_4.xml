<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epithelial cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were isolated from resected oesophagus specimens by two methods not previously applied to the culture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These techniques included trypsinisation of small fragments of mucosa, followed by plating in tissue culture dishes, and a direct tissue explant technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A modified MCDB-153 growth medium was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary trypsin technique cultures were plated on uncoated plastic, or plastic coated with type I collagen, type IV collagen, or fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Growth on type IV collagen and fibronectin plates was slower but produced less contamination from fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By 20-40 days most cultures formed confluent monolayers made up of cells with epithelial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cells were cytokeratin positive, vimentin negative, and contained alcian blue positive vacuoles, confirming their epithelial origin and suggesting their derivation from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy showed tonofilaments, microvilli, and desmosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cells proliferated through up to eight subcultures before growth slowed and cells showed senescent changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study shows that epithelial cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> can be grown by comparatively simple tissue culture techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These methods can provide sufficient material for a variety of molecular biology and biochemical studies of epithelial cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
