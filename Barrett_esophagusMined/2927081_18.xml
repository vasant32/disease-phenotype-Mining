<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior ultrastructural studies have suggested that Barrett's epithelium is a mucous secretory epithelium that shares some morphologic features with the intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The origin and development of Barrett's epithelium and the cellular abnormalities accompanying its <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to better understand the histogenesis of the mucus-producing cells that predominate in Barrett's epithelium, these cells were studied by transmission electron microscopy and compared with other upper gastrointestinal epithelia: esophageal glands, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric surface, pit, and cardiac gland regions, gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> jejunal villous tip and crypt regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 134 mucosal biopsies from the stomach and esophagus of 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and 37 biopsies from 14 other control patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Barrett's specialized metaplastic surface cells display a spectrum of ultrastructural features among three main surface columnar epithelial cell types: mucous cells resembling those seen in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric surface epithelium or resembling mucous neck cells normally seen in the gastric pits; goblet cells similar to those seen in the jejunum; and "pseudoabsorptive" cells with features of both gastric mucous secretory cells and jejunal absorptive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic organelles of Barrett's specialized metaplastic, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucous neck, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric surface mucous epithelial cells, including rough endoplasmic reticulum, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> aggregates, Golgi apparatus, and mucous secretory granules, have common ultrastructural features associated with mucus synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The morphologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of Barrett's specialized metaplastic cells and common ultrastructural features associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucus biosynthesis suggest that they develop from a gastrointestinal stem cell that retains the capacity for a wide range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal differentiation in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The identity of this undifferentiated cell, which may reside in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proximal gastric or esophageal mucosa, remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the gastric mucous neck cell has properties that suggest it could be the progenitor cell for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> because it is a stem cell that has ultrastructural similarities to Barrett's specialized metaplastic epithelial cells and it is located in intact gastric mucosa adjacent to where <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> forms </plain></SENT>
