<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a new device allowing for the diagnosis and treatment of extended superficial lesions of the esophagus and hypopharynx such as early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new modified rigid esophagoscope (Karl Storz GmbH, Germany) has been designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large mucosal area is sucked against a transparent and perforated hemi-cylindrical window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mucosal resection is performed by an electrical wire loop at a constant depth of 1 +/- 0.1 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resected surface varies from 4 to 12 cm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circumferential resection consists of two opposite individual hemi-circumferential resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed three series of animal trials: hemicircumferential mucosectomies; circumferential resections of variable (2 to 6 cm) length and long-segment mucosectomies with follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemi- and circumferential resections could be done in one or two specimens only which allowed precise histological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This facilitated easy orientation and analysis of the surgical margins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The deep resection margin was precisely located at the submucosal level, a prerequisite for a safe resection of superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0152018" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers of the esophagus</z:e> and hypopharynx </plain></SENT>
