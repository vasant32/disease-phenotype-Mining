<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the ratio of esophageal complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and the relationship between reflux symptoms and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six hundred forty-five consecutive adult patients presenting to the Reflux Outpatient Clinic were evaluated prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and who complained of heartburn or regurgitation occurring at least weekly were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The complaints and general features of patients were queried via a detailed questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (17%) had endoscopic evidence of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> was found in 3 patients (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> nor <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>Esophagitis</z:hpo> was low grade (grades A and B) in 25 of the 27 (92%) with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> consumed less alcohol than patients with non-erosive reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference was found between the severity of symptoms in patients with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and non-erosive reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were less common compared to the literature although the study was conducted in a tertiary reference center for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of severe symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> is not an indication for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No impact of Helicobacter pylori on the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or symptoms was shown </plain></SENT>
