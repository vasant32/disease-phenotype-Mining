<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare single-layered hand-sewn cervical end-to-side (ETS) anastomosis with end-to-end (ETE) anastomosis in a prospective randomized fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The preferred organ used for reconstruction after esophagectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies attempted to define the optimal site of anastomosis and anastomotic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, anastomotic stricture formation and leakage still remain an important clinical problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From May 2005 to September 2007, 128 patients (64 in each group) were randomized between ETE and ETS anastomosis after esophagectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with gastric tube reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Routine contrast swallow studies and endoscopy were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic stricture within 1 year, requiring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, was the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were anastomotic leak rate and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-nine men and 29 women underwent esophagectomy and gastric tube reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Benign stenosis of the anastomosis, for which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was required, occurred more often in the ETE group (40% vs. ETS 18%, P &lt; 0.01) after 1 year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall (clinical and radiological) anastomotic leak rate was lower in the ETE group (22% vs. ETS 41%, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with an ETE anastomosis suffered less often from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>; 17% versus ETS 44%, P = 0.002 and had subsequently significantly shorter in-hospital stay (15 days vs. 22 days, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality did not differ between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ETS anastomosis is associated with a lower anastomotic stricture rate, compared to ETE anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, prevention of stricture formation was at high costs with increased anastomotic leakage and longer in-hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study is registered with the Dutch Trial Registry and carries the ID number OND1317772 </plain></SENT>
