<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, expression levels for EGF receptor, erbB2 and erbB3 in specialized columnar epithelium (SCE) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between EGF family receptors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, we examined expression levels for EGF receptor, erbB2 and erbB3 in SCE of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 10 consecutive patients with short- and long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and 10 control subjects without organic esophago-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric diseases</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples of Barrett's mucosa stained or not stained with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> applied endoscopically were used for histological evaluation and Western blot analysis of EGF receptor, erbB2 and erbB3 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was 2.6 cm (range 1-8 cm) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissue samples from <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> stained Barrett's mucosa consisted of non-dysplastic SCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the Barrett's group, Western blot analysis showed that EGF receptor and erbB2 were equally and strongly expressed in SCE and squamous epithelium; in contrast, erbB3 expression in SCE was considerably weaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In control subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> proteins showed strong expression for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of SCE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> showed positive EGF receptor and erbB2 expression, and no erbB3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ErbB2 is strongly expressed in both non-dysplastic SCE and squamous epithelium, whereas erbB3 expression is essentially limited to the squamous epithelium.  </plain></SENT>
