<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent morphologic and molecular evidence suggests that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) begins in the bases of the crypts [crypt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (CD)] and progresses with time to involve the upper portions of the crypts and surface epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the criteria and reproducibility of diagnosing CD among 6 gastrointestinal pathologists, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with research interest in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six gastrointestinal pathologists evaluated 2 clinical study sets, the first consisting of 40 BE cases [BE: 10, CD: 9, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD): 10, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD); 9, and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; 2] and the second consisting of 63 cases (BE: 16, CD: 15, LGD: 15, HGD: 15, and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>: 2), at least 4 months apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In between evaluations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the pathologists met at 1 hospital (consensus conference) to review the areas of disagreement and establish more objective criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, the level of agreement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases was moderate (κ=0.44), and the level of agreement did not change significantly after evaluation of the second study set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest levels of agreement were obtained for lesions at the low and high end of the spectrum (BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the degree of agreement for CD was moderate after both the first and second study set review (κ=0.44 and 0.46, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the degree of agreement for CD was higher than that obtained for LGD in both study sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the first study set, 4 or more pathologists agreed with the original CD diagnosis in 78% of cases, and this value did not change significantly after review of the second study set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observers agreed that characteristic features of CD include the presence of unequivocal dysplastic cells, similar in appearance to traditional LGD, involving any part, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the length, of the crypt in the absence of intercrypt surface epithelial involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rare cases of CD may show high-grade cytologic features composed of markedly enlarged nuclei with increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, eosinophilic cytoplasm, irregular nuclear membranes, and loss of polarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings in this study suggest that CD can be diagnosed reliably with a moderate level of interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term and multi-institutional studies should be carried out to further determine the biological and clinical significance and natural history of CD in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
