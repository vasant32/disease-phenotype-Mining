<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For diagnostic purposes it is important to find biomarkers that can specifically identify BE, for instance to differentiate BE epithelial cells from gastric cardia epithelial cells in brush cytology specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the specificity of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 and a set of cytokeratins (CKs) as specific markers for BE as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal and gastric cardia tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with specific antibodies against <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2, and a set of CKs was performed on fresh frozen consecutive tissue sections of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous, gastric cardia and non-dysplastic BE of 80 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IHC results showed CK8, CK18 and CK20 expression in both BE and gastric cardia, while CK7 was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BE but also in 26% of gastric cardia biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CK10/13 was only expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 nuclear staining was found in 87.5% of the BE biopsies, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus and cardia biopsies were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 in combination with a set of CKs can be used as biomarkers to distinguish between BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In order to distinguish BE from cardia tissue, a combination of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 and CK7 is most informative </plain></SENT>
