<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Population-based data on the epidemiology and outcomes of subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the gastroesophageal junction (IMGEJ) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to (i) estimate the incidence of IMGEJ and BE diagnosed from clinically indicated endoscopy in Olmsted County, MN, over three decades (1976-2006) and prevalence as of 1 January 2007, (ii) compare baseline characteristics of subjects with IMGEJ and BE, and (iii) study the natural history and survival of both cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study setting was Olmsted County, MN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE (columnar segment &gt;1â€‰cm with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) and IMGEJ (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in biopsies from the gastroesophageal junction) from 1976 to 2006 in Olmsted County, MN, were identified using Rochester Epidemiology Project resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical records and pathology confirmed by gastrointestinal pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of baseline characteristics with overall and progression-free survival was assessed using proportional hazards regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were baseline characteristics and overall survival of subjects with IMGEJ compared to those with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 487 patients (401 with BE and 86 with IMGEJ) were identified and followed for a median interval of 7 (BE subjects) to 8 (IMGEJ subjects) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subjects with BE were older, heavier, reported reflux symptoms more often, and had higher prevalence of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> than those with IMGEJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient with IMGEJ progressed to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) in contrast to BE subjects who had a cumulative risk of progression of 7% at 10 years and increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from EAC (standardized mortality ratio 9.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall survival of subjects with BE and IMGEJ did not differ from that expected in similar age- and sex-distributed white Minnesota populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with IMGEJ appear to have distinct clinical characteristics and substantially lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> risk compared to those with BE </plain></SENT>
