<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 50 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>-associated esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), 50 cardiac <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and 50 gastric <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> were investigated by means of methylation-specific real-time PCR for hypermethylation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes APC, p16(INk4A) and p14(ARF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, expression of p16(INK4A) protein in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> was assessed using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marked differences in hypermethylation were found between esophageal, cardiac and gastric <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> in the APC gene (78% vs. 32% vs. 84%) and in the p16(INK4A) gene (54% vs. 36% vs. 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of p14(ARF) was absent from esophageal <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and present infrequently in cardiac (2%) and gastric <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete loss of p16(INK4A) protein expression was detectable in 45% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and was significantly associated with hypermethylation of the p16(INK4A) gene (p&lt;0.0001, chi(2)-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that hypermethylation of p16(INK4A) and APC are frequent findings in esophageal, cardiac and gastric <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the data point to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specific methylation pattern in upper gastrointestinal <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
