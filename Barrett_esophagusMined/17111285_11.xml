<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is considered the main etiologic process in the metaplastic development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most serious complication of BE is the possible dysplastic evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many treatments have been described to prevent the progression of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of these interventions are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether laparoscopic fundoplication for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> had an impact on the development of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective data were collected from patients who were treated with a laparoscopic fundoplication for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data was collected and analyzed for a variety of clinical and pathologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Laparoscopic fundoplications were completed between 1993 and 2001, with a total sample size of 92 (mean age 53 +/- 11.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each patient was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> associated with BE confirmed by both endoscopy and biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A laparoscopic fundoplication was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (360 degree fundoplication in 81 patients and partial fundoplication in 11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no postoperative mortality or major complications from the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean postoperative stay was 3 +/- 1 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients (76% of the overall sample size) were followed up for a mean 4.2 +/- 2.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the patients available for follow-up, 33% (n = 23) had a complete regression of their BE; 21% (n = 15) had a decrease in the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; 39% (n = 27) had no significant change; and 7% (n = 5) experienced a progression of the BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five patients required further procedures for three reasons: (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> recurrence (n = 2), (2) progression of BE (n = 2), and (3) intrathoracic migration (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No patients developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that laparoscopic fundoplication offers a safe and effective long-term treatment for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The procedure also demonstrated regression of BE in more than 50% of the sample size </plain></SENT>
