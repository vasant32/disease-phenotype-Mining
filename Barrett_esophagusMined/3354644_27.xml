<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry for the analysis of nuclear DNA content and cell cycle parameters has also been postulated to be an objective aid in the diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the relationship among sulfated mucin, flow cytometric data, and histologic diagnosis in each of 152 biopsies from 42 patients who had Barrett's specialized metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sulfated mucin, as detected by the high iron <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15571,23666">diamine</z:chebi>-Alcian blue stain, was present in biopsies from 8 of 11 (73%) patients with the histologic diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, in 7 of 9 (78%) patients whose biopsies were indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and in 12 of 22 (55%) patients whose biopsies were negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P = 0.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sulfated mucins predominated in 9%, 22%, and 9% of the patients, respectively (P = 0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal flow cytometry (<z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> or increased G2/tetraploid fraction) was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with the histologic diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, in 3 of 9 (33%) indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and in 1 of 22 (5%) negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P = less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither the presence nor the predominance of sulfated mucin in the specialized metaplastic epithelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has sufficiently high sensitivity or specificity for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> to be of value in managing patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormal flow cytometry shows excellent correlation with the histologic diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; it detects a subset of patients whose biopsies are histologically indefinite or negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, but who have flow cytometric abnormalities similar to those otherwise seen only in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
