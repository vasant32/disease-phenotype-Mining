<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to test the diagnostic variability and correlation with patient outcome and to attempt to define histological features causing discrepant diagnoses, as well as to test the impact of adding p53 immunohistochemistry on reproducibility and prediction of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and forty-three patients with 154 sets of biopsy specimens originally diagnosed with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were retrieved from the pathology records of Nottingham University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two Barrett's patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anonymized slides were graded independently by five pathologists without and with p53-stained slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interobserver variation, correlation with outcome and diagnostic accuracy were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Weighted kappa scores between pairs of pathologists showed substantial agreement and improved after p53 immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Agreement with the original diagnosis was substantially lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 34 low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> (LGD) and 27 of 30 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> on consensus progressed within 10 years compared with 18/94 and 28/39 of original diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progression correlated with p53 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Vienna classification is useful and reproducible in BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consensus diagnosis by gastrointestinal pathologists produces high specificity and predictive value, even for LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>p53 immunohistochemistry assists in diagnosis in difficult cases and predicts progression </plain></SENT>
