<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of patients who have either not responded at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or partially and inadequately responded to such therapy requires a more detailed history and may involve an endoscopy and esophageal biopsies, followed by esophageal manometry, ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring, and gastric emptying scanning </plain></SENT>
