<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since accurate diagnosis of LGIN is difficult, general pathologists are frequently uncertain about the diagnosis of LGIN and its follow-up risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyse the divergence between the diagnoses of general and specialized gastrointestinal pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients with a previous diagnosis of LGIN in BE, made by a general pathologist, were included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histopathological slides of every patient were reassessed in a blinded fashion by two specialized gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inter-observer variability was calculated using kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LGIN was confirmed by specialized pathologists in only 25/50 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (42%) had Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> without intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and in 4 patients (8%) HGIN or Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (BC) was revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inter-observer agreement between the general and specialized pathologists for the diagnosis of LGIN was poor (kappa = - 0.17) and good between both of the specialized pathologists (kappa = 0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with HGIN/BC were treated by endoscopic resection or surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with LGIN, ablative therapy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete response was achieved in 25 patients, but 3 patients developed HGIN and 1 patient developed BC after 10+/-3.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BE with LGIN is difficult to diagnose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Inter-observer variability is unacceptable between general and specialized pathologists and therefore when diagnosing LGIN a second opinion should always be sought by a specialized GI pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ablation therapy seems to be effective in patients with LGIN, but follow-up endoscopies are necessary to detect metachronous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
