<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The treatment of choice was transhiatal radical subtotal oesophagectomy (n = 38); in three patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the mid or upper thoracic portion of the oesophagus, right transthoracic en bloc oesophagectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient died within 30 days and another within 90 days (4.8 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were resected completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multicentricity of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was detected in six cases and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some 31 patients had infiltration of the submucosa, whereas in ten, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was limited to the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient with mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e>, whereas five of the 31 with submucosal infiltration showed lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate of the total group of 41 patients, including postoperative mortality, was 83 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ten patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> limited to the mucosa (pT1a) were alive at 5 years; of 31 with submucosal infiltration (pT1b) 79 per cent survived to 5 years (P not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients without lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> had a 5-year survival rate of 81 per cent, compared with 50 per cent for those in the pN1 category (P not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oesophagectomy for early oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is safe and leads to a favourable long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
