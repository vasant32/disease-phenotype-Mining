<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was also recently found to be expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> spheres prepared from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, suggesting that it will likely serve as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cell marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine Lgr5 as a biomarker in BE-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using standard immunohistochemistry, we performed immunostaining on 81 esophageal specimens (53 biopsy specimens and 28 surgical resections) representing BE, BE-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each immunostain was scored based on intensity of immunostaining and percentage of positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For 24 EAC cases, survival analysis was performed with expression scores and other clinicopathological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that Lgr5 expression was detected in 70% of BE cases and between 90 and 100% of advanced dysplastic lesions and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intensity of expression was significantly higher in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EAC than BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In EAC, high Lgr5 expression scores (&gt; or = 5) were associated with worse survival, independent of stage, age, and neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that Lgr5 has potential utility as a biomarker for BE-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EAC </plain></SENT>
