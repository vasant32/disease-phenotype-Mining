<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle proteins have been advocated as biomarkers to predict the malignant potential in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether disruption of the cell cycle plays a causal role in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens from the Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence were immunostained for cell cycle phase markers (cyclin D1 for G1; cyclin A for S, G2, and M; cytoplasmic cyclin B1 for G2; and phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> 3 for M phase) and expressed as a proportion of proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle phase of prospective biopsies was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proliferation status of nondysplastic BE was similar to gastric antrum and D2, but the proliferative compartment extended to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In dysplastic samples, the number of proliferating cells correlated with the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall levels of cyclins A and B1 correlated with the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the cell cycle phase distribution measured with both immunostaining and flow cytometry was conserved during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of BE, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, the increased proliferation seen in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> is due to <z:mp ids='MP_0003077'>abnormal cell cycle</z:mp> entry or exit, rather than a primary abnormality within the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
