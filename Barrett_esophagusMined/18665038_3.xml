<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and one cases of BE diagnosed by esophageal biopsy and resections were examined morphologically for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These were categorized as BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n=25), indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (IND, n=17), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD, n=18), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD, n=15), and AdenoCa (n=26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for p16 (INK4A/CDKN2A), Cyclin D1 (CCND1), Ki-67, and alpha-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25271">methylacyl-CoA</z:chebi> racemase (AMACR) was employed to assess their potential as diagnostic discriminators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal p16 expression (negative, cytoplasmic, or combined cytoplasmic and nuclear staining) was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> categories, rising from 68% in BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to 100% in AdenoCa, with cytoplasmic staining only showing a significant correlation with the severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 expression was present in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, but high expression (&gt;50% cells positive) was displayed mostly in HGD and AdenoCa (46.7% and 42.3%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 index increased with the severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and labeling extended from the lower third of the crypts to the superficial epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of AMACR-positivity was 12% in BE, 47.1% in IND, 44.4% in LGD, 93.3% in HGD, and 96.2% in AdenoCa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intensity and extent of AMACR staining also increased with the severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aberrant p16 and high-cyclin D1 expression may reflect early genetic events during the progression of Barrett-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic staining of p16 is specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may represent a different pathway of p16 dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pattern and extent of Ki-67 staining and AMACR overexpression are useful additional parameters for identifying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE </plain></SENT>
