<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The practice patterns of endoscopists since the publication of more recent management guidelines remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> endoscopists (n=68) in the Irish Medical Directory and their trainees were sent a postal questionnaire on Barrett's surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five per cent (30/54) perform surveillance on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and 38% on selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, repeat endoscopy was more commonly practiced annually (28/54) than every two to three years (23/54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgeons were more likely to perform surveillance annually than gastroenterologists (75% vs 40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 26% of endoscopists took four-quadrant biopsies every 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intervention was recommended by a majority (28/54) of endoscopists in a patient with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A majority of respondents (47/54) would have surveillance if they were found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical endoscopists perform surveillance more frequently than their medical colleagues </plain></SENT>
