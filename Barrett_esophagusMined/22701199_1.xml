<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is the only known precursor of EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE have a greater than 40 folds higher risk of EAC compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent years have witnessed a revolution in the clinical and molecular research related to BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, several aspects of this condition remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data regarding the true prevalence of BE have varied widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested a lower incidence of EAC in nondysplastic BE (NDBE) than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is paucity of prospective data showing a survival benefit of screening or surveillance for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the ever-increasing emphasis on healthcare cost containment has called for reexamination of the screening and surveillance strategies for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is a need for identification of reliable clinical predictors or molecular biomarkers to risk-stratify patients who might benefit the most from screening or surveillance for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, new therapies have emerged for the management of dysplastic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we highlight the key areas of controversy and uncertainty surrounding BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The paper discusses, in detail, the current literature about the molecular pathogenesis, biomarkers, histopathological diagnosis, and management strategies for BE </plain></SENT>
