<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to determine whether the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> preoperatively influences the clinical outcome after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred thirty-one patients who underwent a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication were classified into three groups according <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 59 had no evidence of endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (group 1), 148 had uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (group 2), and 24 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative clinical assessment of heartburn, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, and patient satisfaction using visual analogue scales was performed by an independent investigator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the groups in regard to their clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is a suitable approach for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with objectively proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> selected for surgery, irrespective of their preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> grade </plain></SENT>
