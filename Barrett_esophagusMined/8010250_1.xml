<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: I report a subtle finding of columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> examination that to my knowledge has not been described before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The finding is a focal mural deformity associated with fixed transverse folds and minimal limitation of distensibility of the esophagus at least 4 cm proximal to the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The abnormality was seen in four patients who had air-contrast upper gastrointestinal <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> studies for evaluation of various gastrointestinal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one had symptoms referable to the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was suggested on the basis of the findings on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> studies and was confirmed by endoscopic biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial radiographs showed subtle contour defects in the esophageal wall at least 4 cm proximal to the esophagogastric junction in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These appeared as focal indentations (two cases) or a gradual concavity (two cases) in the wall that could be mistaken for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> extrinsic impression or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiographs obtained with increased distension or in different degrees of obliquity showed fixed transverse folds suggestive of submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was observed at endoscopy, but no endoscopic findings correlated with the focal changes seen on radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Identification of focal defects in the esophageal contour at least 4 cm proximal to the esophagogastric junction on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> studies raises the possibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is further suggested if repeat radiographs obtained with increased distension and different degrees of obliquity show fixed transverse folds, limited distensibility of the esophageal wall, or both </plain></SENT>
