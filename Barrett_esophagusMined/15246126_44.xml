<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Patients were recruited at 1,253 centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following an assessment of medical history, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were endoscoped and received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> for 2 to 8 weeks before entering the 5-year observational phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 6,215 patients (53% male, age 54+/-14) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 46% reported at least daily symptoms, 15% were unable to work at least once during the prior year, and 71% had visited a physician due to reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) was found in 11% of our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In polychotomous regression analysis, the main factors related to the occurrence of the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> subgroups (nonerosive, erosive disease, and BE) were age, gender, duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and previous <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with longer disease duration were increasing age, male gender, BMI, increasing symptom severity, presence of erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> or BE, positive family history, and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is a great burden for patients, and has significant socioeconomic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The long-term follow-up period with further endoscopic and histologic evaluations, will help further our understanding of the natural course of the disease </plain></SENT>
