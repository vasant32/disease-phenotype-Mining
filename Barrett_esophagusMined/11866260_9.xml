<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Normalization of esophageal acid exposure had been assumed to be necessary for the reversal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This assumption is examined by evaluating the esophageal pH in a group of patients undergoing reversal therapy with fixed high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy and endoscopic multipolar electrocoagulation (MPEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of 2-6 cm in length were treated with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (40 mg b.i.d.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They underwent 24-h esophageal pH monitoring 5 cm above the upper margin of the lower esophageal sphincter determined by a water-perfused catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They then underwent MPEC therapy to an endpoint of elimination of Barrett's (reversal) by both endoscopy and biopsy 6 months after the last MPEC session or failure to achieve visual (endoscopic) reversal after six treatment sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients had 24-h pH testing and reached a reversal endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients had abnormal pH tests, two total and supine and one supine only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients had documented reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 17 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pH testing but five failed reversal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> can be completely reversed with endoscopic therapy despite abnormal esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, patients can fail reversal even with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The necessary reduction of esophageal acid exposure for reversal therapy has yet to be defined </plain></SENT>
