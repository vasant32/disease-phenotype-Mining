<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate sensations to multimodal pain stimulation in the metaplastic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parts of the esophagus in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with BE and 15 age-matched healthy volunteers were subjected to mechanical, thermal and electrical pain stimuli of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both the metaplastic part and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> part (4 and 14 cm, respectively, above the esophago-gastric junction) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At sensory thresholds the stimulation intensity, referred pain areas, and evoked brain potentials were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were hyposensitive to heat stimulation both in the metaplastic part [median stimulation time to reach the pain detection threshold: 15 (12-34) s vs 14 (6-23) s in controls; F = 4.5, P = 0.04] and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> part of the esophagus [median 17 (6-32) s vs 13 (8-20) s in controls; F = 6.2, P = 0.02] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients were hyposensitive in the metaplastic part of the esophagus to mechanical distension [median volume at moderate pain: 50 (20-50) mL vs 33 (13-50) mL in controls; F = 5.7, P = 0.02] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No indication of central <z:mp ids='MP_0000768'>nervous system abnormalities</z:mp> was present, as responses were comparable between groups to electrical pain stimuli in the metaplastic part [median current evoking moderate pain: 13 (6-26) mA vs 12 (9-24) mA in controls; F = 0.1, P = 0.7], and in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> part of the esophagus [median current evoking moderate pain: 9 (6-16) mA, vs 11 (5-11) mA in controls; F = 3.4, P = 0.07] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no differences were seen for the referred pain areas (P-values <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> &gt; 0.3) or latencies and amplitudes for the evoked brain potentials (P-values <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> &gt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with BE are hyposensitive both in the metaplastic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> part of esophagus likely as a result of abnormalities affecting peripheral nerve pathways </plain></SENT>
