<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that extracellular acid exposure causes intracellular acidification that triggers MAPK signaling and proliferation in Barrett's epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested that hypothesis in a Barrett's-derived esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line (SEG-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SEG-1 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of acid, and intracellular pH (pH(i)) was measured by 2',7'-bis-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50329">2-carboxyethyl</z:chebi>)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein microfluorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After acid exposure, ERK and p38 MAPK activation were measured by Western blot analysis and an immune complex kinase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proliferation was measured by Coulter counter cell counts and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi> incorporation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure of SEG-1 cells to solutions with a pH between 3 and 6.5 caused a rapid, reversible decrease in pH(i) to a level approximately equal to extracellular pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Acid exposure caused a rapid activation of both ERK and p38 MAPKs and also resulted in pH-dependent increases in cell number, with a maximum increase of 41% observed at pH 6.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MAPK activation and proliferation in SEG-1 cells induced by acid exposure could be blocked by pretreatment with disodium 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbine-2,2'-disulfonate (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4286">DIDS</z:chebi>), which prevents intracellular acidification by inhibiting the Cl(-)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17544">HCO(3)(-)</z:chebi> exchanger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in SEG-1 cells, extracellular acid exposure causes intracellular acidification, which activates MAPK and causes proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of these effects is pH dependent, and the effects can be inhibited by preventing intracellular acidification with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4286">DIDS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
