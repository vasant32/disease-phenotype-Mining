<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The currently recommended regimen for focal radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) comprises 2 applications of energy, cleaning of the device and ablation zone, and 2 additional applications of energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A simplified regimen may be of clinical utility if it is faster, easier, and equally safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of 2 focal RFA regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Three tertiary referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Consecutive patients scheduled for focal RFA of BE with flat type BE with at least 2 BE islands or mosaic groups of islands were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: BE areas were paired: 1 area was randomized to the "standard" regimen (2 × 15 J/cm(2)-clean-2 × 15 J/cm(2)) or to the "simplified" regimen (3 × 15 J/cm(2)-no clean), allocating the second area automatically to the other regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of surface area regression of each area was scored at 2 months by the endoscopist (blinded) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of completely removed BE areas at 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Calculated sample size was 46 pairs of BE areas using a noninferiority design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Noninferiority was defined as &lt;20% difference in the paired proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five equivalent pairs of BE areas were included in 41 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proportion of completely removed BE areas at 2 months after focal RFA was 30 (67%) for standard and 33 (73%) for simplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Noninferiority was demonstrated by a 7% difference (95% CI, -10.6 to +20.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Tertiary referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this multicenter randomized trial suggest that a simplified 3 × 15 J/cm(2) focal ablation regimen is not inferior to the standard regimen, regarding the endoscopic removal of residual Barrett islands </plain></SENT>
