<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence supports severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Successful antireflux surgery leads to stabilization and possibly regression of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's epithelium, and can be followed by squamous epithelial regeneration in some </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antireflux surgery is advocated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> demonstrated to have abnormal reflux regardless of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The malignant potential of the columnar epithelium is higher in men who smoke, in patients with intestinal-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> who continue to have severe reflux, and in patients who develop <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the probability of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is high and esophagectomy should be seriously considered in the hopes that the pathological stage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> is still favorable </plain></SENT>
