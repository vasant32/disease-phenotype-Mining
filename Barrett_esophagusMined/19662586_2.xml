<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical and epidemiological data suggest a potential association between cholecystectomy (CCE) and augmented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 132 patients (67 women, 65 men, median age 55) with typical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were enrolled in the study and divided in cholecystectomized (CCE-group: n = 107) and non- cholecystectomized (nCCE-group: n = 25) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standardized clinical work-up of patients included combined esophageal 24 h pH-measurement and Bilitec 2000 esophageal manometry and upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the statistical analysis no differences between the cholecystectomized group (CCE-group, n = 25) and the patients without cholecystectomy (nCCE-group, n = 107) could be observed in quantity or quality of reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> nor severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> significantly differed between the nCCE and CCE-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the percentage of patients with pathological DGER were significantly higher in the CCE-group as compared to the nCCE-group (76 vs. 55 %, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the CCE-group revealed significant higher levels of pathological DGER compared to the nCCE-group (15.5 % +/- 14.1 vs. 8.6 % +/- 15.4; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To conclude, our data provide first evidence of elevated DGER after CCE in patients with typical clinical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> using the Bilitec device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the frequency and the extent of DGER was significantly increased in the CCE-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are urgently needed to elucidate the impact of CCE on DGER in patients with clinical symptoms of a reflux disease </plain></SENT>
