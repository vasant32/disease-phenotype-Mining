<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results obtained for the treatment of 59 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, randomized to receive medical treatment (n = 27) or antireflux surgery (n = 32) were assessed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up for the patients undergoing medical treatment was 4 (range 1-11) years and for patients undergoing surgical treatment 5 (range 1-11) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory symptomatic control (excellent to good results) was achieved in 24 patients after medical therapy and in 29 after antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with persistent inflammatory lesions (54 per cent) and persistent or recurrent stenosis (47 per cent) was significantly higher after conservative treatment than after surgery (5 and 15 per cent, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decrease in the length of the segment of columnar mucosa was observed in eight of the patients who underwent antireflux surgery, and in only two of those given medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, an upward progression of the columnar lining was more frequent in the latter group (11 versus three) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was observed in five patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from the group undergoing medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was detected in two patients, one undergoing medical treatment and the other following surgical therapy, in whom an antireflux procedure had failed previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both patients underwent oesophageal resection, with confirmation of a <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients in whom antireflux surgery proved effective showed no dysplastic change or progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results, despite the small number of patients and methodological limitations, question the systematic conservative approach in the initial management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
