<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Esophageal gland ducts were found in 5 (10%) of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Paneth cells were observed in 15 (31%) of the 49 patients, being located mainly among mucous cells of intestinalized crypts although a few were also noted in the surface epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the presence of esophageal gland ducts in the columnar epithelium-lined mucosa is a pathognomonic feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 10% of the patients reviewed were considered to have an unequivocal diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Barrett's mucosa showed histological features similar to incomplete-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of gastric mucosa, except for the presence of Paneth cells </plain></SENT>
