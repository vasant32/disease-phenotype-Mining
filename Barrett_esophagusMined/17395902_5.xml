<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Telomeres are shortened by repeated cell divisions and by oxidative DNA damage, and cells with critically shortened telomeres cannot divide </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address our hypothesis, we compared telomere length and telomerase activity in biopsy specimens of esophageal squamous epithelium from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients and control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic biopsies were taken from the esophageal squamous epithelium of 38 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> [10 long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (LSBE), 15 short-segment (SSBE), 13 GERD without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>] and 16 control patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Telomere length was assessed using the terminal restriction fragment assay, and telomerase activity was studied by the PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> had significantly shorter telomeres in the distal esophagus than controls [8.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 10.9 +/- 1.5 (SE) Kbp, P = 0.043] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, telomere length in the distal esophagus did not differ significantly in those with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (LSBE 7.9 +/- 0.8, SSBE 8.6 +/- 0.9, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> without BE 8.7 +/- 1.0 Kbp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in telomerase activity in the distal esophagus were noted between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and controls (4.0 +/- 0.39 vs. 5.2 +/- 0.53 RIUs) </plain></SENT>
