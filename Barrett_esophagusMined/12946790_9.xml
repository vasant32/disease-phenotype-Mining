<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The management of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Twenty patients (group 1, prompt attitude) underwent operation as soon as high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) was discovered (n = 8) or just after either the presence of HGD was confirmed (n = 9) or invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IC) was found (n = 3) in a second set of biopsy samples taken soon after HGD had been discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, esophagectomy in 13 patients (group 2, expectant attitude) was performed only because HGD persisted (n = 4) or turned into IC (n = 4) at endoscopic followup (7 to 23 months) (subgroup 2a, n = 8) or because HGD (n = 2) or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) (n = 3) was disregarded until <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and IC developed (12 to 70 months) (subgroup 2b, n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skeletonizing en-bloc esophagectomy was performed in 29 patients and four patients (three with HGD and one with mucosal IC in the resected specimen) underwent vagus-sparing esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was found in 11 of 24 patients (45.8%) supposed to have only HGD (in repeat biopsies in 3 patients from group 1 and in the resected specimen in eight of 21 patients (38%) operated on for HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Metastatic lymph nodes were found in the resected specimen of seven patients (group 1: one of 20 or 5%, versus subgroup 2a: two of eight or 25%, versus subgroup 2b: four of five or 80%; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike none of the 26 patients (0%) with an intramural process, five of the seven patients (71.4%) with an extramural process (one had had disregarded LGD) developed neoplastic recurrence at followup (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>-related survival in the long term was 100% in group 1 versus 52.5% in group 2 (p = 0.0094) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is present in almost one half of patients with HGD within a Barrett's area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Promptness in the decision regarding an esophageal resection as soon as HGD is found is much safer than expectant observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Not enrolling a patient with LGD in an endoscopic surveillance program can lead to the development of extramural IC with poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
