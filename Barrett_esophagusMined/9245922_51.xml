<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prevalence of short segment Barrett's (SSB) oesophagus, defined as the absence of macroscopic Barrett's but histologically identifiable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, has been reported to be 18% based on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To define the prevalence of SSB oesophagus using H&amp;E and alcian blue staining and to determine whether SSB oesophagus is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Consecutive patients (n = 158) presenting for endoscopy completed a structured interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two biopsy specimens taken from the GOJ were stained with H&amp;E, alcian blue and Giemsa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A third specimen was obtained from the distal oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was diagnosed if goblet cells were definitely identified by two independent observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SSB oesophagus was present in 46 (prevalence 36%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 28.5-43.5) using alcian blue staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If H&amp;E had been the sole staining method used, 50% cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> would have been overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> identified by H&amp;E but missed by alcian blue staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis identified age (odds ratio (OR) per decade 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06), histological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4-7.2) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> at the gastrooesophageal junction (OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.2-15.6) as independent risk factors for SSB oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Unrecognised SSB oesophagus is highly prevalent in patients presenting for diagnostic upper endoscopy if alcian blue staining is applied </plain></SENT>
