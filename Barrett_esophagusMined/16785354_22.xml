<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study provides a critical assessment of outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQL) after esophagectomy for HGD and IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cohort analytic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Section of thoracic surgery at a tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who presented between May 1991 and February 2003 with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> with HGD or IMC were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prospective analysis of postoperative morbidity, mortality, HRQL, and gastrointestinal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up was complete in 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 4.9 years (range, 0.5-12.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> was 39%, with stages ranging from I to IIB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 4 major complications (11%) and no operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients were alive, with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free survival of 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The HRQL outcomes (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) were comparable with those of age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in postesophagectomy gastrointestinal symptoms were seen with a decreased incidence of heartburn (P &lt; or = .001) and increased requirement for a slower speed of eating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two (79%) of the 28 patients described their current eating pattern as "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or insignificantly impacted." CONCLUSIONS: Esophagectomy for HGD and IMC can be accomplished with low morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, most patients are able to resume a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> eating pattern, and postoperative HRQL can be equivalent to that of the general population </plain></SENT>
