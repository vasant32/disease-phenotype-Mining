<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> predisposes individuals to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo>, which develops from intermediate stages of tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> primarily in the vicinity of the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the cellular and molecular events in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> may contribute to its early diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutation and overexpression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor p53 have previously been observed in Barrett high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CdK) inhibitor p21 can be up-regulated by p53, resulting in the down-regulation of cell division at the G(1)/S-phase transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current study examined the correlation between the expression of p21 and p53 by quantifying their levels during the progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in Barrett esophageal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Barrett esophageal tissue samples that were negative or indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, contained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and contained <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Paraffin embedded sections of lining and glandular epithelia were adsorbed with primary murine antibodies against human p21 or p53 followed by horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An immunoreactivity score for each primary antibody and section was obtained by multiplying a staining intensity factor by the percent of positively stained cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nuclear p21 expression was detectable immunohistochemically in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> that was negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, but it was significantly elevated (P &lt;/= 0.05) in tissues scored as indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, positive for low grade or high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and positive for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, p53 expression did not parallel p21 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>p53 levels were low in the early stages of Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and were increased in high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in p21 or p53 levels between glandular and lining epithelia in Barrett tissue throughout the histologic stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> evaluated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: p21 expression in Barrett tissue scored as indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was significantly elevated relative to p53 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of p21 were also observed in high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, in which they do not appear to be effective in down-regulating cell division </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Analysis of p21 and p53 expression may aid in the evaluation of tissue abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
