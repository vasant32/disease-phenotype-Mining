<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance has been suggested, but esophageal brush cytology (BC) has not been widely utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytologic descriptions of BE, especially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath>, are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied matched cytologic and histologic materials from 26 patients with BE and 4 patients with concurrent BE and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In six patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy, BE was recognized on BC by the presence of goblet cells within clusters of uniform columnar cells with vesicular nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> in 18 BC samples revealed small clusters of haphazardly oriented, mildly pleomorphic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their larger nuclei had thickened membranes, evenly dispersed chromatin and occasional multiple nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cytologic differentiation of histologically graded low- and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cases displayed numerous isolated cells exhibiting flagrant malignant features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that BE lesions are cytologically distinctive and suggest that BC may play a role in surveillance </plain></SENT>
