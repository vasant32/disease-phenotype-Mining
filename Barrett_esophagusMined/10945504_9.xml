<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In BE, AC, squamous epithelium (SQ) and gastric cardia, the activities of the haem biosynthetic enzymes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17381">porphobilinogen</z:chebi> deaminase (PBG-D) and ferrochelatase (FC) and the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> power index--the ratio between PBG-D and FC in BE and AC in comparison with SQ--were determined before ALA ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following ALA administration, ALA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17381">porphobilinogen</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27484">uroporphyrin I</z:chebi> and PPIX were determined in tissues and plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> power index did not predict the level of intracellular accumulation of PPIX found at 6.7 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In BE, there was no selectivity of PPIX accumulation compared to SQ, whereas in half of patients with AC selectivity was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher haem biosynthetic enzyme activities (i.e. PBG-D) and lower PPIX precursor concentrations were found in BE and AC compared to SQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that PPIX levels will peak at earlier time intervals in BE and AC compared to SQ </plain></SENT>
