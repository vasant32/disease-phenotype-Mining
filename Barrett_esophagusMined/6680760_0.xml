<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An attempt is made to correlate clinical respectively endoscopic and histomorphological findings in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The histological stage Ia cannot be identified endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, certain correlations can be found between endoscopic stage I (the "red spot") on the one hand and the histological stage Ib (hyperemic capillaries) on the other, just as well as between subsequent endoscopical and histological stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histomorphological stage IV corresponds to the clinical stage IV and represents the ultimate complication of the reflux disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo> caused by ulceration plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>endobrachyesophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this stage no restitutio ad integrum is possible anymore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial changes of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> occur within the epithelium and the papillae and can be recognized microscopically in biopsies taken during endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in the submucosal layer are of no importance during the early reversible stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lining of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">endobrachyoesophagus</z:e> with cylindrical epithelium ("Barrett mucosa") is probably the consequence of reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This type of lining presents an irregular picture from the morphological as well as from the clinical point of view and is to be considered as a pre-stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
