<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of previous studies have reported patients with Barrett's columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> who have an increase or decrease in segment length over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether patients who have an apparent shortening of the metaplastic segment are subsequently at a lower neoplastic risk and those whose segment length appears to increase are at a higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate these issues by studying a large cohort of patients from the UK National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records of 1533 patients registered with the UK National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> Registry were examined from seven UK centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted on metaplastic segment length at surveillance endoscopies and histological findings on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall changes in segment length, variability in measurement and probability of the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> over time were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At least two segment lengths were measured in 763 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median change from measured diagnostic length to most outlying measured segment length was 3.0 cm, but overall there was no tendency for segment length to increase or decrease in the majority of patients with a follow up of up to 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eighty-six patients had three or more segment lengths over the first 10 years of follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No change in risk was demonstrated in these patients where length appeared to consistently increase with time or when it appeared to decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, metaplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> segment length does not change over time, and when an apparent change is observed, this does not influence a risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
