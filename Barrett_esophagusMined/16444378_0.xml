<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is the most serious complication of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and presents a malignant potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of the tumoral marker p53 increases with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the p53 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> according to the two positive immunostaining criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The material was constituted by endoscopic biopsy specimens from 42 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Section of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded biopsies were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin, <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-alcian blue and evaluated the p53 immunohistochemical expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two p53 immunostaining criteria were utilized: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The staining of, at least, half of the nuclei, and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The staining of any nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was confirmed by the agreement between three pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total number of tissue specimens was 229, with an average of 5.4 specimens per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath>, with agreement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathologists examining the same set of slides, was detected in six (14.3%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>According to the two different p53 immunostaining criteria, the protein was detected in non-dysplastic Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, respectively, in 5 (13.9%) and 14 (38.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Specifically in the six dysplastic cases, p53 was detected, according to the immunostaining criteria, in one (16.7%) and four (66.7%) cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this group, p53 immunohistochemical expression, regardless of positive criteria take into account, was not useful for detecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
