<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy using porfimer <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> is the only approved endoscopic treatment for use in patients with Barrett's high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine clinical characteristics, endoscopic findings and treatment complications in Barrett's high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> patients undergoing photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed our experience using porfimer <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> photodynamic therapy to treat patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data collected included patients characteristics, presentation symptoms, endoscopic findings, subsequent use of surveillance endoscopy and outcome after photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Since 1997, 102 patients with Barrett's high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (69 patients) or mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (33 patients) have been treated with photodynamic therapy using porfimer <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> as an alternative to oesophagectomy (median series follow-up time = 1.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Almost half (46%) of patients had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> detected on their first endoscopy and the remainder (54%) were found during surveillance of known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptoms typically associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophageal disease</z:e> were only found in 29 of 47 (62%) patients in whom <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was detected on the initial endoscopy - <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> in 13 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in nine patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> gastro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophageal disease</z:e> in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison of endoscopic characteristics found the median Barrett's glandular segment length was significantly shorter in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients (median 3 cm; range: 1-12) vs. Barrett's high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> patients (median 5 cm; range: 1-16, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall treatment results found complete ablation of glandular epithelium with one course of photodynamic therapy in most patients (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stricture requiring dilation occurred in 20 patients (20%) was the most common serious adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy failed to ablate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in four patients and subsequent oesophagectomy was curative in three of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 40% of newly diagnosed patients with Barrett's associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> had no oesophageal symptoms and had <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> associated with short segment (3 cm or less) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy is a highly effective, safe and minimally invasive first-line treatment for patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
