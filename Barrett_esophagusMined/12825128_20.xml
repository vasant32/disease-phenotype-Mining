<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic grading of the gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV) is a useful predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> status; abnormal GEFV was associated with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> is often found in Japanese patients and is inversely related to reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the association between GEFV, reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, Barrett's epithelium, and atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> in Japanese patients by prospective endoscopic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 548 Japanese patients (296 men and 252 women; mean age, 57.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GEFV was assessed by the classification of Hill and colleagues, reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was assessed by the Los Angeles classification, and the degree of atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> was scored as: none, mild, moderate, or severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Barrett's epithelium was recognized by the endoscopic detection of an upward shift in the columnar lining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's epithelium were found in 42 (7.7%) and 67 (12.2%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increased prevalence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's epithelium was correlated with an increased grade of GEFV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal GEFV (grades III and IV) was a risk for reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (adjusted odds ratio [OR]), 13.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.08-29.25) and Barrett's epithelium (OR, 3.55 [95% CI, 2.04-6.20]), while the presence of atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> was inversely associated with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (OR, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.07-0.36]), but it was not associated with the prevalence of Barrett's epithelium (OR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.67-2.01]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Barrett's epithelium and the severity of atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> increased with age, while that of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and abnormal GEFV did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's epithelium are associated with abnormal GEFV in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> is inversely related to reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, but it is not related to Barrett's epithelium in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
