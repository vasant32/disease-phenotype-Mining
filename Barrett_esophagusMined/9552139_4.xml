<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current report, pre- and postoperative function of the antireflux barrier is examined in children having laparoscopic fundoplication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, aged 7.2+/-4.5 years, were operated on for unremitting gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 24), with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory tract disease</z:e> (n = 11), cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (n = 2), or brain damage (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gastrostomy was added in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">Barium</z:chebi> contrast study, pH-metering, endoscopic examination, and biopsy were performed before and after a median of 19 months (range, 8 to 46) after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At diagnosis, 15 of 21 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> that was moderate or severe in 11 (1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptoms disappeared after fundoplication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 patients, in whom they became milder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reflux index decreased from 20.2+/-20% to 4.9+/-9% and became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except 4 children (2 with brain damage and 1 with cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Open repair of the failed wrap was considered necessary in only 1 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic fundoplication is as effective as the open procedure (14% overall failure rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the failure rate in neurologic patients (18%) suggests that before reaching conclusions on the benefits of this approach, careful long-term assessment of the functional results is necessary </plain></SENT>
