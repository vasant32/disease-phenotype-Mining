<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the possible effect these medications may have on the risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) in patients with existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of patients with BE identified in the national Department of Veterans' Affairs computerized databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases with incident EAC were matched by incidence density sampling to controls with BE who remained without EAC at the date of the EAC diagnosis for the corresponding case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified prescriptions for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>/aspirin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> that were filled between BE diagnosis and EAC diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence density ratios were calculated using conditional logistic regression models that adjusted for race, outpatient encounters, a disease comorbidity index, and socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a cohort of 11,823 patients with first-time BE diagnosis, we examined 116 EAC cases and 696 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most cases and controls had at least one filled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> prescription (95% vs 94%; P = .5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this setting of almost universal <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use, filled <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>/aspirin prescriptions were associated with a reduced risk of EAC (adjusted incidence density ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Filled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> prescriptions also were associated with a reduction in EAC risk (0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.86), with a significant trend toward greater risk reduction with longer duration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the strong inverse associations with even short periods of use raise concerns of uncontrolled confounding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This observational study indicates that in patients with BE using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>/aspirin, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy might reduce the risk of developing EAC </plain></SENT>
