<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that endoscopy could be replaced with non-invasive assessment of helicobacter status in the initial work up of young dyspeptic patients without sinister symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the incidence of gastro-oesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in young dyspeptic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Alberta Endoscopy Project captured clinical and demographic data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> endoscopies performed from April 1993 to February 1996 at four major adult hospitals in Alberta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic and histological diagnosis in a subgroup of patients under 45 years of age without alarm symptoms that had undergone gastroscopy was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a random list of 200 patients was generated and their medical records reviewed in order to assess the proportion with symptoms suitable for a non-invasive management strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gastroscopy was performed in 7004 patients under 45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3634 patients (56% female) alarm type symptoms were absent; 78.9% of patients had symptoms amenable to a non-invasive initial approach, giving a corrected sample size of 2867 patients (correction factor 0.789) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo>, one case of moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 10 biopsy proved cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, and 19 oesophageal strictures/rings were detected within this sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The corrected prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> in this select population was 1.05 per thousand patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Endoscopy yielded three <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> in this sample of under 45 year old dyspeptic patients without sinister symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While initial non-invasive screening with one-week triple therapy for helicobacter positive individuals is unlikely to have a detrimental outcome the physician is advised to consider endoscopy in patients with persisting, recurrent, or sinister symptoms </plain></SENT>
