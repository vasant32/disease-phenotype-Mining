<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients with known or treated malignant and precancerous esophageal lesions were sensitized with orally administered ALA (15 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, with or without severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 5 squamous cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or early-stage (uT1N0M0) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 1 advanced-stage (uT3N1) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and 1 patient a lesion with an appearance that suggested <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent photodynamic diagnosis for follow-up after treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> with curative intent; 6 had no macroscopically visible lesion and 3 a barely visible lesion under standard (white-light) endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic diagnosis was conducted 6 to 7 hours after oral administration of ALA by using a special light source capable of delivering either white or violet-blue light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Red fluorescence was detected with a charged coupled device camera attached to a fiberoptic endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corresponding endoscopic, fluorescence, and microscopic findings were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By using histology as the reference standard (n = 86 biopsies), 85% of the biopsy sites with premalignant or malignant histopathology exhibited red fluorescence, whereas only 25% were detected with white-light endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ALA-induced fluorescence might be useful for the early endoscopic detection of malignant esophageal lesions and follow-up after treatment of such lesions with curative intent </plain></SENT>
