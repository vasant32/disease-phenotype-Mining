<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several techniques for esophageal resection have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the morbidity, mortality, and early survival of patients after transthoracic esophagectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> using current staging techniques and neoadjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The technique includes right thoracotomy, laparotomy, and cervical esophagogastrostomy (total thoracic esophagectomy) with radical mediastinal and abdominal lymph node dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred forty-two patients had surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> between 1989 and 2000 at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred fifty consecutive patients had esophagectomy using this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier curves and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by postsurgical pathologic stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age was 62.7 years (31 to 86 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one percent (202) had induction chemotherapy (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with clinical T3/4 or N1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative complications included recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (14% [35]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo> (9%, [22]), and leak (8%, [19]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median length of stay was 13 days (5 to 330 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In-hospital or 30-day mortality was 3.6% (9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 3 years was 44%; median survival was 25 months, and 3-year survival by posttreatment pathologic stage was: stage 0 (complete response) (n = 60), 56%; stage I (n = 32), 65%; stage IIA (n = 67), 41%; stage IIB (n = 30), 46%; and stage III (n = 49), 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 24 months (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 1.6, 0 to 138 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in situ, 6 patients with stage IV disease, and 1 patient who could not be staged (12 pts) were excluded from survival and multivariate calculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In univariate and different models of multivariate analysis, age more than 65 years, posttreatment T3, and nodal involvement were predictive of poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For univariate analysis, p = 0.002, p = 0.004, p = 0.02, respectively; for multivariate analysis, p = 0.001, p = 0.003, p = 0.02, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total thoracic esophagectomy with node dissection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> appears to have acceptable morbidity and mortality with encouraging survival results in the setting of neoadjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Patients who show complete response after induction chemoradiotherapy appear to have improved long-term survival </plain></SENT>
