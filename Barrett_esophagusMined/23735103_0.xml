<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are two CLE systems available, one probe-based and the other with a microscope embedded in the tip of an endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several CLE image classification systems are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies suggest that CLE has good sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, with good interobserver agreement using the CLE image classification systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Larger, multicenter studies have been completed evaluating the impact of CLE on treatment of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
