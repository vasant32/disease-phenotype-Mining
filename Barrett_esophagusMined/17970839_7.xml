<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied patients diagnosed with BE in the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area (MESA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of diagnosed BE, estimate the annual incidence of initial diagnosis of BE, and characterize the demographics of patients diagnosed with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients diagnosed with BE until December 31, 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) reports were reviewed to establish the presence of columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> slides were retrieved and reviewed by a gastrointestinal pathologist to establish the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chart abstraction was conducted using a standardized form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE was histologically confirmed in 216 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were white, 165 (76%) were male, and 81% had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median age at diagnosis was 65.5 yr (range 17-94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-segment BE (LSBE) was present in 112 (51.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of histologically confirmed BE in MESA was 261.8 (95% CI 222.5-301.1) per 100,000 people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of an initial diagnosis of BE between 1996 and 2002 was 32.7 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 27.1-38.2) and did not change significantly over the study period despite an increase in EGD rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the initial diagnosis, 41.7% of the patients were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was present in 24.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of initial diagnosis of BE in a stable white population did not change significantly over a 7-yr period, despite an increase in EGD rates </plain></SENT>
