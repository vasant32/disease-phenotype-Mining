<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ATOH1 (a factor associated with Notch signaling) plays an important role in differentiation of stem cells into goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between the Notch signaling pathway and Cdx2 expression in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has not been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the interrelationship between Notch signaling and Cdx2 in esophageal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expressions of Cdx2, MUC2, and intracellular signaling molecules related to Notch signaling (Notch1, Hes1, and ATOH1) were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical staining with biopsy specimens obtained from esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) with goblet cells (IM⁺) and columnar epithelium not accompanied by goblet cells (IM⁻) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For in vitro experiments, we employed human esophageal epithelial cell lines (OE33, OE19, and Het-1A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After forced Cdx2 expression by applying a Cdx2 expression vector to the cells, changes in the expressions of Notch1, Hes1, ATOH1, Cdx2, and MUC2 were analyzed by real-time PCR and western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in expressions of Notch1, Hes1, ATOH1, Cdx2, and MUC2 in cells were analyzed following stimulation with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> in the presence or absence of Cdx2 blocking with Cdx2-siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Suppressed Hes1 and enhanced ATOH1 and MUC2 expressions were identified in IM⁺ specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forced expression of Cdx2 in cells suppressed Hes1, and enhanced ATOH1 and MUC2 expressions, whereas <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> suppressed Hes1, and enhanced ATOH1, Cdx2, and MUC2 expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, these effects were blocked by siRNA-based Cdx2 downregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Enhanced expression of Cdx2 by stimulation with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> may induce intestinal differentiation of esophageal columnar cells by interaction with the Notch signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
