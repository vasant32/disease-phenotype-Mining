<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine esophagus specimens with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (seven <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>) were studied directly after resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> (T) and regional lymph nodes (N) were classified, and the results were compared to histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: T classification with endoluminal MRI was correct in eight of the nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One Tis <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was staged as T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> because of submucosal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI detected 35 of 91 lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 35 nodes, 14 were true-positives, 5 were false-positives, 1 was a false-negative, and 15 were true-negatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the 56 missed lymph nodes were outside the field of view, including two specimens with a tight stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These lymph nodes included seven nodes with metastatic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TN classification was correct in six specimens (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This ex vivo pilot study demonstrates that T classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> using endoluminal MRI is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of lymph node classification are less favorable, predominantly because of the limited field of view </plain></SENT>
