<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite its high prevalence, data on the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) are still sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is also an ongoing debate on the natural history of its various manifestations, i.e., non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) vs. erosive reflux disease (ERD) vs. <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted within the framework of a prospective multicenter study on the course and prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1014 dyspeptic patients were screened by the means of upper GI endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were recorded by the use of a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At least 15 months after the initial examination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were invited for follow-up (FU) examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were analyzed separately with respect to their clinical and endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the latter, only patients without any treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump-inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) prior to initial and follow-up examinations were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> positive if typical symptoms were present and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sufficient clinical and/or endoscopic data were available in 590 GERD patients with heartburn at least once a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data could be obtained in 320 patients (clinical FU: n = 304; endoscopic FU: n = 52) after a mean follow-up period of 35 months (18-48 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>96 of 144 previously asymptomatic patients (67%) remained asymptomatic at follow-up, the rest (n = 48) were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>143 of 304 previously symptomatic patients (47%) were symptom-free at follow-up, and only 161 patients (53%) remained symptomatic or had concomitant therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump-inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For follow-up endoscopy in patients off <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> (n = 52), ERD was no longer confirmed in 7/12 ERD patients (58%), whereas progress to ERD was found in 3/34 patients (9%) in the NERD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>BE was newly diagnosed in two NERD patients but could no longer be detected in 2 of 6 patients with an initial diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With respect to its clinical as well as its endoscopic manifestations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> does not appear to be very stable over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, in most cases this is due to regression rather than progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
