<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We rigorously tested modified 1988 criteria, assessing intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants submitted slides of Barrett mucosa negative (BE) and indefinite (IND) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred fifty slides were divided into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first 125 slides were reviewed, without knowledge of the prior diagnoses, on 2 occasions by 12 gastrointestinal pathologists without prior discussion of criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were analyzed by kappa statistics, which correct for agreement by chance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A consensus meeting was then held, establishing, by group review of the index 125 slides, the criteria outlined herein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second 125-slide set was then reviewed twice by each of the same 12 pathologists, and follow-up kappa statistics were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When statistical analysis was performed using 2 broad diagnostic categories (BE, IND, and LG v HG and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>), intraobserver agreement was near perfect both before and after the consensus meeting (mean kappa = 0.82 and 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was substantial (kappa = 0.66) and improved after the consensus meeting (kappa = 0.70; P =.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When statistical analysis was performed using 4 clinically relevant separations (BE; IND and LGD; HGD; <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>), mean intraobserver kappa improved from 0.64 to 0.68 (both substantial) after the consensus meeting, and mean interobserver kappa improved from 0.43 to 0.46 (both moderate agreement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When statistical analysis was performed using 4 diagnostic categories that required distinction between LGD and IND (BE; IND; LGD; HGD and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>), the pre-consensus meeting mean intraobserver kappa was 0.60 (substantial agreement), improving to 0.65 after the meeting (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was poorer, with premeeting and postmeeting mean values unchanged (kappa = 0.43 at both times) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was substantial for HGD/<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (kappa = 0.65), moderate to substantial for BE (kappa = 0.58), fair for LGD (kappa = 0.32), and slight for IND (kappa = 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The intraobserver reproducibility for the diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE was substantial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Interobserver reproducibility was substantial at the ends of the spectrum (BE and HG/<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) but slight for IND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Both intraobserver and interobserver variation improved overall after the application of a modified grading system developed at a consensus conference but not in separation of BE, IND, and LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The criteria used by the group are presented </plain></SENT>
