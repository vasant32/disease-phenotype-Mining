<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Barrett oesophagus is replacement of squamous epithelium to specialised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is associated with an increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> which develops through <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the relative age of occurrence and incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in this part of our country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1999 and June 2002 we diagnosed 13 cases of Barrett oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sections were stained with routine H and E and special stain alcian blue (AB)--<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> at pH 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 55 patients with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e>, 13 cases were diagnosed as Barrett oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 8 males and 5 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Majority of the patients (77%) were between 20-40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At endoscopy, in 84.6% patients, lesions were in the form of islands of red mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On histology examination, in 6 cases, squamous epithelium was replaced by intestinal epithelium containing goblet cells and in 7 cases it was replaced by gastric epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was not seen in any of the case, while one case showed associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Barrett oesophagus is seen in a younger population amongst Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A male predominance is noted, but is not as high as reported in Western literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is a paucity of patients with pure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that there are a number of patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, very few patients present with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, indicating that Barrett oesophagus is a silent disease presenting later as a <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
