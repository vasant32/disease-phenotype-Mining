<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) has remained an enigma for several decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Starting with the basics, the definition and diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) continues to be a point of major debate globally leading to definitions that have been restrictive (requiring histologically confirmed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-encompassing (simply the presence of CLE at endoscopy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interest in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> stems from studies that have consistently demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> both adjacent to and remote from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proponents of not requiring histology suggest that if a sufficient number of biopsies is obtained over an adequate period of time, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> can usually be demonstrated in such cases and that the true neoplastic potential of the cardiac and fundic-type mucosa detected in the CLE has not been delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optimal number of biopsies required to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> is largely unknown, and in this issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology, Harrison et al. add to the limited data on this subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is ample evidence that once a diagnosis of BE is made, it has significant implications on the financial, psychosocial, and insurance status of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We feel that an optimal, practical definition of BE requires clear, accepted, reproducible, and clinically relevant criteria with evidence of an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>--the most crucial consequence of the lesion--and discuss the pros and cons of the need for documenting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the CLE </plain></SENT>
