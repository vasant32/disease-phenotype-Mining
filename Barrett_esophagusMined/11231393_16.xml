<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: If areas of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> can be identified at endoscopy, the number of biopsies could be reduced and the sensitivity of biopsy surveillance would increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> (MB) dye staining may be useful for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients were prospectively studied with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Staining involved sequential spraying of 10% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi>, 0.5% MB and water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quadrantic biopsies were obtained from Barrett's epithelium and collected in separate containers depending on whether they were taken from stained or unstained areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients undergoing yearly surveillance were asked to compare the discomfort of this endoscopy with that of previous surveillance endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were analyzed for the presence and the percentage of SIM and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by a nonblinded pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MB staining prolonged endoscopy by a mean of 8 minutes (47% increase in procedure time) and was associated with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> during the procedure in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Staining was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 7 patients undergoing yearly endoscopic surveillance indicated more discomfort with endoscopy plus MB staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 37 biopsies from stained mucosa, 20 contained SIM; of 23 from unstained mucosa, 15 contained SIM (57% sensitivity, 32% specificity for MB staining) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this small, nonblinded study MB staining was associated with prolongation of endoscopy, increased patient discomfort, and potentially serious complications and was neither very sensitive nor specific for SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is our recommendation that this technique should not be routinely used in endoscopic surveillance of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies of MB staining are needed </plain></SENT>
