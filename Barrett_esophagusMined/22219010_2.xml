<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="7" ids="33372">Neodymium</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="28984">aluminum</z:chebi>-garnet laser ablation and successful antireflux surgery for 18 patients with metaplastic BE primarily resulted in the total histologic eradication of BE in 15 patients (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After antireflux surgery, the healing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) was objectively verified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At late follow-up evaluation, endoscopy, conventional histology, molecular <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> analyses in comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control conditions (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine [8-OHdG], <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase [SOD], <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> [GSH], myeloperoxydase [MP]), and immunohistochemistry (p53, and Cdx2, caudal-related homeobox gene 2, marking intestinal differentiation) of the neosquamous epithelium were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up period (range, 3-15 years; mean, 8 years), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was detected histologically in eight patients (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients had macroscopic BE (mean length, 3.5 cm; range 1-10 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neosquamous epithelium was histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, with no underlying columnar tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fundoplication was endoscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 14 patients (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 8-OHdG level was higher in the neosquamous epithelium than in the control conditions in the distal esophagus (4.3 vs. 0.52; P = 0.0002) and the proximal esophagus (1.8 vs. 0.95; P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Likewise, SOD activity was higher in the neosquamous epithelium (0.38 vs. 0.12; P = 0.0005), whereas MP activity and GSH levels remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients showed slight nuclear p53 expression (typical in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> inflammatory reactions), whereas Cdx2 positivity was confined to one case with recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The neosquamous mucosa, generated by the ablation of BE and the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with fundoplication, was stable during long-term follow-up evaluation in two-thirds of the patients with initial eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> p53 expression and no Cdx2 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> of the neosquamous esophagus remained high, although the clinical significance of this is unclear </plain></SENT>
