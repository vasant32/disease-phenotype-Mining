<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and its only recognized precursor lesion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, has rapidly increased during the past three decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise reason for the rise remains to be elucidated, but increasing rates have been linked to multiple nutritional factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plant-based diets have generally been associated with a reduction of risk for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and those of animal origin with risk escalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a number of recent in vitro and limited in vivo investigations have reported that cranberry extracts affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple cancer</z:e>-associated processes in breast, colon, prostate, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines of epithelial origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study sought to investigate the chemopreventive potential of a cranberry <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26267">proanthocyanidin</z:chebi> rich extract (PAC) in SEG-1 human esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PAC pretreatment significantly inhibited the viability and proliferation of EAC cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PAC (50 microg/mL) significantly inhibited acid-induced cell proliferation of SEG-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PAC treatment induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 checkpoint and significantly reduced the percentage of SEG-1 cells in S-phase following 24 and 48 h of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PAC treatment also resulted in significant induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, PAC modulates cell cycle regulation, aberrant proliferation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> key biological processes altered during progression to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings support that further mechanistic studies are warranted to more fully elucidate the inhibitory potential of PAC against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
