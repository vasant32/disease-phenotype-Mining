<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to use biomarkers to assess for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients with either squamous islands or complete reversal of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> to squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The biomarkers included proliferation characteristic using Ki-67, p53 abnormalities using immunohistochemical methods with two antibodies, DO-1 and DO-7, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp>) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients had complete reversal produced by a combination of acid suppression and thermal injury (multipolar electrocoagulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 staining was indistinguishable from that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal epithelium, i.e., basal layer staining only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 11 cases were negative for p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> activity was low and in the range for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had squamous islands (partial reversal) after prolonged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multilayer Ki-67 staining occurred in nine cases (64%), and six (43%) had areas of positive p53 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Initial biomarker studies suggest that completely reversed squamous epithelium is biologically similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium and of low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, partial reversal, manifest as squamous islands, is accompanied by biomarker abnormalities </plain></SENT>
