<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the regression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> to cardiac mucosa in patients followed more than 5 years after operation, by repeated endoscopy with biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study included 78 patients with BE submitted to combined vagotomy, antrectomy (an antireflux procedure), and Roux-en-Y gastrointestinal reconstruction with more than 60 months follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided in 3 groups: (1) 31 with short-segment BE (&lt; or =30 mm length); (2) 42 with long-segment BE (31 to 99 mm length); and (3) 5 with extra-long-segment BE (&gt; or =100 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient had at least three endoscopic procedures with multiple biopsies during a mean follow up of 95 months (range, 60-220 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e> were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of patients with short segment BE had regression to cardiac mucosa at a mean of 40 months after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two percent of patients with long segment BE had regression to cardiac mucosa at a mean of 47 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No regression occurred in the 5 patients with extra-long segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 20% of patients, regression to fundic mucosa occurred between 78 to 94 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient progressed to low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, but no patient progressed to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e> studies demonstrated that in asymptomatic patients, reflux was abolished; 90% of the patients had a Visick grade of 1 or 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vagotomy and antrectomy combined with duodenal bile diversion abolish acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e> into the distal esophagus in patients with BE, which is accompanied by a regression of BE from intestinal to cardiac or fundic mucosa in about 60% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This regression is time dependent and varies directly with the length of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The potential for an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> effect, especially in young patients with long segment BE, suggests that this operation may become an attractive option as a definitive surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with short segment BE submitted to this procedure behave similar to patients submitted to Nissen fundoplication, and therefore in these patients, we do not advocate this complex operation </plain></SENT>
