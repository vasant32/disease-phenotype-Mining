<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The subgroup of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) that should undergo endoscopy to rule out <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has not been well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GOALS: To examine demographic and clinical variables predictive of BE before endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY: A validated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> questionnaire was administered to 107 patients with biopsy-proven BE and to 104 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> but no BE shown by endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frequent symptoms were defined as symptoms that occurred at least once or more each week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severity of symptoms was rated on a scale from 1 to 4 (mild to very severe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed to determine whether demographic characteristics and the duration, severity, and frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms were associated with the identification of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients and 82% of the BE patients completed the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the groups in terms of race, gender, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BE patients were older (median age, 64 vs. 57 years, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariable logistic regression, an age of more than 40 years ( p = 0.008), the presence of heartburn or acid regurgitation ( p = 0.03), and heartburn more than once a week ( p = 0.007) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> independent predictors of the presence of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, patients with BE were less likely to report severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms ( p = 0.0008) and nocturnal symptoms ( p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Duration of symptoms, race, alcohol, and smoking history were not associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Upper endoscopy should be performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients more than 40 years of age who report heartburn once or more per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The severity of symptoms and the presence of nocturnal symptoms are not reliable indicators of the presence of BE </plain></SENT>
