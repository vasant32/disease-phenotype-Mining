<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Recurrent disease</z:e> after endoscopic ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> should be detected early to prevent malignant progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the incidence and patterns of disease recurrence in patients after liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), including the area below the neosquamocolumnar junction (NSCJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study of prospectively collected data on consecutive cases of endoscopic ablation with liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy for Barrett's HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment surveillance biopsies were obtained of suspicious lesions and in 4 quadrants every 1 cm in the treated esophagus and just below the NSCJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measures were location and histology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 36 patients (median age 62 years, 92% men) were enrolled, and 11 (30%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> in a median of 6.5 months; three developed a second recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten recurrences (71%) were identified below the NSCJ in 9 patients, including HGD (4), low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) (2), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six recurrences were identified in the treated esophagus in five patients, including intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (1), HGD (1), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> involving both locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultimately 33 patients (92%) achieved a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis in the remaining three was LGD (1) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most patients with recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> after ablation achieve a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Recurrent disease</z:e> commonly involves the area just below the NSCJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Surveillance endoscopies should include this area to accurately identify patients with disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
