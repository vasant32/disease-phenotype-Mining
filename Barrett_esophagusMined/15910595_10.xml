<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To devise clinically applicable methods for assessing p53 and Ki67 immunohistochemical (IHC) reactivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BE) and to compare the interobserver agreement between these methods and routine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen biopsies diagnosed as BE, selected from the files of the University Hospital MAS, Malmo, were re-evaluated for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by three pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For IHC analysis areas with the most prominent positivity were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean of p53+ epithelial nuclei/high-power field (HPF) was obtained by counting between 1 and 5 HPFs/biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A proliferation quotient (PQ) was obtained by dividing the number of Ki67+ epithelial nuclei in the upper half by the lower half of the mucosa, using two HPFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean kappa values were 0.24, 0.71 and 0.52 for H&amp;E, p53 and Ki67 evaluations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between increasing severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, IHC measurable overexpression of p53 and shift of the mucosal proliferation zone towards the surface, measured as PQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The described methods for p53 and Ki67 evaluation are more reproducible than routine H&amp;E evaluation of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the IHC methods correlate with the severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and are useful supplementary prognostic markers </plain></SENT>
