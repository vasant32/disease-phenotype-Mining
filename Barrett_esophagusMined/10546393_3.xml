<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1979 to 1998, 21 men and five women (mean age: 53 years) with histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent an antireflux procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean length of Barrett's epithelium was 5.9 cm for 19 patients (73.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients (23.1%) had tongue lesions of Barrett's epithelium, and one (3.8%) had ectopic gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had a preoperative esophageal biopsy that revealed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laparotomy was performed in 17 cases and laparoscopy in nine cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative endoscopic local treatment with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> coagulation was performed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical mean follow-up was 78 months and endoscopic mean follow-up was 59.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No increase in the length of the Barrett's epithelium was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (27%) had complete or partial regression (among them three patients with tongue lesions and one patient preoperatively treated by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patients developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is possible but not frequent and unpredictable after antireflux procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, endoscopic and histological surveillance should be continued postoperatively </plain></SENT>
