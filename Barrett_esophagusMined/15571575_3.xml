<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) is frequently performed in patients with heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the benefit of an EGD is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective is to determine the clinical impact of performing an EGD in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with alarm symptoms or persistent heartburn from primary care and gastroenterology clinics were invited to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with known reflux complications or an EGD procedure within 3 yr were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endpoints for EGD-improving management were prospectively defined: change in medical therapy, dilating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), finding severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (Hetzel-Dent grade 3 or 4), or finding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and six patients (59 M/147 F; median age, 48 yr) were enrolled, in which, 124 had alarm symptoms and 82 had persistent heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EGD improved the overall management in 40% of patients with alarm symptoms and 29% with persistent heartburn (p= NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Medical therapy was altered in only 5% of patients, and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EGD was more likely to improve management in males with alarm symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It was uncommon for an EGD to alter antireflux therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The management was improved in approximately one-third of the patients by dilating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, finding BE to initiate surveillance, or finding severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>EGD should be performed when alarm symptoms are present, especially in males </plain></SENT>
