<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As definitive diagnosis requires costly endoscopic investigation, we sought to develop a risk prediction model to aid in deciding which patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms to refer for endoscopic screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included data from patients with incident nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 285) and endoscopy control patients with esophageal inflammatory changes without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> ("<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> controls", n = 313) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used two phases of stepwise backwards logistic regression to identify the important predictors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> in men and women separately: first, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significant covariates from univariate analyses and then fitting non-significant covariates from univariate analyses to identify those effects detectable only after adjusting for other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final model pooled these predictors and was externally validated for discrimination and calibration using data from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> study conducted in western Washington State </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The final risk model included terms for age, sex, smoking status, body mass index, highest level of education, and frequency of use of acid suppressant medications (area under the ROC curve, 0.70; 95%CI, 0.66-0.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The model had moderate discrimination in the external dataset (area under the ROC curve, 0.61; 95%CI, 0.56-0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model was well calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, P = 0.75), with predicted probability and observed risk highly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prediction model performed reasonably well and has the potential to be an effective and useful clinical tool in selecting patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms to refer for endoscopic screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
