<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Although minimally invasive surgical approaches to esophagectomy have been reported since 1992, MIE is still considered investigational at most institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective study evaluates 104 MIE procedures performed between August 1998 and September 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures include operative techniques, operative times, blood loss, length of stay, conversion rates, morbidities, and mortalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Indications for surgery were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> (n = 80), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 6), recalcitrant stricture (n = 8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100723'>gastrointestinal stromal tumor</z:hpo> (n = 3), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333763" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastric cardia cancer</z:e> (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical approaches included thoracoscopic/laparoscopic esophagectomy with a cervical anastomosis (n = 47), minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (n = 51), laparoscopic hand-assisted blunt transhiatal esophagectomy (n = 5), and laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 77 males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients (2.9%) required conversion to a laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median ICU and hospital stays were 2 and 8 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Major complications occurred in 12.5% of patients and minor complications in 15.4% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of leak was 9.6% and of anastomotic stricture was 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality was 1.9% with an in-hospital mortality of 2.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean number of lymph nodes retrieved was 13.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive esophagectomy is feasible with a low conversion rate, acceptable morbidity, and low mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our preferred operative approach is the laparoscopic\thoracoscopic Ivor Lewis resection, which provides a tension-free intrathoracic anastomosis </plain></SENT>
