<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some genetic alterations known to promote cellular proliferation and induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> also may participate in an intrinsic inflammatory pathway that produces a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-promoting inflammatory microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about this intrinsic inflammatory pathway in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used a series of nontransformed and transformed human Barrett's epithelial cell lines developed in our laboratory to explore the potential contribution of interleukin (IL)-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) (key molecules in the intrinsic inflammatory pathway) to Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined IL-6 mRNA expression and protein secretion and protein expression of activated phospho-STAT3 and its downstream target myeloid cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (mcl)-1 (Mcl-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used an IL-6 blocking antibody and two JAK kinase inhibitors (AG490 and JAK inhibitor I) to assess whether STAT3 activation is IL-6 dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also used small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (siRNAs) to STAT3 and Mcl-1 to assess effects of STAT3 pathway inhibition on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phospho-STAT3 was expressed only by transformed Barrett's cells, which also exhibited higher levels of IL-6 mRNA and of IL-6 and Mcl-1 proteins than nontransformed Barrett's cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>STAT3 phosphorylation could be blocked by IL-6 blocking antibody and by AG490 and JAK inhibitor I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In transformed Barrett's cells, rates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> were significantly increased by transfection with siRNAs for STAT3 and Mcl-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that activation of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway in transformed Barrett's epithelial cells enables them to resist <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate a possible contribution of the intrinsic inflammatory pathway to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
