<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operability was 98.5% and resectability 95.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No postoperative or hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathologic staging was as follows: stage 0 and I, 38.3%; stage II, 20.6%; stage III, 22.2%; and stage IV, 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survivals were 80.5% at 1 year, 62.7% at 2 years, and 58.2% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival for patients with stage I disease was 100%; for stage II, 87.5%; for stage III, 22.2%; and for stage IV, 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four (51.5%) patients were under surveillance for a related or unrelated condition before diagnosis of their <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; only nine (26.5%) had diseased lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 32 the diagnosis was made at their first medical contact, and 78% of them had diseased lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival without nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> was 85.3% and significantly better than for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, 38.3% (p = 0.0033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 66 patients, 19 (28.7%) had a biopsy-proved history of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean time interval between diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and degeneration was 3.8 years (89.5% &gt; 1 year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Over the surveillance period, the length of metaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> remained unchanged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Barrett's ulceration was present from the beginning in 14 patients, and three patients never had an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was seen in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Resected specimens revealed severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 patients, 73.7% had stage I disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that close endoscopic monitoring and systematic biopsies of the smallest irregularities in the metaplastic mucosa may result in early detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In this respect, patients with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> within a zone of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> seem to be at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Early detection increases substantially the chances for cure by diminishing the risks of lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Resection remains the treatment of choice in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> including high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, because mortality can be kept low with excellent to very good functional results in the majority of the patients provided the intervention is performed by experienced teams </plain></SENT>
