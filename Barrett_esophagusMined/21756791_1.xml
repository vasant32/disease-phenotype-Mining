<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic values of GerdQ questionnaire, 24-h pH monitoring and 24-h impedance-pH monitoring for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) and to analyze the reflux patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE) and non-erosive disease (NERD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 1, 2009 to September 30, 2010, 205 GERD patients were included according to the Montreal consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were surveyed by a GerdQ questionnaire and underwent 24-h impedance-pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic sensitivities of GerdQ, 24-h pH-DeM and 24-h <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-pH were compared and the reflux pattern of BE, RE and NERD analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 205 GERD patients including 10 BE, 28 RE and 167 NERD were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(1) The diagnostic rate of 24-h <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-pH was 74.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was significantly higher than that of GerdQ (51.7%) and 24-h pH-DeM (29.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) The diagnostic sensitivities of GerdQ and 24-h pH-DeM for BE and RE were higher than that for NERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But there were no significant differences of 24-h <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-pH for three types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (70.0%, 82.1% and 73.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(3) There were positive correlations among the scores of GerdQ, pH-DeM scores and acid scores in <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-pH (r = 0.242, P = 0.000; r = 0.182, P = 0.009 and r = 0.632, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(4) Added diagnostic values of <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-pH were 58.5% and 74.5% respectively in patients who would have been missed by GerdQ and pH-DeM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(5) The detection rate and score of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> in RE patients were higher than that of NERD [53.6% vs 23.4%, P &lt; 0.05; 45.6 (35.0 - 67.5) vs 23.1 (9.3 - 35.0), P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>But gas score and separate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> were lower than that in NERD [17 (0 - 194) vs 30 (0 - 500), P &lt; 0.05; 57.4% vs 28.6%, P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">Acid reflux</z:e> plays an important role in RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The value of GerdQ and 24-h pH-DeM and 24-h <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-pH monitoring were similar for the diagnosis of RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Weak acid may be more important for BE and NERD patients than separate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>And 24-h <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-pH monitoring has a distinct advantage in diagnosing these two types </plain></SENT>
