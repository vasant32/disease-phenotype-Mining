<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Discrepancy exists between the endoscopic (rugal folds) and the histopathologic (oxyntic mucosa) definition of proximal stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared endoscopy and histopathology of the esophagogastric junction in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 102 consecutive patients (60 women) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> prospectively underwent endoscopy including multilevel biopsy sampling at the level of the rise of rugal folds (level 0), and also 0.5 cm and 1.0 cm distal and 0.5 cm and &gt; or = 1 cm proximal to this point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Columnar lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) was cataloged according to the histopathologic Paull-Chandrasoma classification and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> according to the endoscopic Los Angeles classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was diagnosed if the endoscopic rugal folds commenced &gt; or = 2 cm above the diaphragm; competency of the esophagogastric valve was graded according to the Hill classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had histopathologic CLE with maximal presence at level 0 (97%) and a decrease towards proximal and distal biopsy levels (level -0.5 cm, 81%; level -1.0, 28%; level + 0.5 cm, 40%; level + 1.0 cm, 18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic CLE (distance between CLE-positive biopsy levels) was longer than endoscopic CLE (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 19 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (18.6%) were identified from 4-quadrant biopsies obtained at the squamocolumnar junction and at 0.5 cm distal from it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Persons with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were significantly older, had increased frequency of endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, higher Hill grade and presence of endoscopic CLE (P &lt; 0.05); no significant difference was observed regarding sex, endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or length of endoscopic and histopathologic CLE (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> the esophagogastric junction cannot be identified by endoscopy but requires histopathology of multilevel biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The squamocolumnar junction harbors the highest yield of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
