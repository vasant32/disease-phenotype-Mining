<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The dietary components responsible for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were divided into four groups based on their diet: a low soybean-oil diet, a low cow-fat diet, a high soybean-oil diet, and a high cow-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, we evaluated the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> composition of the bile juice in each group without operation, using high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because only high cow-fat intake induced changes in the composition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> in bile juice, we then selected animals fed with a low soybean-oil diet and those with a high cow-fat diet to carry out esophago-jejunostomy for reflux of the duodenal contents, and compared sequential morphological changes between these groups up to 30 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 30 weeks after surgery, the reflux animals in the high cow-fat group showed a significantly higher incidence of BE and Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> than those in the low soybean-oil group, and the incidence of EAC in the high cow-fat group was also slightly higher than that in the low soybean-oil group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High dietary animal fat changed the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile-acid</z:chebi> composition and increased the concentration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> conjugates in the bile juice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> promoted the development of BE and Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> leading to EAC </plain></SENT>
