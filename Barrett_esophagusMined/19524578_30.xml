<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcomes of patients treated endoscopically and surgically for mucosal EAC are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared long-term outcomes of patients with mucosal EAC treated endoscopically and surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients treated for mucosal EAC between 1998 and 2007 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into an endoscopically treated group (ENDO group) and a surgically treated group (SURG group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vital status information was queried using an institutionally approved internet research and location service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 178 patients were included, of whom 132 (74%) were in the ENDO group and 46 (26%) were in the SURG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 64 months (standard error of the mean, 4.8 mo) in the SURG group and 43 months (standard error of the mean, 2.8 mo) in the ENDO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cumulative mortality in the ENDO group (17%) was comparable with the SURG group (20%) (P = .75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall survival also was comparable using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment modality was not a significant predictor of survival on multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was detected in 12% of patients in the ENDO group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> successfully re-treated without impact on overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall survival in patients with mucosal EAC when treated endoscopically appears to be comparable with that of patients treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> occurs in a limited proportion of patients, but can be managed endoscopically </plain></SENT>
