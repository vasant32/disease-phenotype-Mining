<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed flow cytometry and cytogenetic analysis of 37 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the distal esophagus and cardia, of which 22 arose in Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of eight analyzed specimens of Barrett's mucosa had clonal chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 19 cases clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complex pattern of cytogenetic changes did not differ among the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arisen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and those in the distal esophagus without Barrett's mucosa or cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal karyotypes with multiple and complex rearrangements were seen in 11 cases and with single or a few numeric changes in eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Losses of chromosomes 4, 18, 21, and Y were the most frequent numeric changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of the Y chromosome was observed in eight of 26 tumors of males (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gains of chromosomes 14 and 20 were also frequent numeric changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Structural abnormalities were observed in 13 of the abnormal karyotypes (68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The chromosome arms most frequently rearranged were 1p, 3q, 11p and 22p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The chromosome arm most frequently contributing to losses was 1p, with the shortest region of overlap being 1p22-33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The chromosome arms most often involved in gains were 11p and 22p, and i(3q) was the isochromosome that was most frequently identified </plain></SENT>
