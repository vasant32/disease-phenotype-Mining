<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the most frequent bariatric operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this operation, the distal bypassed stomach is left in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied pre-operative clinical, endoscopic and histologic findings in a consecutive group of morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients prior to bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study was conducted from August 1999 until May 2004, which consisted of 426 patients with morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 94 men and 332 women, with mean age 39.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients prior to surgery, upper endoscopy was performed and biopsy samples were taken distal to squamo-columnar junction (cardiac biopsies), and in 232 of them also in at the antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pathological findings at the esophagus were seen in 55% of the patients, mainly related to reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was seen in 5.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the stomach, pathological findings were seen in 32% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Active <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> was demonstrated in 2.6% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the duodenum, pathologic findings were detected in 13.4% of the patients, showing an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in 2.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the stomach, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> and atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were found in 8.6% and 6.5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Antral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found in 1 patient, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid tumor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>H. pylori was present in 53% of the patients, mainly in the antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In candidates for bariatric surgery, upper endoscopy with biopsy samples and determination of H. pylori should be routinely performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>If present, H. pylori should be eradicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>After surgery, if <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was present, endoscopic surveillance is recommended </plain></SENT>
