<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Segment length and histology are used to evaluate BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The development of varying depths of ablation therapy has renewed interest in using EUS for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY: In this prospective study, EWT measurements were taken from the balloon-mucosal interface to the outer most hyper-echoic line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These measurements were correlated with the highest grade of BE <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and segment length, and then compared with the measurements from control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 2004 to 2007, 76 BE patients (69 men, mean age 68 y, 4 ND, 14 low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 52 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 6 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ) and 53 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (18 men, mean age 60 y) underwent EUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean EWT was 2.4 mm for controls, 3.1 mm for nondysplastic BE, 3.2 mm for low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 3.4 mm for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 3.9 mm for <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group of 53 patients, the mean EWT was 2.4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, the mean EWT was significantly greater in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histologic subgroups of BE patients (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant correlation was seen between EWT and BE histology grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no correlations between age, gender, or BE segment length and EWT (P=0.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EWT is greater among patients with BE compared with control patients; however, there were no systematic differences in EWT were found among BE patients, based on histology and segment length </plain></SENT>
