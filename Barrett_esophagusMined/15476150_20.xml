<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most gastroenterologists refer patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> for esophagectomy, and effective endoscopic therapies are available for nonoperative patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness of screening strategies that incorporate these nonsurgical treatment modalities has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We designed a Markov model to compare lifetime costs and life expectancy for a cohort of 50-year-old men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared 10 clinical strategies incorporating combinations of screening and surveillance protocols (no screening, screening with periodic surveillance for both dysplastic and nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, or periodic surveillance for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> only), treatment for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (esophagectomy or intensive surveillance), and treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (esophagectomy or surgical and endoscopic treatment options) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Screening and surveillance of patients with both dysplastic and nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> followed by esophagectomy for surgical candidates with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> and endoscopic therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients who were not operative candidates cost $12,140 per life-year gained compared to no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other screening strategies, including strategies that had no endoscopic treatment options, were either less effective at the same cost, or equally effective at a higher cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of screening and subsequent surveillance of patients with dysplastic as well as nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> followed by endoscopic or surgical therapy in patients who develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> compares favorably to many widely accepted screening strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
