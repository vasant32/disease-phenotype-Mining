<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical, histologic, and biologic characteristics of BE that is situated underneath squamous islands (BUSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 97 mucosal biopsies from 44 BE patients with BUSI were evaluated for a variety of histologic features (eg, type of epithelium, anatomic relationship of the underlying glands to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface, presence of adjacent mucosal glands or ducts, and the presence and degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>), and immunostained for Ki-67, cyclin D1, and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BUSI was compared with adjacent areas of BE for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clinical control group consisting of 50 BE patients without microscopic evidence of BUSI was selected for comparison of clinical and endoscopic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study group (34 males, 10 females; mean age, 67 years; mean length of BE, 5.5 cm) consisted of 27 (61%) and 12 (27%) patients on low- and high-dose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On endoscopy, visible islands of squamous mucosa were noted in only 43% of study group patients (despite the presence of BUSI microscopically in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases); one island was noted in 2%, multiple islands in 27%, and extensive islands in 14% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of squamous islands was unrelated to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study group was significantly more likely to have endoscopic evidence of extensive squamous islands compared with the control group (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologically, 89% of biopsies with BUSI showed intestinal-type, and 11% showed cardia-type, epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low- and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was noted in 4 (4%) and 5 (5%) biopsies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BUSI also showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in other areas of the esophagus as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, BUSI reached the mucosal surface either by penetrating directly through, or by wrapping around, islands of squamous epithelium, in 68% of biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one percent of biopsies showed BUSI adjacent to submucosal glands or ducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>BUSI showed a significantly lower Ki-67 proliferation rate (29% vs. 49%, P &lt; 0.001), and a lower, albeit nonsignificant, degree of cyclin D1 (16% vs. 29%) and p53 (4% vs. 17%) positivity in comparison to adjacent areas of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, significantly lower proliferation rates were observed in BUSI that did not reveal an opening to the mucosal surface in comparison to foci that did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>BUSI is phenotypically similar to typical surface BE but shows less severe proliferative abnormalities, particularly in buried glands that have no detectable connection to the esophageal lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Reduced proliferation may be due either to decreased exposure to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> contents or to disruption of sloughing of surface epithelial cells into the crypt lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies of large numbers of patients with BUSI will be required to determine the magnitude of its risk of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
