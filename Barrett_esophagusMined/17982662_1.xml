<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the wide range of reported p53 alteration frequencies in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> makes using p53 as a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the utility of p53 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> monitoring, the frequency of p53 alteration was critically reassessed using esophagectomy specimens of 40 cases of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, including 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 8 with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 7 with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells isolated by laser capture microdissection to maximize the assay sensitivity and mutations in exons 4-8 of p53 were determined by PCR direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in p53 were identified in 75% (30/40) of the esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p53 protein overexpression, detected by immunohistochemistry, was found in 58% (23/40) of the esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 60% (6/10) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 12% (1/8) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the mutations, a predominance of the 72Arg allele (89% homozygous) was found over the 72Pro allele in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>p53 mutation frequency in this study was higher than reported in most of the literature and DNA sequencing detected more p53 alterations than immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, p53 appeared to be a late marker in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e>, and no p53 change was found in approximately 25% of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that p53 is insufficient as a single marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> monitoring but may be useful as part of a panel due to its high specificity </plain></SENT>
