<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecular pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that at a phenotypic level, the metaplastic process begins with the transformation of squamous epithelium in the distal esophagus to cardiac mucosa, which subsequently becomes intestinalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The homeobox gene Cdx-2 has been shown to be an important transcriptional regulator of embryonic differentiation and maintenance of adult intestinal type epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that Cdx-2 gene expression levels increase with the phenotypic transformation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa to the intestinalized columnar mucosa of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic biopsies were obtained at the gastroesophageal junction in patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and classified according to histology: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa (n = 62), cardiac mucosa (n = 19), oxynto-cardiac mucosa (n = 14), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Duodenal biopsies (n = 26) served as the columnar control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After laser capture microdissection and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolation, gene expression levels of Cdx-2 were measured in each tissue type by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with its known function, Cdx-2 gene expression levels were highest in duodenal mucosa and nearly absent in squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a stepwise increase in Cdx-2 gene expression from cardiac to Barrett's epithelium (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of Cdx-2 in cardiac and oxynto-cardiac mucosa were 40-70 times higher and Barrett's mucosa 400 times higher than that found in squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relative expression of the homeobox gene Cdx-2, known to induce differentiation of intestinal type epithelium, increases in a stepwise fashion during the phenotypic transformation of distal esophageal squamous mucosa to cardiac columnar mucosa and to the intestinalized columnar mucosa of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Cdx-2 may be a potential biomarker to detect the early transition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
