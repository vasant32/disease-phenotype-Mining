<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Surgical control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) is a challenging problem especially in neurologically impaired children and in acquired GER patients after caustic insult to the esophagus because of high failure rates of the classical antireflux procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A surgical technique has been designed to overcome this high relapse incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the past 75 months, 39 children between 4 months and 14 years of age underwent a gastric tube cardioplasty fashioned from the lesser curvature as the antireflux barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the preoperative RI values of 72 to 10 (average, 32) fell to 0 to 5 (average, 2) after the described procedure, and, in the follow-up period of 2 to 75 months, the RI values did not deteriorate in any one of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that a 6-cm antireflux barrier (HPZ) created from the lesser curvature of the stomach is enough to control GER at any age </plain></SENT>
