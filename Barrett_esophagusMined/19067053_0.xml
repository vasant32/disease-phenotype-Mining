<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Precise endoscopic assessment of the gastroesophageal junction is of utter importance, especially regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There has been a lack of a validated definition of the endoscopic gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients scheduled for resection of the gastroesophageal junction were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, gastroscopy was performed and the gastroesophageal junction was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If there was disparity between the endoscopic gastroesophageal junction and the Z-line, the gastroesophageal junction was marked with India ink tattooing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively the resection specimens were evaluated and the anatomical gastroesophageal junction was compared with the endoscopic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients the measured difference between the gastroesophageal junction and the endoscopic junction was &lt;5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The upper margin of the longitudinal folds of the stomach can be used as an appropriate endoscopic definition of the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
