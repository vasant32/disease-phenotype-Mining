<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neuroendocrine differentiation is common in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the stomach and colon and may be associated with a slightly better prognosis in <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied neuroendocrine differentiation in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) to determine association with patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight cases of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (15 biopsies, 43 resections) from 52 patients were stained with a monoclonal antibody to chromogranin (CG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, response to therapy, and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients received radiation and chemotherapy, and four received radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 58 (20.7%) esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> contained scattered CG-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> with CG-positive cells were moderately to poorly differentiated, and many consisted of large cribriform glands, similar to intestinal-type <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case of small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus was weakly CG positive; another was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuroendocrine differentiation was retained in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> in two cases but lost in three other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 10 CG-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> were also negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For five of six patients with paired biopsy/resection specimens, no CG-positive cells were seen in either specimen; one patient had CG-positive cells only in the resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage at surgery or survival time between CG-positive and CG-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BE was present in 34 cases and contained CG-positive cells in 21 of 34 (61.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> contained CG-positive cells in 11 of 14 cases (78.6%) and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 3 of 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 21 (66.7%) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> associated with CG-positive BE were negative for CG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In summary, neuroendocrine differentiation is common in BE and is retained in low- and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> but is usually lost in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The presence of scattered neuroendocrine cells does not affect patient outcome </plain></SENT>
