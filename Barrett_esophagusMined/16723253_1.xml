<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that long-term re-epithelialisation, which has been achieved following ablation using 5-aminolaevulinic acid (5-ALA) photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) may reduce the risk of malignant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known whether <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> modifies oesophageal motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess oesophageal pH and motility before and after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> ablation in treated and untreated areas of the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients (10 male) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, median segment length 4 cm, were treated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours pH assessment and oesophageal manometry were performed before and 4-6 weeks after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was carried out using 635 nm red light, 4-6h after administration of 30 mg/kg 5-ALA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proximal (untreated) and distal (treated) oesophageal resting pressure, wave amplitude, percentage peristalsis and percentage study time oesophageal pH&lt;4, were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">Proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) were administered throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in oesophageal motility in treated or untreated areas of the oesophagus after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> compared to pre-treatment values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who continued to experience oesophageal acid exposure required more treatments to achieve complete Barrett's ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oesophageal motility following ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> suggests a trend toward enhanced wave propagation however continued oesophageal acid exposure may affect <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> efficacy </plain></SENT>
