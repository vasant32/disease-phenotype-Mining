<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE) provides an alternative, minimally invasive modality for evaluating the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the performance and test characteristics of a second-generation esophageal capsule endoscope, the PillCam ESO 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adults with known or suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the simplified ingestion procedure, each patient underwent capsule endoscopy with the PillCam ESO 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following ECE, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed on the same day by an investigator who was blinded to the results of the ECE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In random order, capsule endoscopy videos were read and interpreted by the study investigator blinded to EGD results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 28 patients (19 men, 9 women; mean age 53.3 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 82 % of the patients, at least 75 % of the Z line was visualized by the PillCam ESO 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A per-lesion analysis demonstrated that the PillCam ESO 2 had definitive results in 30/43 lesions (69.8 %) and EGD in 29/43 (67.4 %), P value = 0.41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with EGD for detecting suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, the PillCam ESO 2 had a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 74 %, and a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 87 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The PillCam ESO 2 demonstrated 86 % agreement with EGD in describing the Z line (kappa statistic 0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The modified ingestion protocol provided excellent cleansing, with bubbles/saliva having no or only a minor effect on Z line images in 86 % of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PillCam ESO 2 demonstrated excellent visualization of the Z line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared with standard EGD, the PillCam ESO 2 had good test characteristics with high rates of detection of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study provides indirect validation of the simplified ingestion procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The PillCam ESO 2 acquires high quality esophageal images, performs safely, and should be able to replace the current PillCam ESO </plain></SENT>
