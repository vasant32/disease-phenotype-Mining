<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: It is assumed that esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is the end result of a stepwise disease process that transitions through <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine at what stage known risk factors exert their influence toward the progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 113 consecutive outpatients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, 188 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, 162 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and 100 with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a standard upper endoscopy and completed a standardized questionnaire about their social history, symptoms, dietary habits, and prescribed medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used adjusted logistic regression analysis to assess risk factors between each two consecutive disease stages from the absence of reflux disease to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, male gender, smoking, <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased body mass index</z:mp> (BMI), low fruit and vegetable intake, duration of reflux symptoms, and presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> were risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>/HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, different combinations of risk factors were associated with different disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was the only risk factor to be strongly associated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients, male gender, age, an <z:mp ids='MP_0006087'>increased BMI</z:mp>, duration of reflux symptoms, and presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>/HGD among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was associated with male gender, smoking, decreased fruit and vegetable intake, and a long segment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but not with age, BMI, or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While some risk factors act predominantly on the initial development of reflux disease, others appear to be primarily responsible for the development of more advanced disease stages </plain></SENT>
