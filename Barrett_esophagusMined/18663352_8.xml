<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed genome-wide analysis of copy-number changes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to identify associated genomic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA from 27 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and 14 matching <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues was subjected to SNP microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed using dChipSNP software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Copy-number changes occurring in at least 25% of the cases and LOH occurring in at least 19% were regarded as relevant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a validation, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of 8q24.21 (CMYC) and 8p23.1 (SOX7) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previously described genomic alterations in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> could be confirmed by SNP microarrays, such as amplification on 8q (CMYC, confirmed by FISH) and 20q13 or deletion/LOH on 3p (FHIT) and 9p (CDKN2A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, frequent gains were detected on 2p23.3, 7q11.22, 13q31.1, 14q32.31, 17q23.2 and 20q13.2 harboring several novel candidate genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest copy numbers were seen on 8p23.1, the location of SOX7, which could be demonstrated to be involved in amplification by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A nuclear overexpression of the transcription factor SOX7 could be detected by immunohistochemistry in two amplified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Copy-number losses were seen on 18q21.32 and 20p11.21, harboring interesting candidate genes, such as CDH20 and CST4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, a novel LOH region could be identified on 6p in at least 19% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, SNP microarrays are a valuable tool to detect DNA copy-number changes and LOH at a high resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using this technique, we identified several novel genes and DNA regions associated with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
