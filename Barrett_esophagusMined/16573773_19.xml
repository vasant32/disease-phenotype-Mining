<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Medications that may increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> could be risk factors for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; however, epidemiologic studies present conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated patients with a high-risk condition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, to identify risk factors that may act early in the carcinogenic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study within a large integrated health-services organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electronic databases were used to identify incident diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (cases); two controls were matched to each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electronic databases provided information on the use of medications that may induce reflux (nitrates, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthines</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi>, and beta <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>) and potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A supplemental mailed questionnaire evaluated additional potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 421 cases and selected 842 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between any medication use and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosis was modified by age; an increased risk was observed only among subjects &lt;70 yr of age (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-4.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosis was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> medication use (OR 5.8; 95% CI 2.2, 14.9), but not with the other medications studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses suggested that medication use was not independently associated with reflux symptoms and that adjustment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> symptoms substantially reduced the association between medication use and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of medications that may induce reflux was associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosis among younger persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This association was only observed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> medications; the analyses suggested the possibility of confounding by indication, whereby reflux may cause both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
