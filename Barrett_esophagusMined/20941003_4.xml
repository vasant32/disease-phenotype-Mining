<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the autofluorescence signal arises from the superficial tissue layer due to the short penetration depth of the ultraviolet excitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result, visualization of esophageal epithelial cells and their organization can be attained using wide-field autofluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show tryptophan to be the dominant source of emission under 266 nm excitation, while emission from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> and collagen are dominant under 355 nm excitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of multispectral microscopy images reveals that tryptophan offers the highest image contrast due to its non-uniform distribution in the sub-cellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This technique can simultaneously provide functional and structural imaging of the microstructure using only the intrinsic tissue fluorophores </plain></SENT>
