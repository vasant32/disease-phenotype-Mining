<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The promoter of somatostatin (SST), a primary inhibitor of gastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion, is hypermethylated in 80% of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to investigate whether and at what stage promoter hypermethylation of SST is involved in human esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SST promoter hypermethylation was examined by real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (MSP) in 260 human esophageal tissue specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR and MSP were also performed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> cell lines before and after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (5-Aza-dC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SST hypermethylation showed highly discriminative receiver-operator characteristic curve profiles, clearly distinguishing esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (EAC) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (NE) (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both SST methylation frequency and normalized methylation value (NMV) were significantly higher in Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or EAC (BE), low-grade and high-grade (HGD) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> occurring in BE, EAC, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> than in NE (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SST hypermethylation frequency was significantly lower in NE (9%) than in BE (70%), HGD (71.4%), or EAC (71.6%), whereas 14 (53.8%) of 26 ESCCs exhibited SST hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant relation between SST hypermethylation and BE segment length, a known clinical risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Demethylation of KYSE220 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> and OE33 EAC cells with 5-Aza-dC reduced SST methylation and increased SST <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SST <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in native unmethylated EACs were significantly higher than in native methylated EACs (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SST promoter hypermethylation is a common event in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> and is related to early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
