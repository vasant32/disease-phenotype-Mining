<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative manometric and pH studies revealed that the patient had a cardiac incompetence and a delayed acid clearance of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic biopsies between 33-35 cm from the incisors, above the gastroesophageal junction, showed columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> with a villiform surface, mucous glands, intestinal goblet cells, moderate inflammatory changes and focal mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the operation, relief of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and reflux symptoms were obtained successfully, and an endoscopy done 7 months later demonstrated that the esophageal lumen was adequate enough for passage, and that there was improvement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, though persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> still existed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the fundic patch operation with the formation of a mucosal valve and 270 degrees fundoplication is a useful method of choice for benign strictures of the lower esophagus </plain></SENT>
