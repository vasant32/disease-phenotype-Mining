<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six specimens from 25 patients with Barrett's epithelium were analyzed by both histology and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 73 were without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 13 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (7 low grade, 6 high grade) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight of the nondysplastic specimens were aneuploid and another 15 had increased G2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the dysplastic specimens, two were aneuploid and two had increased G2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were grouped into four classifications: type 1 (65 specimens), specialized columnar epithelium (Barrett's) without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and no <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>; type 2 (8 specimens), Barrett's epithelium without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and an aneuploid cell population; type 3 (11 specimens), Barrett's epithelium with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and no <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>; and type 4 (2 specimens), Barrett's epithelium with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distribution by type was 76%, 9%, 13%, and 2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that histologic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> are often discordant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They may identify separate subgroups at risk, or when concordant, may reflect an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in that population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further study will define the role of histology and flow cytometry in the screening and management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
