<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: The incidence of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is increasing rapidly and this may be related to the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have distinguished two subtypes of IM at the GOJ: short segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (SSBO) and IM at a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamo-columnar junction (IMNSCJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because abnormal expression of cell cycle regulators is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous states</z:e>, cell cycle regulation was studied in patients with IM at the GOJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsy samples and resected materials were identified from patients with SSBO (10), IMNSCJ (14), a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SCJ with (14) and without (12) <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) (12), and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sections were stained with antibodies to p21, p27, p53, Ki67, cyclin D1, and c-erbB2 and were assessed independently by two observers, using predetermined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> showed high expression of c-erbB2, p53, p27, and Ki67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with BO showed expression of c-erbB2 but little expression of other markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Greatly increased expression of cyclin D1 was seen in patients with IMNSCJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other markers was similar in patients with IMNSCJ and those with SSBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 and c-erbB-2 were coexpressed in patients with SSBO and IMNSCJ, and their expression was associated with the presence of p53 and p21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the proposed aetiologies of SSBO (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e>) and IMNSCJ (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo>) differ, the cell cycle response is similar and both may have malignant potential </plain></SENT>
