<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>G-Gly stimulated proliferation in OE19 and OE33 cells in a dose-dependant manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was unaffected by a CCK2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> but abolished by COX-2 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>G-Gly induced proliferation, COX-2 mRNA abundance, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> secretion, were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abolished by inhibition of JAK2, PI3-kinase, Akt or NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>G-Gly stimulated phosphorylation of JAK2 and increased PI3-kinase activity in JAK2 immunoprecipitates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>G-Gly increased Akt phosphorylation and kinase activity and NF-kappaB reporter activity in a JAK2-, PI3-kinase- and Akt-sensitive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G-Gly increased COX-2 promoter transcription in an Akt and NF-kappaB-dependent manner and also reduced COX-2 mRNA degradation in an Akt-insensitive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that G-Gly induced signalling involves a JAK2/PI3-kinase/Akt/NF-kappaB sequence leading to COX-2 transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>G-Gly also seems to stabilise COX-2 mRNA via a separate pathway </plain></SENT>
