<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the long-term symptom control after laparoscopic fundoplication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), and possible prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 271 patients, operated on at a university hospital from 1996 through 2002, was eligible for evaluation after a median interval of 102 months (range = 12-158) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time between surgery and recurrence of reflux symptoms (i.e., time to treatment failure) served as the end point for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Putative risk factors for symptom recurrence were analyzed by univariate analysis and by using Cox's multiple-hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to Kaplan-Meier estimates, the rate of reflux symptom recurrence was 15 % after 108 months, 11 % in cases without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, but 43 % in patients with long-segment (≥ 3 cm) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reflux symptoms recurred in 22 % of cases with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (HH) ≥ 3 cm before operation, but only in 7 % with smaller or absent HH (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed a relative risk of 6.6 (CI = 3.0-13.0) for long-segment BE and 3.0 (CI = 1.7-10.1) for HH ≥ 3 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A strong statistical interaction was found between HH ≥ 3 cm and long-segment BE: the small group (n = 18) of cases exhibiting both risk factors had an exaggerated recurrence rate of 72 % at 108 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic fundoplication for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> provided a long-lasting abolition of reflux symptoms in 231 of 271 (85 %) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HH ≥ 3 cm and long-segment BE were shown as independent prognostic factors favoring recurrence </plain></SENT>
