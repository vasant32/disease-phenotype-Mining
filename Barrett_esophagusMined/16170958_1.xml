<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in non-selected patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE) and identified risk factors associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case-control study on patients who underwent UGE between 2001-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic data was gathered as well as the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, H. pylori, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> presence and length, nighttime symptoms, smoking, and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The global frequency of EB was 0.26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average age in patients with EB was 57.3 +/- 17 years old against 49 +/- 15 years old on the control group (p = 0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>69% of the patients with EB were men compared to 56% on the control group (p = 0.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference regarding the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was found between EB (79.6%) and patients without EB (72.5%) (p = 0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, patients with EB presented a longer <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference regarding the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (p = 0.32), H. pylori (p = 0.61), smoking (p = 0.39), alcohol consumption (p = 0.34), nocturnal symptoms (p = 0.53) or extra-esophageal manifestations (p = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant difference existed regarding the presence of heartburn and the length of symptoms: patients with EB stated a history longer than 5 years in comparison with the control group (p &lt; 0.005 and &lt; 0.01 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of EB was 0.26% in Mexican non-selected population; the extents of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and history heartburn as well as a longer duration of symptoms were significantly associated to EB </plain></SENT>
