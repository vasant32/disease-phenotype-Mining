<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is useful for detecting depth of invasion and nodal involvement in patients with early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (EBN), precluding endoscopic management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine whether the lesion <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the EBN shown on high-resolution endoscopy predicts EUS and histologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective series from two tertiary referral centers were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with EBN referred for EUS evaluation before treatment were identified, and data were collected from endoscopies, a database, and case notes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had high-resolution endoscopy followed by radial EUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study included 50 patients (22 men) with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range, 60-79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visible lesions in the Barrett's segment were described as Paris types 0-1 (n = 9), 0-IIb (n = 12), 0-IIa (n = 12), 0-IIa + IIc (n = 6), and 0-IIc (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 50 patients, 46 (92%) had either EMR (n = 17), esophagectomy (n = 23), or both (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients (100%) with Paris 0-IIb lesions had T0/T1 m staging on EUS confirmed with resection histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for EUS T-staging for Paris classification was 71.4% for type 0-I, 100% for type 0-IIb, 83% for type 0-IIa, 66.7% for type 0-IIa + IIc, and 66.7% for type IIc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, 8 (17%) of the 46 patients were understaged and 2 (4%) were overstaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For detecting submucosal invasion, EUS had a sensitivity of 66%, a specificity of 93%, a negative predictive value of 85%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 84.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Submucosal invasion is detected by EUS for 26% of patients with EBN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The value of EUS staging before resection for type 0-IIb early Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (flat lesions) is limited because 100% of these lesions are limited to the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For the management algorithm in this selected cohort, the use of EUS should be reconsidered </plain></SENT>
