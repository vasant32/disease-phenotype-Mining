<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this observational nonrandomized study this molecular environment was compared in matched asymptomatic cohorts who had undergone either fundoplication or therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Asymptomatic patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had endoscopic biopsy specimens taken from 2 cm below the squamocolumnar junction for measurement of activated NF-kappaB and a panel of cytokines and growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were recruited (surgical: n = 18, medical: n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean patient age was 51 years, and the mean follow-up period was 5.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the length of Barrett's segment and endoscopic and histopathologic features in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean activated NF-kappaB p50 and p65 subunits, interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, and interleukin-8 levels, were significantly (P &lt; .05) lower in the surgically treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides proxy support to the thesis that antireflux surgery may provide an environment that is less inflammatory and tumorigenic than that observed in medically treated patients </plain></SENT>
