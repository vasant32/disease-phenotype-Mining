<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Case-control studies in the United States and Europe have linked occupational exposure to volatile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26835">sulfur compounds</z:chebi>, solvents, and <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> to increased risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association between occupational exposures and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is unclear given the absence of studies in this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a case-control study in patients undergoing endoscopy who were either referred directly or were eligible for screening colonoscopy and recruited from primary care clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants completed a survey on (1) self-reported occupational exposures to asbestos, metal dust, organic solvents, and pesticides, and (2) self reported longest held job and job-related activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter were assigned by an industrial hygienist who was blinded to the case and control status into one of 99 standard occupational categories used by the US Department of Labor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each occupational category was then assigned an expected level of exposure to the same four classes of agents in addition to radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared the self-reported exposure and the expected occupational exposure based on the self-reported occupation between cases with definitive BE and controls without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We examined the associations adjusting for age, sex, race, and patient recruitment source in a multivariable logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We examined 226 cases of definitive BE and 1,424 controls without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a greater proportion of patients with self-reported asbestos exposure in cases than controls (16.2 % vs. 12.0 %; p = 0.08) but no significant differences in metal dust, organic solvents, or pesticides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The multivariate model did not show an independent association between self-reported asbestos exposure and BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the calculated occupational exposure, there were no significant differences between cases and controls for asbestos (29.6 % vs. 27.5 %; p = 0.5), metal dust, organic solvents, pesticides, or radiation exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among commonly reported occupation, there were significantly greater proportion of retail sales workers in BE cases than controls (10.8 % vs. 4.9 %; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to asbestos and sedentary jobs may be risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm this finding </plain></SENT>
