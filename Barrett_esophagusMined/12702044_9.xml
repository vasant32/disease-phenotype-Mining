<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Surveillance endoscopy has been advocated for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> but the cost-effectiveness of this has been questioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to identify an optimum surveillance protocol by examining if macroscopic markers at diagnosis predict the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample was 353 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> undergoing surveillance by a community-based group of gastroenterologists between 1981 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis the presence of macroscopic and microscopic markers was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence and pattern of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was documented during subsequent surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-three patients (71% male) underwent regular surveillance over 19 056 patient-months (median 42 months), having a median number of three surveillance endoscopies (range 1-40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (seven male) developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (1/176 patient years) and four male patients developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (1/397 patient years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve of these 13 patients entered with one or more macroscopic markers: severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, nodularity, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> or stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> risk was associated with macroscopic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who entered with one marker were 6.7 times more likely to develop high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (HR = 6.7, 95% CI = 1.3, 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who entered with two or more markers were 14 times more likely to develop high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (HR = 14.1, 95% CI = 2.02, 102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, nodularity or stricture at entry indicates a high-risk group for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cost-effectiveness of surveillance for these patients and those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at entry would thus improve </plain></SENT>
