<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to prospectively evaluate the prevalence of multilayered epithelium in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mucosal biopsies were obtained from the squamocolumnar junction (Z-line) of 58 patients with endoscopic evidence of esophageal columnar epithelium and from the gastroesophageal junction in 21 patients without endoscopic evidence of esophageal columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens were evaluated for the presence of multilayered epithelium and goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four of 58 (41%) of the patients with endoscopic evidence of esophageal columnar epithelium had multilayered epithelium compared with only one of 21 patients (5%) in the control group (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 58 patients in the study group, 43 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath> and 15 did not (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath> had multilayered epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Shorter lengths of columnar epithelium were noted in the 24 patients with goblet cells and multilayered epithelium compared with the 19 patients with goblet cells and no multilayered epithelium (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multilayered epithelium is strongly associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath> in patients with endoscopic evidence of esophageal columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data support the hypothesis that multilayered epithelium may represent a transitional stage in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
