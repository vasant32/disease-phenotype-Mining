<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Alcohol is a carcinogen that may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) through direct contact with esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have investigated this association and findings have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine the association between measures of total and beverage-specific alcohol consumption and BE risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a large population-based case-control study that collected information on lifetime alcohol consumption and other exposures from 285 patients with nondysplastic BE, 108 patients with dysplastic BE, and two separate control groups: 313 endoscopy patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory changes ("<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> controls") and 644 population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for categories of average alcohol consumption using unconditional multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to life-long nondrinkers and consumption of &lt;1 drink/week, consumption of 7-20 drinks/week (OR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.31-0.91) and 21-41 drinks/week (OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.19-0.73) of total alcohol throughout the life was inversely associated with nondysplastic BE, for comparisons with population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lifetime total alcohol consumption was also inversely associated with dysplastic BE (7-20 drinks/week OR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.19-1.43; 21-41 drinks/week OR=0.22, 95% CI: 0.07-0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, reduced risk estimates were found for comparisons with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inverse associations were observed separately for beer and wine consumption, with a significant linear trend observed with beer consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risks associated with liquor consumption were up to twofold higher; however, they were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence for effect modification by factors known (or suspected) to cause BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, alcohol consumption does not increase the risk of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant inverse associations were observed for beer consumption, the underlying reasons for which remain unclear </plain></SENT>
