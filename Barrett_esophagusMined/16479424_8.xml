<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While surveillance of people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, its usual precursor, has been advocated in order to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in those considered to be at greatest risk, the impact of such a strategy on survival from oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the effect of surveillance on mortality from oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in a group of patients considered to be at high risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: After performing a Medline search of the literature published between 1985 and 2004 for studies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, we examined the impact of surveillance on mortality from oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in a hypothetical sample of 100 high-risk patients (men aged over 50 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> but without high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at entry) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients in this high-risk group developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> during surveillance, with survival rates of 78.9% (95%CI 64.9%-88.5%) at 2 years and 78.6% (95%CI 62.8%-89.2%) at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, between 515 and 2060 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were not detected or surveyed by this strategy and between 16 and 61 of these developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, with much lower survival rates of 37.1% (95%CI 25.4%-50.3%) at 2 years and 16.7% (95%CI 9%-28.3%) at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although surveillance in the high-risk group resulted in the long-term survival of three patients who would not otherwise have survived, this gain was dramatically offset by the 13 to 51 patients, excluded from surveillance by this strategy, who died from oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A surveillance programme based on current concepts of risk cannot have an impact on mortality from oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To be effective, it will be necessary for surveillance programmes to utilise more precise methods for the identification of those who are most at risk of progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
