<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on 313 consecutive subjects referred for endoscopy, pH-metry, and esophageal manometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into four groups: Group I (n=92), subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pH-metry, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and without reflux symptoms; Group II (n=111), patients with NERD (no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, abnormal pH-metry); Group III (n=77), patients with mild to moderate ERD (LA A, B; abnormal pH-metry); Group IV (n=33), patients with severe or complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (LA C, D; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data are expressed as medians with 5th-95th percentiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference was found in the amount of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> between patients with mild to moderate ERD and those with NERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DeMeester score was 34.5 (17-105) in NERD patients and 31.6 (15-102) in ERD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between NERD and ERD patients regarding lower esophageal sphincter (LES) basal pressure (11.6 mmHg; 3-25 in NERD versus 10.7 mmHg; 3-22 in ERD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar proportions of patients with NERD and ERD had low LES basal pressure (20.7% in NERD versus 24.7% in ERD; NS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> (44% and 56%; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A relatively high proportion of patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (Group I) had ineffective esophageal motility (39%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No difference was found between NERD and mild to moderate ERD in terms of acid exposure time and esophageal motor abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To a certain extent, ERD is a "more complicated" form of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Host factors related to a particular patient (e.g. mucosal defense, genetics, acid clearance) might be responsible for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
