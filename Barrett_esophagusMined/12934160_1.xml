<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inevitable loss of the gastric reservoir leaves an unresolved functional problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distal esophageal resection combined with a short jejunal interposition might be a safe alternative with the advantage of better functional results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this series, 12 or more months after limited surgery for early Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> 8 patients underwent functional investigation by alimentary scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activity of a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-labeled bolus passing through the esophagus and the jejunal interposition into the stomach was consecutively measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to 11 healthy controls the transit through the tubular esophagus showed no significant delay; transit time, however, increased with a bolus-induced dilation of the jejunal interposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The length of the transit time through the jejunal interposition correlated with the length of the jejunal segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The delay of bolus passage into the stomach did not result in substantial symptoms in jejunal segments shorter than 12 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Propulsive activity within the jejunal interposition resulted in a bolus transport into the stomach without any reflux to the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate good transport function and reflux prevention of short jejunal segments interposed between the esophagus and the stomach </plain></SENT>
