<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, the transcriptional levels of components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint (important in ensuring precise chromosome segregation) were examined in Barrett's lesions and correlated with the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> present in the tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene expression levels of the MAD2 and BUB1 mitotic spindle checkpoint genes were assessed in 37 Barrett's patients (with histology ranging from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the transcriptional levels of HSP27 were also examined as firstly, its expression is known to be down regulated in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM) and thus was included as a positive control for the real-time RT-PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While, secondly, the expression pattern of this gene during Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> was investigated, as this has not been previously assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both over and under expression of the MAD2 and BUB1 mitotic spindle checkpoint genes were detected at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Barrett's histological stages with no apparent selective trend with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, no correlation with <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was established, indicating an alternative mechanism must underlie Barrett's associated <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HSP27 expression was reduced in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and then significantly increased with progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gender-related differences were observed and HSP27 expression was higher in poorly-differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> than in well-differentiated forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HSP27 transcriptional patterns therefore present potential as a prognostic tool to predict the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
