<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 108 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> picking out from 783 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients surgically treated between June 1978 to June 2001 in the Shandong Provincial Hospital and Shandong Qianfoshan Hospital were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>60Co gamma-irradiation or 6MVX-ray with conventional fraction were used for radiotherapy with a total volume dosage of 55-70 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chemotherapy was either FAM (iv infusion of 5-Fu 500 mg, d1-d5; ADM 50 mg d1; <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> 12 mg, d1) or CMF regimen (iv infusion of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> 800 mg d1, d8; MTX 30 mg d1; 5-Fu 500 mg, d1-d5) for 4-6 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier amalysis was used to estimate the survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Log rank test was used for comparison of the survival difference among different groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this series, 76 of 92 patients who underwent radical surgical resection received postoperative radiotherapy alone, and 16 received radiotherapy plus chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the other 16 patients who underwent palliative surgical resection received chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, the remaining 4 patients died of operative complications during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rate of this series was 81.5%, 51.9% and 22.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the radical resection group, it was 15.8% for the patients received radiotherapy alone versus 75.0% for those treated by chemotherapy plus radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate was 33.3% for the patients without extra-esophageal infiltration and 33.3% for the patients without lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, it was only 9.1% for the patients with extra-esophageal infiltration and 14.3% for those with lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the patients who had palliative surgical resection, though they received chemotherapy plus radiotherapy postoperatively, none of them survived longer than 5-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant difference among these groups was demonstrated by Log rank test (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy plus radiotherapy after radical surgical resection may improve the survival of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The pathological stage, extra-esophageal infiltration, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and postoperative chemotherapy plus radiotherapy are important prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
