<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication is widely used for the surgical treatment, and intrathoracic migration of the valve is the most frequent complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the incidence of the fundoplication and its risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Were analyzed retrospectively medical records of 207 patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication by the Nissen-Rossetti technique for the treatment of reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variables analyzed were: sex, age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> grade, size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e>, enlargement of the cardia and esophageal shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For quantitative variables, was considered the Student's t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the nominal, was considered the chi-square or Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P values ​​&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the total, 135 were women (65.22%) and 72 men (34.78%) with mean age of 47.43 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> varied between 2 and 6 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two hundred patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (96.62%) and 113 (56.50%) grade I, 75 grade II (37.50%) and 12 grade III or IV (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Enlargement of the cardia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were seen in 153 (73.91%) and 13 (6.28%) cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient had esophageal shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among women, 33 (24.4%) showed migration and among men, only six (8.3%) (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The average age of patients with and without migration was 54.03 and 45.89 years, respectively (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of the fundoplication migration was 18.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The gender (female) and higher age influence the probability of migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> and enlargement of the cardia were not risk factors for intrathoracic migration of the fundoplication </plain></SENT>
