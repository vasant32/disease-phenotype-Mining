<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A biopsy protocol consisting of 4 quadrant jumbo biopsies (every 1 cm) with biopsies of mucosal abnormalities (the Seattle protocol) is considered to be the optimal method for detecting early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, although it has never been validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the frequency of unsuspected <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at esophagectomy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> who underwent the Seattle protocol and to compare the findings with those of a less rigorous biopsy protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> underwent esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None had obvious mass lesions at preoperative endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into group 1 (preoperative surveillance biopsies according to Seattle protocol) and group 2 (4 quadrant biopsies every 2 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and postoperative diagnoses were confirmed by 2 expert gastrointestinal pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unsuspected intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was found in 8 of 20 (40%) patients in group 1 versus 4 of 13 (30%) in group 2 (P = .6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative mucosal nodularity was observed in 4 of 8 (50%) postoperative intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> from group 1 versus 3 of 4 (75%) from group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multifocal high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was seen preoperatively in 7 of 8 (87.5%) postoperative intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in group 1 versus 2 of 4 (50%) in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient had submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> at surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intense preoperative biopsy sampling by the Seattle protocol does not more reliably predict the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at the time of esophagectomy than a less intensive surveillance protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This calls into question the concept that extensive sampling with the Seattle protocol consistently detects early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
