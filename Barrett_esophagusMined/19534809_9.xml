<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The progression from Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is associated with the acquirement of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-resistant phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23614">deoxycholate</z:chebi> (DCA) has been proposed to play an important role in the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, but the precise molecular mechanisms remain undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate DCA-stimulated COX-2 signaling pathways and their possible contribution to deregulated cell survival and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Following exposure of SKGT-4 cells to DCA, protein levels of COX-2, MAPK and PARP were examined by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AP-1 activity was assessed by mobility shift assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DCA-induced toxicity was assessed by DNA fragmentation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DCA induced persistent activation of the AP-1 transcription factor with Fra-1 and JunB identified as the predominant components of the DCA-induced AP-1 complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DCA activated Fra-1 via the Erk1/2- and p38 MAPK while Erk1/2 is upstream of JunB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, DCA stimulation mediated inhibition of proliferation with concomitant low levels of caspase-3-dependent PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Induction of the anti-apoptotic protein COX-2 by DCA, via MAPK/AP-1 pathway appeared to balance the DCA mediated activation of pro-apoptotic markers such as PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both of these markers were increased upon COX-2 suppression by aspirin pretreatment prior to DCA exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DCA regulates both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and COX-2-regulated cell survival in esophageal cells suggesting that the balance between these two opposing signals may determine the transformation potential of DCA as a component of the refluxate </plain></SENT>
