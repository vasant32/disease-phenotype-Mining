<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data obtained from 1068 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 37.9% of the patients, the histological diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was an incidental finding, whereas 32.7% of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were diagnosed only at histology but not during endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 92.4% were diagnosed only by the pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our analysis shows that an endoscopic diagnosis suspicious for Barrett's mucosa is made in 62.1% of the cases, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 70%, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in only 7.6% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, because <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is detected for the most part at the invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> state, but not in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> stage, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, needs to be improved by additional biopsies for histopathological investigation </plain></SENT>
