<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Duplication of the muscularis mucosae (MM) has been described in BE esophagectomy specimens, where it can pose difficulties with accurate staging of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency, morphologic characteristics, and effect of MM duplication in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> staging in EMRs have not yet been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 122 EMR specimens from 100 patients from 1999 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following histologic features were scored: depth of EMR, presence of MM duplication and its extent, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> changes (extension of smooth muscle into lamina propria), gland entrapment, and diagnosis (original and study/final) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinomas</z:mp> reaching the level of submucosa were classified as invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (INV); those confined to lamina propria or MM were classified as intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (IMAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 122 EMRs, 11 (9%) reached mucosa only, 109 (89%) extended to submucosa, and 2 (2%) extended into muscularis propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MM duplication was present in 67% (75 of 111 specimens that reached at least submucosa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>Prolapse</z:mpath> changes were noted in 65 (54%) cases and gland entrapment in 67 (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Final <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathologic diagnoses</z:e> were 9 (7%) no specialized Barrett mucosa, 4 (3%) BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 13 (11%) low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 51 (42%) high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 33 (27%) IMAC, and 12 (10%) INV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EMRs without BE were less likely to show MM duplication (P = 0.01) and there was a trend toward less frequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> change (P = 0.08) and less gland entrapment (P = 0.08) as compared with EMRs with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences with respect to MM duplication, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> change, or gland entrapment between BE with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, IMAC, or INV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among 33 cases of IMAC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invaded lamina propria in 10 (30%), inner or single MM in 14 (42%), space between duplicated MM in 5 (15%), and outer MM layer in 4(12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lymphatic invasion was seen in 2 (10%) cases in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> reached the space between MM layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overstaging of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> occurred in the original reports in 8 (7%) cases due to misinterpretation of the muscular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, including one case in which the deep MM was interpreted as muscularis propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results show that MM duplication is commonly seen in EMR specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is closely associated with the presence of BE but is not affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1258085" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barrett epithelium</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Pathologists need to be aware of this distinctive <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of BE for accurate staging of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, particularly to avoid mistaking a thickened outer MM as muscularis propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Level of IMAC may be a critical feature because of potential access to lymphatic spaces between duplicated MM layers, and we therefore recommend including an explicit statement about the depth of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> invasion rather than using only broad terms such as IMAC or INV in the diagnostic report </plain></SENT>
