<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with or without prior endoscopic resection safely and effectively removes early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We speculated that this approach might also be suited for early squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess our initial experiences with RFA for high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) and esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137,C0751688" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous cell cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) limited to the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective case series study in two tertiary centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with at least one unstained lesion (USL) of the esophagus using Lugol's chromoendoscopy and squamous HGIN/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> upon biopsy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the case of nonflat USLs, endoscopic resection was performed for staging and to render the mucosa flat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After endoscopic resection and subsequent circumferential RFA, chromoendoscopy was repeated every 3 months with focal RFA of residual USLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up chromoendoscopy was repeated at 6 months and annually thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was complete histological response for any squamous intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 13 patients (10 HGIN, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following endoscopic resection in nine patients, the median extent of USLs was 4 cm and 50 % of circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 13 patients achieved a complete response after a median of 2 RFA sessions (IQR 1 - 3 sessions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RFA-related complications included two mucosal lacerations (at the endoscopic resection scar) and one intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, none requiring therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic resection-/RFA-related complications were three stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Dilation resulted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in one patient (managed with a covered stent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no recurrences (median follow-up 17 months [IQR 11 - 22 months]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that RFA with or without prior endoscopic resection for esophageal squamous HGIN and mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> is feasible and effective </plain></SENT>
