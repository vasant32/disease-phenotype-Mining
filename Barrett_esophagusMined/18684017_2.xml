<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical, endoscopic, and histological features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) diagnosed at our institution between 2000 and 2007 following the criteria of the British Society of Gastroenterology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This society defines BE as a segment of columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (CLO) (whether intestinalized or not) of any length, visible endoscopically above the gastroesophageal junction and confirmed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was challenged after immunostaining for Cdx2 (marker of intestinal differentiation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information was collected with respect to age, symptoms, treatment, and endoscopic and histological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve children (10 males and 2 females) with a median age of 11.7 (2 to 17) years had been diagnosed with CLO-BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histology confirmed BE in 31 of 38 endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial diagnosis was reviewed according to Cdx2 results in 10 of 12 patients: Cdx2 strongly expressed in 4 cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (the diagnosis of BE was maintained); was negative in 4 other patients with "CLO" mucosa (reviewed diagnosis was that of expansion of the gastric cardia into the distal esophagus); and 2 patients had occasional Cdx2-positive cells showing cardia-type mucosa with goblet cells (early BE?) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The estimated prevalence of CLO-BE in the pediatric population of South Yorkshire (United Kingdom) is 0.0024%, 0.8% in children referred for endoscopy and 5.5% in the children with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the BE and confirmation of intestinal differentiation may have prognostic implications that can impact the surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that intestinal differentiation as demonstrated with Cdx2 was only seen if goblet cells were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A consensus definition and further studies to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of BE at this age are needed </plain></SENT>
