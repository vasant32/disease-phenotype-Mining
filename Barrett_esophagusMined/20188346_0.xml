<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The management of high-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0000467'>esophageal dysplasia</z:mp> has included surveillance, endoscopic ablative techniques, and esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein we describe an alternative treatment, laparoscopic transgastric esophageal mucosal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Laparoscopic transgastric esophageal mucosal resection was accomplished through an anterior gastrotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mucosa was stripped from the Z-line to the proximal extent of the abnormal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gastrotomy then was closed with a linear stapler, and a Nissen fundoplication was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the distal esophagus underwent mucosal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 4 to 7 years of endoscopic surveillance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients have regenerated squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient developed nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> after 2 years and was treated medically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two strictures were treated successfully with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic transgastric esophageal mucosal resection was a reasonable treatment for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in this small sample of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This technique is a potential alternative treatment for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
