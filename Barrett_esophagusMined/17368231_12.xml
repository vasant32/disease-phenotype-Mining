<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Potential advantages for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) screening include ability to return to work as a result of lack of intravenous sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We designed a Markov model to compare lifetime costs and life expectancy for a cohort of 50-year old men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> for the presence of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the base-case strategy of no screening for BE to 2 competing screening strategies: (1) ECE followed by upper endoscopy (EGD) if BE were suspected or if there was poor visualization on the ECE; and (2) standard sedated EGD with biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cost estimates were obtained from a third-party payer perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each strategy we determined lifetime costs, life-years gained, numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> detected, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, and procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial EGD was more expensive but more effective compared with the no screening strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assuming a theoretical cohort of 10,000 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, initial EGD cost $1988 and was associated with 18.54 life-years compared with $2392 and 18.36 life-years for the ECE arm and $901 and 18.30 life-years for the no screening arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of screening with EGD compared with the no screening arm was $4530 per life-year gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The model was robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Initial EGD appears more effective and less costly compared with ECE under base-case conditions for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> undergoing screening for BE </plain></SENT>
