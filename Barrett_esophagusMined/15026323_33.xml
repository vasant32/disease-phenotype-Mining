<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the role played by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">polypeptide hormone</z:chebi> gastrin, specifically its antiapoptotic effects through activation of protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In esophageal cell lines with low basal levels of activated PKB/Akt, phosphorylation could be induced by exogenous amidated gastrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High basal levels of activated PKB/Akt were linked to endogenous gastrin expression and were reduced by treatment with a cholecystokinin-type 2 receptor (CCK-2R) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of a constitutively active splice variant of the CCK-2R additionally increased basal activation of PKB/Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that gastrin acting in an autocrine and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> manner via a CCK-2R isoform may activate PKB/Akt and that with expression of gastrin and CCK-2R isoforms increasing in BM samples, gastrin may aid progression of BM through amplification of antiapoptotic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence for this proposal was provided through the observed specific up-regulation of PKB/Akt in BM samples </plain></SENT>
