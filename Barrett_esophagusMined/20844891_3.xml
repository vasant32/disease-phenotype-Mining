<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry might help to differentiate between these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of CDX2, LI-cadherin, mucin 2 (MUC2), blood group 8 (BG8, Lewis(y)), claudin-2, and villin was investigated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastroesophageal (n = 23) and in Barrett's (n = 17) mucosa, in low-grade (n = 12) and high-grade (n = 9) intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (IEN) as well as in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n =���16), using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For CDX2 and LI-cadherin, the immunoreactivity score was highest in IEN while for MUC2, BG8, and villin, it dropped gradually from Barrett's via IEN to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and expression of Claudin-2 was only weak and focal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of MUC2 and LI-cadherin differed significantly between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined lesions except between low-grade and high-grade IEN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MUC2 and LI-cadherin are useful immunohistochemical markers for the differentiation between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glandular mucosa, Barrett's mucosa, IEN, and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus; however, none of the examined markers was helpful for the differentiation between low-grade and high-grade IEN </plain></SENT>
