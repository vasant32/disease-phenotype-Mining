<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heat-shock protein 27 (Hsp27), a small heat-shock protein which is protective against cytotoxic stresses, was abundant in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, Hsp27 expression was markedly lower in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hsp27 protein was most highly expressed in the upper layers of squamous epithelium and exhibited a pattern of expression that corresponded with the degree of squamous maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern and Southern analysis demonstrated Hsp27 to be regulated at the level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcription or abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> oesophageal tissues were examined for gender differences in Hsp27 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women expressed fourfold higher levels of Hsp27 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, however, this difference was not appreciable in protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hsp27 protein was inducible by heat shock in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines and an immortalized oesophageal epithelial cell line (HET-1A), but not by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate abundant constitutive expression of the stress-response protein Hsp27 in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophagus, and suggest that low-level expression in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> may be one factor which may influence susceptibility to oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
