<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Published results, however, show marked variation in its efficacy, and optimum treatment parameters have not been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated how the dose of ALA and the colour of the illuminating light influenced the biological effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients were enrolled into a randomised controlled trial of red versus green (635 nm or 512 nm) laser light activation for the eradication of HGD with ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A further 21 patients were subsequently treated with the most effective regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regular endoscopic follow-up with quadrantic biopsies every 2 cm was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was eradication of HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient's receiving ALA at 30 mg/kg relapsed to HGD more than those receiving 60 mg/kg (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, for those treated with ALA 60 mg/kg, red laser light was more effective than green laser light (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis of the 21 patients who were subsequently treated with this optimal regimen demonstrated an eradication rate of 89% for HGD and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free proportion of 96% at 36 months' follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using an ALA dose of 60 mg/kg activated by 1,000 J/cm red laser light, we found that ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was a highly effective treatment for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
