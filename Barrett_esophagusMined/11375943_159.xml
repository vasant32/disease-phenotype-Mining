<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 20-year period, patients were diagnosed and observed through an organized surveillance program at the Hines Veterans Affairs Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The program was supported by Hines VA and organized and managed by 2 endoscopists using preestablished endoscopic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 1099 patients, and 36,251 esophageal mucosal specimens were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine of 1099 patients (7.2%) initially had HGD (34 prevalent) or subsequently developed HGD (45 incident) without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 75 HGD patients who remained without detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> after the 1 year of intensive searching, 12 developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (16%) during a mean 7.3-year surveillance period: 11 of the 12 who were compliant were considered cured with surgical or ablation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> did not develop in the remaining 63 HGD patients during the surveillance period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HGD without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> follows a relatively benign course in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the patients who eventually progress to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> during regular surveillance, surgical resection is curative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surveillance endoscopies with biopsy is a valid and safe follow-up strategy for Barrett's patients who have HGD without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
