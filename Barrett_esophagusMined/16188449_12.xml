<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The goal of surveillance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is to detect high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The natural history of HGD is unclear, but because of the reported high risk of coexistent invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, oesophagectomy is currently the gold standard treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent reports suggest the risk of coexistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> may be lower and that the optimum treatment for HGD is continuing surveillance or mucosal ablation treatment, reserving oesophagectomy for those patients with invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To re-examine the role of oesophagectomy we looked at the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> in patients undergoing resection for HGD and their subsequent outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective analysis of 240 patients undergoing oesophagectomy over 6 years under a single surgeon in a single centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis was focused on patients undergoing oesophagectomy for HGD picked up during Barrett's surveillance endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e>, morbidity, mortality and survival of this subgroup is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperatively, 17 patients were diagnosed with HGD and underwent oesophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 17 (65%) patients had coexistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> and six patients had HGD alone in the resected specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no in-patient mortality, four patients had significant respiratory complications and three patients had radiological/clinical anastomotic leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 patients with HGD only are alive to date (3-68 months) and 3 of 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> have died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We continue to advocate oesophagectomy for HGD as the optimum treatment in the light of the high rate of coexistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Oesophagectomy for HGD can be performed with low morbidity and minimal mortality in a specialist centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the lower rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> found in HGD reported by other groups result from interobserver variation in grading of HGD, variability in histological sampling of the resected oesophagus and variability in the endoscopic technique of acquisition of biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
