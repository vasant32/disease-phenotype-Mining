<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There has been a dramatic increase in recent years in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and the esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> associated with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adequate monitoring strategies and improved diagnostic procedures are therefore essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alongside conventional video endoscopy with four-quadrant biopsies, many additional diagnostic procedures are now available to improve monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These allow early diagnosis of dysplastic areas and early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic therapy has gained more and more importance in the treatment of early esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> over the last few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Localized lesions in the Barrett's segment should be treated by endoscopic resection (ER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only in patients with not localized or multifocal superficial lesions photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) should be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between the different ER techniques the "suck and cut"-technique with ligation device or cap should be favoured to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> strip biopsy in the esophagus because of the size of the resected specimen and its technical feasibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ER of high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> should be considered as the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ER of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a safe and effective method but should only be performed by experienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
