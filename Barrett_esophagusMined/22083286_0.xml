<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epithelial cells and myofibroblasts are well-characterized histomorphological elements of tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are distinguished from one another on the basis of topography and of differences in cytokeratin (CK) and α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Certain epithelial cells exhibit CK / SMA co-expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to define the immunophenotypical characteristics of these biphenotypic cells with respect to cytodifferentiation (broad spectrum of CKs, SMA), cell-cell interaction (E-cadherin, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> - APC, β-catenin), and cell survival (cyclooxygenase-2 - Cox-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the routine gastrointestinal pathology service of the Department of Pathology, University of Szeged, tissue samples were identified from instances of cervical inlet patch (n = 5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n=5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (n=5), fundic gland <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> (n=2), gastric neoplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> (n=1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (n=5), and colonic neoplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> (n=3). that contained epithelial cells expressing SMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These biphenotypic cells were further immunophenotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Foregut-derived biphenotypic cells expressed CKs 7 and 20, while hindgut-derived biphenotypic cells expressed only CK 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subepithelial myofibroblasts adjacent to biphenotypic epithelium expressed Cox-2, SMA, and β-catenin, as did biphenotypic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myofibroblasts, however, did not express CKs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In neoplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, APC expression weakened as cytologic atypism increased, while intermingled biphenotypic cells in neoplastic glands overexpressed APC, as did myofibroblasts beneath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CK subspecies expression in biphenotypic cells reflects embryonic development of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotyping analysis addresses bidirectional (via <z:mpath ids='MPATH_85'>transdifferentiation</z:mpath> from epithelia into myofibroblasts or vice versa) formation of biphenotypic cells within damaged epithelium, a phenomenon that must be further analysed </plain></SENT>
