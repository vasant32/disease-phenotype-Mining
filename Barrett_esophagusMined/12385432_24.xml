<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> histology at the gastroesophageal junction, and in particular the nature of cardiac mucosa, remains in dispute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the relationship of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the gastroesophageal junction (CIM) to Barrett's and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the stomach (GIM) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the immunostaining characteristics of cardiac mucosa and CIM and compare their staining pattern with that of other foregut mucosal types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the immunostaining patterns of these foregut tissues would provide insight into the nature and etiology of cardiac mucosa and CIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens from 50 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antral or fundic mucosa, cardiac mucosa, squamous mucosa, CIM, GIM, or Barrett's were obtained and immunostained with a panel of monoclonal antibodies including those for cytokeratins 7 and 20 (CK7/CK20) and DAS-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biopsies from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric antral and fundic mucosa and squamous esophageal mucosa <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed a non-Barrett's type CK7/CK20 immunostaining pattern, whereas in 85% of patients, cardiac mucosa had a Barrett's type CK7/CK20 pattern (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Barrett's type CK7/ CK20 staining pattern was seen in 100% of Barrett's, 78% of CIM, and 0% of GIM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, DAS-1 staining was similar in patients with CIM and Barrett's and significantly different in patients with GIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cytokeratin immunostaining of cardiac mucosa demonstrates significant differences from recognized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric and esophageal mucosa but a similarity to Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that cardiac mucosa, like Barrett's, may be acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Likewise, immunostaining similarities between CIM and Barrett's biopsies point to the possibility of a reflux etiology for CIM in some patients </plain></SENT>
