<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recent increase in the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> being diagnosed is probably directly related to a proportional increase in endoscopic biopsies of the esophagus and awareness of premalignant potential of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the endoscopist can detect Barrett's mucosa with fair degree of accuracy, the radiologic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> still remains a diagnostic challenge despite several well established radiologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 65 patients with pathologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and found a wide spectrum of radiologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These include <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> in 49, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in 38, strictures in 32, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 20, and characteristic Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition ascending or migrating strictures were found in 10, mucosal pattern simulating areae gastricae in 5, cricopharyngeal dysfunction in 4, and fixed spiral folds in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This constellation of radiologic features, some of which have not been previously emphasized, should further assist radiologists in suggesting the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
