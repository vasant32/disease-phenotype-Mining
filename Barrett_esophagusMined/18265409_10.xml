<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abnormal DNA ploidy status has been suggested as a prognostic factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> progression into esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to compare image cytometry DNA analysis (ICDA) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in the assessment of DNA ploidy status in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), and to determine the value of these abnormalities as an adjunct to conventional cytology in detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brush cytology specimens of 90 BE patients were examined using ICDA and FISH with peri-centromeric probes for chromosomes 7 and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of ICDA and FISH were compared with each other, and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> grade or EAC as determined by histology and cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH and ICDA detected abnormalities in 41% (37/90) and 22% (19/90) of the BE cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gains of chromosome 7 and/or 17 were present in 13% of nondysplasia cases, which further increased with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> stage, while overall DNA content <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was detected predominantly in high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using FISH results combined with cytology, we were able to identify IND/LGD (indefinite/ low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) with a sensitivity and specificity of 75 and 76%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH alone detected HGD/EAC with a high sensitivity and specificity of 85 and 84%, which was superior to that of cytology alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, FISH is more sensitive than ICDA to detect chromosomal abnormalities in BE brush cytology specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FISH detects chromosomal gains in early stages of BE and represents a valuable adjunct to conventional cytology to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or EAC </plain></SENT>
