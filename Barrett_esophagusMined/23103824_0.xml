<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and safety of RFA for patients with BE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> are characterized incompletely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 244 patients treated with RFA for BE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy outcomes were complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CEIM), complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, total treatments, and RFA sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety outcomes included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, stricture, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified factors associated with incomplete EIM and stricture formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CEIM was achieved in 80% of patients, and complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was achieved in 87%; disease progressed in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A higher percentage of patients with incomplete EIM were female (40%) than those with CEIM (20%; P = .045); patients with incomplete EIM also had a longer segment of BE (5.5 vs 4.0 cm; P = .03), had incomplete healing between treatment sessions (45% vs 15%; P = 0.004), and underwent more treatment sessions (4 vs 3; P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incomplete healing was associated independently with incomplete EIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients (9.4%) had a treatment-related complication during 777 treatment sessions (3.0%), including strictures (8.2%), postprocedural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> (1.6%), and hospitalizations (1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed strictures were more likely to use <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> than those without strictures (70% vs 45%; P = .04), have undergone antireflux surgery (15% vs 3%; P = .04), or had erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (35% vs 12%; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RFA is highly effective and safe for treatment of BE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Strictures were the most common complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Incomplete healing between treatment sessions was associated with incomplete EIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> use, prior antireflux surgery, and a history of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> predicted stricture formation </plain></SENT>
