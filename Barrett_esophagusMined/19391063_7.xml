<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is typically done through morphologic analysis of esophageal tissue biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such samples contain several cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laser capture microdissection (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>) allows the isolation of specific cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of overlap of the two sample types and to define a set of genes that might serve as biochemical markers for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Biopsies were obtained from regions of the glandular tissue of BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus from 9 subjects with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples from 5 subjects were examined as whole tissue (BE [whole]; E [whole]), and in 4 subjects the glandular epithelium of BE was isolated using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> (BE [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>]) and compared with the averaged values (E [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>]) for both basal cell (B [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>]) and squamous cell (S [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>]) epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gene expression revealed 1797 probe sets between BE [whole] and E [whole] (fold change &gt; 2.0; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of these genes (74%) were also differentially expressed between BE [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>] and E [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>], showing that there was high concordance between the two sampling methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> provided a great deal of additional information (2113 genes) about the alterations in gene expression that may represent the BE phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are differences in gene expression profiles depending on whether specimens are whole tissue biopsies or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> dissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whole tissue biopsies should prove satisfactory for diagnostic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because the data from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> samples delineated many more Barrett's-specific genes, this procedure might provide more information regarding pathogenesis than would whole tissue material </plain></SENT>
