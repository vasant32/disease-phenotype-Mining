<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty esophagectomies (32 specimens with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and 18 with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) were reviewed for the presence of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The whole resected specimens were cut, and a total of 1677 blocks (measuring up to 4.0 x 0.5 cm) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In resections with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, a mean of 33.6 sections (range, 16 to 55 sections) were excised, and in those with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, a mean of 33.4 sections (range, ten to 60 sections) were cut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Barrett's mucosa (without or with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 18 specimens with an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (100%) and in 13 of the 32 specimens (40.6%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In ten of the 13 specimens with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, adjacent areas with high-grade squamous cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and/or the adjacent squamous cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were found separated from the Barrett's mucosa by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium, supporting the view that these two lesions are not related to one another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early clinical and experimental data showed that squamous cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> antedated the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> in that organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One possible suggestive of these findings is that the detection of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (without or with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) should prompt the endoscopist also to examine carefully the rest of the esophagus to exclude mucosal alterations possibly connected with squamous cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in that organ </plain></SENT>
