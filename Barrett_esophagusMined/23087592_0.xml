<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optical spectroscopic techniques have shown promising results in the diagnosis of disease on a cellular scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They do not require tissue removal, can be performed in vivo, and allow for real time diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy are most effective in revealing molecular properties of tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Light scattering spectroscopy (LSS) relates the spectroscopic properties of light elastically scattered by small particles, such as epithelial cell nuclei and organelles, to their size, shape and refractive index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is capable of characterizing the structural properties of tissue on cellular and sub-cellular scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in order to be useful in the detection of early cancerous changes which are otherwise not visible to the naked eye, it must rapidly survey a comparatively large area while simultaneously detecting these cellular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both goals are achieved by combining LSS with spatial scanning imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two examples are described in this article </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The first reviews a clinical system for screening patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The second presents a novel advancement in confocal light absorption and scattering spectroscopic (CLASS) microscopy </plain></SENT>
