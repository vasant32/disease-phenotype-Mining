<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The utility of endoscopy in the management of patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the impact of endoscopy on the subsequent management of patients with uncomplicated reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 742 patients underwent endoscopy for symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopists recorded the therapy before endoscopy, the findings of endoscopy, and the treatment recommendations after endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in pre-endoscopy therapy or grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in subjects undergoing endoscopy for failed therapy versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After endoscopy, the most common strategy for patients taking <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> was to maintain or increase the dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For those taking an H2 blocker before endoscopy, the most common outcome was to switch the patient to <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi>, independent of the grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients undergoing endoscopy for symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were switched to <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> regardless of the endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> was identified and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It appears that endoscopy itself did not change the management of patients receiving H2-blocker therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A trial of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> before endoscopy should be considered </plain></SENT>
