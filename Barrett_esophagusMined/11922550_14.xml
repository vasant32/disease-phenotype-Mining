<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There are no endoscopic features that distinguish <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the cardia (CIM) from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens are therefore randomly obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing mucosa with significant potential sampling errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enhanced magnification endoscopy involves the combined use of magnification endoscopy with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> instillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the value of enhanced magnification endoscopy in detecting CIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing elective upper endoscopy were invited to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were included if the squamocolumnar junction and the esophagogastric junction were judged to be at the same level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhanced magnification endoscopy was performed with 3% <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> instillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Standard endoscopy was followed by magnification endoscopy and repeated after <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> spraying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surface patterns were characterized before and after <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> spraying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observed surface patterns were compared with histological results obtained from a single targeted biopsy specimen of each pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of CIM was 34.8% (86/247 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After excluding 52 patients because of endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 195 patients were eligible for participation in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the study group, CIM was detected in 86 patients (44.1%) in targeted biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Enhanced magnification endoscopy detected four different patterns of the mucosal surface: I) round pits, II) reticular, III) villous, and IV) ridged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The yields of detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> according to endoscopic patterns were I) 0%, II) 5.3% (odds ratio = 0.05), III) 57.7% (odds ratio = 7.5, p = 0.0001), and IV) 95.8% (odds ratio = 42.8, p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CIM is more common than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Enhanced magnification endoscopy identifies two characteristic endoscopic patterns, villous (pattern III) and ridged (pattern IV), with outstanding clarity and resolution that correlate with histological identification of CIM with a single targeted biopsy sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Enhanced magnification endoscopy will permit longitudinal studies of an entity that can be identified endoscopically </plain></SENT>
