<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acid secretion, both basally and in response to gastrin 17-I, was significantly greater in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals without reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basal gastrin levels and meal-stimulated levels of the hormone were similar among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to gastrin, expressed as the concentration causing half-maximal acid secretion, was also similar among the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is speculated that elevated basal acid production in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disorder </plain></SENT>
