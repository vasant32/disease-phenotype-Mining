<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent studies have reported high prevalence rates of short segments of specialized columnar epithelium (SCE) in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of SCE with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> is not well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence and associations of short segments of SCE in the distal esophagus amongst Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 271 patients (mean age 36 [14] y; 160 men) undergoing diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were interviewed regarding symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, and history of medications, smoking or chewing tobacco and alcohol ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At endoscopy, presence and grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One biopsy each was taken from the squamocolumnar junction and 2 cm proximal to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>/eosin and alcian blue/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathologist was blinded to the clinical and endoscopic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Short segments of SCE in the distal esophagus were present in 16/271 (6%; CI 5.03-6.97) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing age (p&lt;0.01), and endoscopic (p&lt;0.01) and histologic (p&lt;0.001) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were associated with its presence, whereas symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, smoking, tobacco chewing, use of alcohol or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient with SCE had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prevalence of short segments of SCE in the distal esophagus amongst Indians is low and is usually associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
