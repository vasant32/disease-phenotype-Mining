<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SSc is associated with an increased risk of BE related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine the outcomes of BE and estimate the EAC risk in SSc patients over a 3-year prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SSc patients were recruited through EUSTAR network centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criterion was a recent histological finding of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were then prospectively followed and, as recommended, a second oesophageal endoscopy was performed according to the presence of BE-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 50 SSc patients with BE (40 without and 10 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) were included and 46 completed the follow-up (138 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the 3-year follow-up, 4 of the 46 BE patients (3% per year) were diagnosed with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/EAC, of which one developed cardial EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EAC incidence in the BE subgroup with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> increased to 4% per year compared with the absence of EAC cases in the BE subgroup without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results, in accordance with previous published data suggesting an increased risk of EAC or cardial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in SSc, highlight the need for accurate follow-up of BE SSc patients at risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
