<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This contention is supported mostly by studies that involve only a small subset of patients (ie, those clinically thought to have an upper gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only a few investigations have examined the role of these paired specimens in the general patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred twenty-two consecutive esophageal biopsies and brushings obtained during the same endoscopic session were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same or a similar diagnosis was made for both specimen types in 166 (74.8%) of the specimen pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these pairs with diagnostic agreement, the most frequent diagnosis included Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (46), Candida <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (37), and morphologically nonspecific <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> and six <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were also detected in this subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic differences existed among 56 (25.2%) of the pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common diagnosis in this subset was Candida <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This fungus was present in 27 brushings, but not in the concurrently obtained biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> and one <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were diagnosed by cytology but not by biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> was found only in the biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the esophagus, brushings and biopsies are truly complementary for the detection of both neoplastic and inflammatory conditions </plain></SENT>
