<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the potential clinical significance of this molecular genetic marker in the progression of Barrett's epithelium to invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, we studied 20 patients with Barrett's epithelium, 10 of whom had an associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>p53 gene mutations were screened using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and p53 oncoprotein distribution by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Point mutations were localized to exons 5 and 7 of the p53 gene, previously recognized as "hot spots." p53 gene mutations and immunoreactivity were detected in 7 of 10 patients with primary esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and in 6 patients with associated Barrett's epithelium, 3 of whom had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Little correlation was observed between p53 positivity and clinicopathologic findings or outcome, although two patients with p53 mutations subsequently developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second primary cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 10 patients with Barrett's epithelium alone, 6 had p53 mutations, with mild or no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> histologically, suggesting that p53 gene mutation may be an early event in progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient has developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> to date, with a median follow-up of 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies further implicate the p53 gene in the Barrett's epithelium-to-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prospective surveillance studies incorporating molecular analysis of the p53 gene are warranted to further evaluate p53 as a predictor of patients at high risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
