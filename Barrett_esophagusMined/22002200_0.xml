<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After improvements in antireflux surgery (ARS), a percentage of reherniations still has cause of failure attributed to a reopening of the hiatal closure or to an untreated short esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the existence of short esophagus and its treatment results still are matters of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The consecutive medical records containing prospective collective data for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) during the period 2001-2009 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Every patient considered to be a candidate for ARS was studied with a dynamic contrast radiologic study (DCRxS) in which the esophageal length was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The choice of surgical technique takes into account the motility status of the esophagus and its estimated length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the postoperative period, every patient had a DCRxS and an endoscopy 1 year after surgery and then after 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Satisfaction with the procedure was surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The consecutive medical records of 437 GERD patients showed that 171 underwent ARS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the preoperative DCRxS, a short esophagus was suspected in 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A short esophagus was confirmed for 11 patients (6.4% of the surgically treated patients), and a Collis procedure plus a funduplication was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the preoperative endoscopy, two patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the postoperative period, seven patients presented with a healthy mucosa, one BE had disappeared, and the remaining four BEs remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During an average follow-up period of 43 months, no reherniations occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 11 patients achieved good symptoms control and would choose surgery again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short esophagus can be suspected during preoperative studies, and in this series, it was confirmed in 6.4% of the patients who had surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A Collis fundoplication procedure seems to be an adequate operation to control reflux symptoms and to avoid reherniation over the long-term follow-up period </plain></SENT>
