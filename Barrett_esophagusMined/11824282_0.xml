<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only one study of the recently published, randomized controlled trials in potentially resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> has shown improvement in survival by preoperative chemotherapy compared to surgery alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there has been a consistent observation that in patients who respond to preoperative therapy survival was significantly prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a diagnostic test that allows prediction of response is considered to be crucial for the future use of preoperative chemotherapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular markers for response prediction and reliable non-invasive techniques such as FDG-PET are not yet established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the moment therefore responder should undergo esophagectomy for definitive curative treatment, whereas non-responder may undergo individualized salvage therapy </plain></SENT>
