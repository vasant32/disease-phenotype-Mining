<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: West Virginia Medicaid-paid claims data for the period January 1, 1995, to December 31, 1999, were used for the study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A prevalence-based approach was used to determine the cost of illness for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total cost of illness for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> more than tripled, from $182399 in 1995 to $623864 in 1999, with approximately a 4(1/2)-fold increase in medical and more than a threefold increase in pharmacy costs </plain></SENT>
