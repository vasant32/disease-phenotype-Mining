<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the frequency of changes of diagnosis by EMR compared with pre-EMR biopsy diagnosis for patients with and without visible lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this multicenter outcomes project, patients with Barrett's-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> undergoing EET at three tertiary-care centers were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing biopsies followed by EMR within six months were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were frequency of overall change of histopathologic diagnosis, change based on pre-EMR biopsy diagnosis, and change based on the presence of visible lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-eight BE patients (low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) 15 (10.9 %), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) 87 (63 %), esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) 36 (26.1 %)) were included; 114 (82.6 %) patients had visible lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EMR resulted in a change of diagnosis for 43 (31.1 %) patients (upgrade 14 (10.1 %); downgrade 29 (21 %)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For HGD patients, EMR downstaged <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> grade for 17 (19.5 %) cases and upstaged it to EAC for nine (10.3 %) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a change of diagnosis for 26 (29.9 %) HGD patients, irrespective of the presence or absence of visible lesions (p = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For EAC patients, EMR downstaged <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> grade in 10 (27.8 %) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a change of diagnosis for 10 (27.8 %) EAC patients, irrespective of the presence or absence of endoscopically visible lesions (p = 0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EMR results in a change of diagnosis for approximately 30 % of BE patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (with and without visible lesions) referred for EET </plain></SENT>
