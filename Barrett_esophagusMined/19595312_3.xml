<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The major risk factors for the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> remain long-standing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and resultant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Finding the exact method of adequate tissue sampling for surveillance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE remains a dilemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We prospectively compared standard large-capacity biopsy forceps with a new jumbo biopsy forceps for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING/DESIGN: Prospective, single-center investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/INTERVENTIONS: We prospectively enrolled 32 patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples were obtained in paired fashion alternating between the experimental (jumbo) and control (large-capacity) forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Each sample was assessed for histopathology, specimen size, and adequacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 712 specimens were available for analysis for this investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients were found to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and in 5 of those patients, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was only detected with the jumbo forceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean width was significantly greater in the Radial Jaw 4 jumbo group (3.3 mm vs 1.9 mm [P &lt; .005]) as was the mean depth (2.0 mm vs 1.1 mm [P &lt; .005]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen percent of samples obtained with the standard forceps provided an adequate sample, whereas the jumbo forceps provided an adequate sample 79% of the time (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: A lack of a validated index for assessment of tissue adequacy in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Radial Jaw 4 jumbo biopsy forceps significantly improves <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection and adequate tissue sampling in patients undergoing endoscopy for BE </plain></SENT>
