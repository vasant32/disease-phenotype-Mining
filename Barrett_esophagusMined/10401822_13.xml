<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Two hundred twenty-nine patients with symptoms suggestive of foregut disease underwent esophageal manometry, 24-hour pH monitoring, and upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy, with biopsy specimens obtained from the gastric antrum, the GEJ, and the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these and in an additional 114 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and the GEJ, the presence of H. pylori was determined by Giemsa stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, defined by abnormal esophageal acid exposure, and its manifestations (<z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp>, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> limited to the GEJ, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and GEJ) were correlated with the presence of H. pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Helicobacter pylori was found on the biopsy specimens of the gastric antrum in 14.0% (32/229) of the patients with benign disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was not related to the features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, including abnormal esophageal acid exposure, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of inflamed cardiac mucosa at the GEJ or <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp> was inversely related to H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and strongly associated with increased esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Helicobacter pylori was found in 22 (19.3%) of the 114 patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, which was not different from the prevalence of H. pylori in patients with benign disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Helicobacter pylori plays no role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> or its complications </plain></SENT>
