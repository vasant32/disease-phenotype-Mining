<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In Western countries endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) has been widely accepted for treatment of early Barrett;s <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and flat or depressed colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is infrequently performed for several reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It seems to be difficult to overcome the learning curve of this difficult technique because of the low case volume of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand ESD of esophageal or colorectal lesions is even more challenging and is considered to be inappropriate for learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition the indication for esophageal or colorectal ESD is controversial in view of excellent results of the well established EMR technique which is less time-consuming and safer than ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A recent survey of leading Western endoscopy centers indicated the limited experience with ESD with a low number of cases for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potential indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only a few training courses have been established and the number of ongoing clinical studies is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 12 out of 340 published articles on "endoscopic mucosal dissection" were reported from Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A better acceptance of ESD requires improvement of the technique to allow an easier, faster and safer approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is a strong demand for structured training courses and limitations of human cases to selected centers which participate in prospective trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A close collaboration between Western and Asian centers is recommended for improvement of the ESD technique and its clinical application </plain></SENT>
