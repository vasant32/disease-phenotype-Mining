<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Available data on the prevalence of esophageal and upper gut findings in patients with noncardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (NCCP) are scarce and limited to one center's experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the prevalence of esophageal and upper gut mucosal findings in patients undergoing upper endoscopy for NCCP only versus those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) symptoms only, using the national Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative (CORI) database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the study period, the CORI database received endoscopic reports from a network of 76 community, university, and Veteran Administration Health Care System (VAHCS)/military practice sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adult patients who underwent an upper endoscopy for NCCP only or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-related symptoms only were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics and prevalence of endoscopic findings were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 3,688 consecutive patients undergoing an upper endoscopy for NCCP and 32,981 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> upper endoscopy was noted in 44.1% of NCCP patients versus 38.8% of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the NCCP group, 28.6% had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (HH), 19.4% erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EE), 4.4% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), and 3.6% stricture/stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, HH, EE, and BE were significantly more common in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> group as compared with the NCCP group (44.8%, 27.8%, and 9.1%, respectively, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis of patients with NCCP, male gender was a risk factor for BE (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.35-2.55, P=0.0001) and being nonwhite was protective (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.86, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this group, male gender was also a risk factor for EE (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.54, P=0.001) and age&gt;or=65 yr was protective (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.6-0.89, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The NCCP group had a significantly higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> in the upper gastrointestinal tract as compared with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> group (2.0% vs 1.5%, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this endoscopic prevalence study, most of the endoscopic findings in NCCP were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> related, but less common as compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
