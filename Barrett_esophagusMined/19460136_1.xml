<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thymidylate synthase (TS) is known to have a unique 28 bp tandemly repeated sequence in the promoter region, and the majorities of subjects have a heterozygous double repeat/triple repeat genotype in their non-cancerous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the TS locus is known to occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, but there is no evidence that it is present in precancerous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency and timing of LOH at the TS locus in Barrett-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BA) and its precursory lesions, such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-three samples (including 37 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), 29 with IM, 13 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 44 with BA) were obtained from 100 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were obtained from the lower esophageal mucosa/IM/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/BA, when available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> squamous tissue from the upper esophagus was taken as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> tissues were analyzed for the TS genotype and TS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression using the real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method after laser-capture microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the patients with informative heterozygous genotype in their control samples, no sample with LOH at the TS locus was observed in the lower esophageal mucosa in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients (0/22 samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 6 out of 21 samples (28.6%) had LOH in IM, 2 of 7 (28.6%) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 10 of 25 (40.0%) in BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in TS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels was observed between TS genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that LOH is a relatively frequent and early event in the IM-BA sequence </plain></SENT>
