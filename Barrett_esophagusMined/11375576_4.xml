<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of extensions of squamous epithelium into the proximal stomach in patients undergoing routine upper endoscopy has recently been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The factors that may favor development of squamous epithelium within the proximal stomach remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who agreed to undergo ablation of Barrett's epithelium by using multipolar electrocoagulation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with a high dose of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The columnar-appearing mucosa was systematically treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, thermal injury was inadvertently induced in the proximal stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On endoscopy performed 4 to 6 weeks after treatment, the presence of squamous epithelium extending into the proximal stomach was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of Lugol's stain assisted in confirming the squamous nature of the abnormal tissue, which was confirmed histologically by cytokeratin immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 12 patients included in the study had a mean length of Barrett's epithelium of 3.8 +/- 0.7 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi>, mean dose 66 +/- 6.0 mg, and had a mean percent total time that the pH was less than 4 of 1.9 +/- 0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean length and width of gastric squamous extensions were 1.7 +/- 0.2 cm and 0.8 +/- 0.1 cm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the squamous extensions into the stomach were documented before mucosal ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The extensions stained positively for cytokeratin 13 and negatively for cytokeratin 8, thereby confirming their squamous nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thermal injury to the proximal stomach in patients undergoing ablation of Barrett's epithelium and profound acid suppression results in repair by squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recognition of this lesion is essential because it may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> as to the location of the esophagogastric junction in subsequent endoscopic evaluations </plain></SENT>
