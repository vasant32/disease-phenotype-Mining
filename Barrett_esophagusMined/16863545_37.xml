<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic therapy for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is evolving rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate safety and efficacy of stepwise radical endoscopic resection (ER) of BE containing early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (i.e., high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) in BE &lt; or = 5 cm, without signs of submucosal infiltration or lymph node/distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent resection sessions (cap technique after submucosal lifting) with intervals of 6 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between January 2003 and December 2004, 39 consecutive patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy was discontinued in two patients due to unrelated comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete eradication of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 37 treated patients in a median number of three sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Barrett's mucosa was achieved in 33 (89%) patients: 4 patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had undergone APC [<z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation]) were found to have small isles of Barrett's mucosa underneath neosquamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in two out of 88 (2%) ER procedures: one asymptomatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, one delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic stenosis occurred in 10 of 39 (26%) patients and was effectively treated by endoscopic bougienage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 11 months, no patients died and none had recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stepwise radical ER is effective for selected patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in BE; provides optimal histopathological diagnosis; and may reduce recurrence rate, since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mucosa at risk is effectively removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Use of APC should be limited to prevent buried Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Methods for prevention of stenosis should be developed </plain></SENT>
