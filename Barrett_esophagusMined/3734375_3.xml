<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three aspects of the esophageal mucosal injury that occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> are discussed in this article </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, the histologic changes in the squamous epithelium-lined esophagus are variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some patients with reflux symptoms do not have histologic evidence of inflammatory cell infiltration within the mucosa, but rather may have more subtle effects of mucosal injury, namely, thickening of the basal regenerative layer, elongation of the papillae, or intraepithelial eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these more subtle findings often are merely confirmatory of other clinical indicators of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux</z:e>; they may have their most practical application to the research investigation of reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, the presence of esophageal mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may adversely affect lower esophageal sphincter function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon can be demonstrated in the cat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether it is operative in humans is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the development of columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (Barrett's epithelium) is more than a histologic curiosity because this condition confers an increased risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="?"><plain>Among several unanswered questions about Barrett's epithelium is what is an appropriate surveillance program for patients with Barrett's epithelium to detect the presence of, or predict the development of, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
