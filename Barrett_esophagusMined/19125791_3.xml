<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the incremental effect of 2-fluoro-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (FDG-PET) when used in addition to standard staging modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients referred to two surgeons in an Australian metropolitan teaching hospital with esophageal or esophago-gastric junction <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> between May 2002 and December 2006 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who had undergone prereferral treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing resection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100723'>gastrointestinal stromal tumors</z:hpo> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> within <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were also excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and non-clinical data were recorded prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment staging included routine CT scan and selective endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET was performed in patients judged to have curable disease on CT scanning and EUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From a total of 130 eligible patients, 76 were judged to have curable disease on the basis of CT and EUS findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these 76 patients, 19 (25%) were excluded from surgery due to additional information obtained from FDG-PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The addition of FDG-PET to routine preoperative staging resulted in the exclusion from surgery of 19 (25%) patients who prior to the introduction of FDG-PET would have undergone attempted resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET should be performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients under consideration for esophagogastric resection in order to avoid resection in patients with disseminated disease </plain></SENT>
