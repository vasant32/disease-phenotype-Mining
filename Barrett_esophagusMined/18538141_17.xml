<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Substantial proportions of patients do not respond to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> or progress to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> despite <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of biomarkers in predicting response to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine if biomarkers known to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in BE can predict loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients treated with ablative therapy for HGD/intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with BE and HGD/intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were studied prospectively from 2002 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers were assessed using fluorescence in situ hybridization performed on cytology specimens, for region-specific and centromeric probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> using cylindric diffusing fibers (wavelength, 630 nm; energy, 200 J/cm fiber) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multiple variable logistic regression was performed to determine predictors of response to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 126 consecutive patients (71 who underwent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and 55 patients who did not undergo <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and were under surveillance, to adjust for the natural history of HGD), were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty (40%) patients were responders (no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) at 3 months after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multiple variable analysis, P16 allelic loss (odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.96) predicted decreased response to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BE segment length (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59-0.85), and performance of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> (OR, 7.17; 95% CI, 2.50-20.53) were other independent predictors of loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: p16 loss detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization can help predict loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with BE and HGD/mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
