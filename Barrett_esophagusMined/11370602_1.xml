<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of dysplastic precursor lesions is impaired by problems of subjectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, DNA ploidy results of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were related to the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and to the progress of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 61 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, DNA ploidy was determined by image cytometry on imprints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsies (n = 145) were histologically examined for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> distinguishing between low- and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant correlation (p &lt; 0.001) between DNA ploidy and the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found, with 81% euploid DNA results in biopsies negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 86% abnormal DNA patterns in biopsies with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subgroup of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> DNA ploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that nearly 20% of biopsies classified <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-negative contained abnormal single cells or abnormal stemlines regarding DNA content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In several cases, suspect DNA results caused a modified reclassification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and there were cases in which patients negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> but positive for abnormal DNA ploidy developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> later on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, DNA ploidy by image cytometry is a suitable additive method for histological evaluation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It seems to be helpful in identifying patients at risk, perhaps before the development of clear <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
