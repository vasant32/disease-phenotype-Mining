<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only a minority of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> with 9p21 LOH have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> in the remaining p16 allele, and none have been found to have homozygous deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether p16 promoter hypermethylation may be an alternative mechanism for p16 inactivation in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, we examined the methylation status of the p16 promoter in flow-sorted aneuploid cell populations from 21 patients with premalignant Barrett's epithelium or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> modification, primer-extension preamplification, and methylation-specific PCR, we demonstrate that the methylation assay can be performed on 2 ng of DNA (approximately 275 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of 21 patients (38%) had p16 promoter hypermethylation and 9p21 LOH, including 3 patients who had only premalignant Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that promoter hypermethylation with LOH is a common mechanism for inactivation of p16 in the pathogenesis of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
