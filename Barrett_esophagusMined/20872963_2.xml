<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regular surveillance endoscopies can detect curable early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in asymptomatic patients, which in turn could improve the prognosis compared to symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early neoplastic lesions, which are amenable for local therapy, could be treated endoscopically, avoiding a major surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in the absence of obvious mucosal lesions, random four quadrant biopsies are done, which is associated with significant sampling error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Newer imaging modalities, such as autofluorescence endoscopy, are helpful in detecting subtle lesions that could be examined in detail with narrow band imaging to characterize and target biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This has the potential benefit of reducing the number of random biopsies with a better yield of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Confocal endomicroscopy provides "optical biopsies" and is a valuable tool in targeting biopsies to improve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection; however, this is technically challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fuji intelligent chromoendoscopy and I-Scan are recent additions to the imaging armamentarium that have produced notable early results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these additional new imaging techniques are promising, a thorough examination by high resolution white light endoscopy after clearing the mucosa with mucolytics should be the minimum standard to improve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection during Barrett's surveillance </plain></SENT>
