<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Few studies have compared the precision of various diagnostic tests used to determine the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the results of histological, endoscopic, and manometric tests for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in two closely spaced examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a Veterans Administration Cooperative Study, 192 patients with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> had esophageal manometry and endoscopy performed at baseline and after 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At each examination, the endoscopist localized the most proximal level of Barrett's epithelium and the lower esophageal sphincter and obtained esophageal biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred sixteen patients met the criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> on at least one of the two endoscopic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients with specialized columnar epithelium, 20% had specialized columnar epithelium found on only one of the two examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the mean lower esophageal sphincter level did not change, approximately 10% of patients had a change &gt; or = 4 cm on endoscopy and manometry between examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This led to an apparent change in the diagnosis in 18% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From one endoscopic examination to another, inconsistencies in the ability to detect specialized columnar epithelium are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may lead to substantial problems in establishing an accurate diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
