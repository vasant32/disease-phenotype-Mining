<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> contributes to the development of BE and its progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the roles of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and dysregulation of adipokines in these processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured fasting levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin in 392 patients enrolled in the Seattle <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated homeostatic model assessment scores (a measure of insulin sensitivity) and identified subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the association between these measures and the risk of EA using Cox regression models adjusted for known risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increasing homeostatic model assessment scores were associated with an increasing risk for EA; the strongest association was observed within the first 3 years after participants entered the study (hazard ratio [HR], 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-4.1; Ptrend = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Leptin level also was associated significantly with an increased risk of EA within 3 years (HR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.09-5.81; Ptrend = .03) and 6 years (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.01-4.26; Ptrend = .048) of baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of high-molecular-weight adiponectin had a nonlinear inverse association with risk of EA; the strongest associations were observed in the second tertile (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.14-0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic syndrome</z:e> was not associated with risk of EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with BE, increased levels of leptin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> are associated with increased risk for EA, whereas increased levels of high-molecular-weight adiponectin is associated inversely with EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These biomarkers might be used to determine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk among patients with BE </plain></SENT>
