<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the occurrence of microsatellite instability (MSI) in paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BE) with the aim of identifying a potential marker for patients at risk for developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at a later stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Endoscopic oesophageal biopsies from 6 pediatric patients harbouring BE and 6 age-matched controls were retrospectively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the samples were made anonymous, a 5-microm section was cut and stained with toluidine blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A precise cell was selected and captured using a laser microdissection microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite analysis was performed on the DNA extracted from the captured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers for 5 mononucleotide repeats and analysed by GeneMapper software on an ABI 3730 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA extracted from a formalin-fixed <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colonic adenocarcinoma</z:mp> known to have MSI was used as a positive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of the patients with BE was 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relevant complaint was long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> in 4 cases and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in 3 cases (1 case had both symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the cases had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e> with histological confirmation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reflux was associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> in each of 3 cases, and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histologically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases showed the presence of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> containing goblet cells replacing the squamous oesophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the cases tested showed any evidence of MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single molecular marker that would allow recognition of those patients at risk for Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has not yet been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The absence of MSI in our cases could be due to the need for a longer period of BE before genomic instability develops, or MSI may only arise in a proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This does not exclude other genetic alterations, however rare they may be </plain></SENT>
