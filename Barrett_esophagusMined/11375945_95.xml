<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine if a limited extent of HGD has the same potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> as diffuse HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed to assess the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in relationship to the extent of HGD found on endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of HGD was defined as focal if cytologic and/or architectural changes of HGD were limited to a single focus of 5 or fewer crypts and diffuse if more than 5 crypts were involved in a single biopsy specimen or if HGD involved more than one biopsy fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was assessed using a Cox proportional hazard model, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free survival was determined using survival curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with diffuse HGD and 33 with focal HGD satisfied selection criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>-free survival rates at 1 and 3 years were 93% and 86% for focal HGD compared with 62% and 44% for diffuse HGD (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, extent of HGD (relative risk, 5.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.84-15.56), nodularity on endoscopy (relative risk, 3.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.97-8.04), and lack of acid suppression (relative risk, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-5.28) were associated with an increased risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diffuse HGD had a 3.7-fold increase in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> compared with focal HGD (P = 0.02) on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with focal HGD are less likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> during the first year after diagnosis or on subsequent follow-up compared with diffuse HGD </plain></SENT>
