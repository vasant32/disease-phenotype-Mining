<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 5-year phase 3 trial was conducted to determine the extent of squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of BE with HGD after PHOPDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> was compared in patients with BE with HGD randomly assigned (2:1) to receive PHOPDT (n=138) or 20 mg <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> twice daily (n=70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent 4-quadrant jumbo esophageal biopsies every 2 cm throughout the pretreatment length of BE until 4 consecutive quarterly follow-up results were negative for HGD and then biannually up to 5 years or treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopies were reviewed by blinded gastroenterology pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histologic assessment of 33,658 biopsies showed no significant difference (P&gt; .05) in squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> between groups when compared per patient (30% vs 33%) or per biopsy (0.5% vs 1.3%), or when the average number of biopsies with squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> were compared per patient (0.48 vs 0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> per endoscopy was not found exclusively beneath squamous mucosa in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No difference was observed in squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> between patients given PHOPDT plus <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> compared with only <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> did not obscure the most advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of HGD with PHOPDT in patients with BE does not present a long-term risk of failure to detect subsquamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
