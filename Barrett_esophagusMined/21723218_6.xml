<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effects of consensus diagnosis of LGD on progression rates to HGD and EAC among expert pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a multicenter outcomes project, 210 patients with BE and LGD (classified as incident, prevalent, or persistent) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up for an average of 6.2 years (959.6 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persistent LGD was defined as detection of LGD on â‰¥2 consecutive occasions during the follow-up period and extent as either unifocal (LGD at one level of BE segment) or multifocal (&gt;1 level) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histology specimens were reviewed by 2 blinded pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients developed EAC (incidence of 0.44%/year), and 21 developed HGD (incidence of 1.6%/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of the combination of HGD and EAC was 1.83%/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no associations between presence of prevalent, incident, or persistent LGD and the extent of LGD with progression rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on consensus diagnosis of 88 reviewed specimens, there was no difference in the progression of LGD to either EAC (the incidence based on analyses by the local pathologist was 0.18%/year, the incidence when there was agreement between the local and one central pathologist was 0.21%/year, and the incidence when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 pathologists were in agreement was 0.39%/year) or combined HGD and EAC (0.94%/year, 0.87%/year, and 0.84%/year, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, patients with BE and LGD have a low annual incidence of EAC, similar to nondysplastic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There are no risk factors for progression and there is significant interobserver variation in diagnosis, even among expert pathologists </plain></SENT>
