<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical therapy of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> of the upper gastrointestinal tract is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, especially in elderly and co-morbid patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Japan endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) has been proven to be safe and efficacious in this indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 22 patients (68 +/- 14 years, 9 females) with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus (n = 5), early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus (T1N0M0, n = 11) or early <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (T1N0M0, n = 6) proven by high-resolution videoendoscopy (plus chromoendoscopy in most cases), miniprobe-endosonography (12-20 MHz) and biopsy were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesion size ranged from 7-40 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EMR was performed using a monofile snare, in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases after submucosal injection of an attenuated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>-solution (1:20,000) to effect a lifting sign. "En bloc" resection was possible in 17/22 cases (77 %), but in 5 patients piecemeal-resection had to be performed due to a larger lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Active <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred on 14 of 22 occasions (64 %), in another 5 patients secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (within 24 h after EMR) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these events could be managed endoscopically (mainly by hemoclip application) and blood transfusion was not required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other complications did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A complete resection (R0) was achieved in 21/22 cases, however, one patient had to undergo a second EMR procedure because histology of the first resected specimen had revealed malignant infiltration of the resection margin (R1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the second EMR procedure complete (R0)-resection was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to the histological findings after EMR the pre-procedural staging proved to be correct in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The control examinations (clinical exam, lab data, endoscopy with multiple biopsies, endosonography and CT) after EMR revealed no local or systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> in 21/22 patients (median follow-up 5 months, range 3-12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, in one patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett-esophagus</z:hpo> another mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was detected 3 months after EMR (located in opposite to the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> treated with EMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EMR seems to be a safe and effective (regarding local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control) therapy for high-grade dyplasia and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in the upper gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, long-term follow-up in these patients has to be awaited </plain></SENT>
