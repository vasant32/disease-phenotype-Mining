<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: A multipotential stem cell, possibly located in the submucosal gland ducts, has been suggested as the origin of metaplastic mucosa in the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The topographic distribution of these glands and their excretory ducts (SMG) within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e> (CLO) is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of SMG in relation to the type of overlying epithelium in patients with CLO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven oesophageal resection specimens were examined histologically in toto </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median frequency of SMG was similar in the metaplastic segments (0.12 SMG/mm) and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous segments (0.10 SMG/mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the metaplastic segments, the median frequency of SMG beneath the squamous islands was significantly higher than that observed under the columnar lined parts (0.22 versus 0.08 SMG/mm, P = 0.046), There was a strong accumulation of SMG at the squamo-columnar transition zones (0.53 SMG/mm), which was significantly greater than that found in the columnar and squamous parts (P = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The relative accumulation of SMG beneath squamous islands and the squamo-columnar junctions within the metaplastic segment supports the hypothesis that both metaplastic columnar mucosa and neosquamous epithelium originate from a progenitor in the SMG </plain></SENT>
