<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Green tea consumption has been shown to exhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-preventive activities in preclinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polyphenon E (Poly E) is a well-defined green tea-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine the effects of Poly E on the growth of human Barrett's and aerodigestive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells and the mechanisms involved in growth regulation by this agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells and immortalized Barrett's epithelial cells were used as model systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Poly E inhibited the proliferation of immortalized Barrett's cells as well as various <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells, and this was associated with the down-regulation of cyclin D1 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of cyclin D1 led to dephosphorylation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein in a dose-dependent manner; these changes were associated with G(1) cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poly E down-regulated cyclin D1 promoter activity and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, suggesting transcriptional repression, and this correlated with decreased nuclear beta-catenin and beta-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MG132, an inhibitor of 26S proteosome, blocked the Poly E-induced down-regulation of cyclin D1, and Poly E promoted cyclin D1 polyubiquitination, suggesting that Poly E also inhibits cyclin D1 expression by promoting its degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Poly E inhibits growth of transformed aerodigestive epithelial cells by suppressing cyclin D1 expression through both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results provide insight into the mechanisms by which Poly E inhibits growth of Barrett's and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells, and provides a rationale for using this agent as a potential chemopreventive and therapeutic strategy for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and its precursor, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
