<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on the quantitative characterization of nuclear structure alterations associated with preneoplastic progression in human esophageal epithelial cells using single-cell optical tomography and fully automated 3D karyometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We stained cultured cells with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and generated 3D images of individual cells by mathematically reconstructing 500 projection images acquired using optical absorption tomographic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For 3D karyometry, we developed novel, fully automated algorithms to robustly segment the cellular, nuclear, and subnuclear components in the acquired cell images, and computed 41 quantitative morphological descriptors from these segmented volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we developed algorithms to quantify the spatial distribution and texture of the nuclear DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We applied our methods to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, metaplastic, and dysplastic human esophageal epithelial cell lines, analyzing 100 cells per line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3D karyometric descriptors elucidated quantitative differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and enabled robust discrimination between cell lines on the basis of extracted morphological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The morphometric hallmarks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> such as increased nuclear size, elevated nuclear content, and anomalous chromatin texture and distribution correlated with this preneoplastic progression model, pointing to the clinical use of our method for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection </plain></SENT>
