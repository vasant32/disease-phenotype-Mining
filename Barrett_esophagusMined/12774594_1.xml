<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively audited surveillance practices in Scotland and prospectively assessed the impact of introducing local guidelines for Barrett s surveillance in Edinburgh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most respondents were gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority take random, not four quadrant, biopsies from the CLO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Edinburgh during 2000, 80 patients underwent surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The guideline protocol was not followed in 30 (37.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow up of patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> generally conformed to the guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow up of patients with low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was highly variable while management of those with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> followed the guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall we found a wide variability in the management and surveillance of CLO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early experience suggests that implementation of guidelines is helpful but there is still variation in practice </plain></SENT>
