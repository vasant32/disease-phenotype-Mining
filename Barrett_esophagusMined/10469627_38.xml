<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to establish a good animal model for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) and to test the hypothesis that iron over-nutrition enhances EAC formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With rats, esophagogastroduodenal anastomosis (EGDA) was accomplished by anastomosing the duodenum to the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Iron supplementation was given by i.p. injection of iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (4 mg Fe/kg/week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This model mimics the development of human EAC by introducing mixed reflux of gastric and duodenal contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 40 weeks after surgery, the body weight, food intake, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, total serum iron, transferrin saturation, serum albumin, and plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18185">gamma-tocopherol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> of the EGDA rats were not significantly different from those of the non-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals generally had only mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, except that the area surrounding the anastomosis opening had more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE), CLE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and EAC were diagnosed in 53.5, 34.9 and 25.6%, respectively, of the 43 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal iron supplementation significantly enhanced esophageal lesions with CLE, CLE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and EAC to 78.0, 53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>7 and 53.7%, respectively, of the 41 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were well-differentiated mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> at the squamocolumnar junction area, where most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EGDA avoids <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028709" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nutritional problems</z:e> seen in other animal models for EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We believe that direct anastomosis of squamous epithelium to columnar epithelium and mixed reflux of gastric and duodenal contents lead to the formation of CLE and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With this model, we demonstrated that iron supplementation significantly enhanced EAC formation, suggesting that iron over-nutrition could also be a risk factor for human EAC </plain></SENT>
