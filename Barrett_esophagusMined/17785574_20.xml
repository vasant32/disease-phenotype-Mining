<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that a decreased <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (MnSOD) level is associated with the increased incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate MnSOD supplementation as a chemopreventive agent to prevent oxidative injury and subsequent BE and EAC formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Our esophagoduodenal anastomotic (EDA) model was done on rats according to our established procedure and treated with Mn(III)tetrakis(4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30746">benzoic acid</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> (MnTBAP; 10 mg/kg, i.p. every 3 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologic changes were determined after the EDA model at 1, 3, and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine for DNA oxidative damage were determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi>-reactive substance assay and immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enzymatic activities of MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD were evaluated, and the rate of proliferation was determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was seen in 100% of the EDA rats, and morphologic transformation within the esophageal epithelium was observed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (40% of animals) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (40% of animals) identified after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreased oxidative damage, along with the decreased degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and incidence of BE (20%) and EAC (0%), was found in MnTBAP-treated EDA rats comparing with the saline-treated EDA control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreased proliferation (46%) and increased SOD enzymatic activities (25%) were also found in the EDA rats treated with MnTBAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MnTBAP protected rat esophageal epithelium from oxidative injury induced by EDA, and it could prevent the transformation of esophageal epithelial cell to BE to EAC by preservation of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
