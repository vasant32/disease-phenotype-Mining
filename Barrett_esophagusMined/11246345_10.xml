<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The precise role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is a matter of intense debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring has a higher accuracy than endoscopy for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, but the correlation between H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and esophageal pH-metric parameters has almost never been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and the presence of disturbances not only in endoscopy but also in 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred consecutive patients undergoing 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring because of symptoms suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal manometry was carried out to study the position and the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was evaluated by histology (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin stain) and rapid urease test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 50 +/- 15 years; 50% were men and 56% had an abnormal pH-metry (DeMeester score more than 14.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of H. pylori in patients with abnormal pH-metry was 57% (95% CI, 42-70%) and was 52% (95% CI, 39-64%) in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pH-metry (nonsignificant differences [NS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> did not correlate with an abnormal pH-metry (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4-1.8; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proportion of cases with abnormal pH-metry among infected patients was 54% (95% CI, 41-66%) and was 59% (95% CI, 44-72%) among uninfected patients (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean values of pH-metric parameters (+/-SD), respectively for H. pylori-positive and -negative patients, were total score (30 +/- 33 vs. 36 +/- 38), number of reflux episodes (7 +/- 7 vs. 11 +/- 11), number of episodes more than 5 minutes (3.7 +/- 5 vs. 3.8 +/- 5), longest reflux episode (2.4 +/- 2 minutes vs. 3.1 +/- 3 minutes), and fraction time (%) with pH less than 4 (total, 6 +/- 7 vs. 6.8 +/- 8; upright, 3.9 +/- 4 vs. 4.5 +/- 5; supine, 7.4 +/- 12 vs. 7.2 +/- 10) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> findings were NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings, respectively for H. pylori-positive and -negative, were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> (41% vs. 41%), endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (Savary-Miller) (54% vs. 46%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (15% vs. 11%) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> findings were NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, differences were not demonstrated in the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter (12 +/- 8 mmHg vs. 14 +/- 12 mmHg) among H. pylori-positive and -negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, as evaluated endoscopically and with 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
