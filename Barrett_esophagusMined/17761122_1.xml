<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spectrum-continuum conceptual model had a profound impact on the research priorities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, as well as on proposed diagnostic algorithms and therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Natural course studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> are almost always retrospective and commonly afflicted with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of shortcomings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors that affect quality of natural course studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> include the following: index endoscopy results are taken at face value; antireflux treatment is consumed until index endoscopy and/or offered during the follow-up phase; pathophysiologic, anatomic, and genetic factors are overlooked; and lack of confirmation of the durability of the new esophageal mucosal finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional heartburn is common and likely to affect a large subset of patients presenting with heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence to support progression of functional heartburn to nonerosive reflux disease (NERD), erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is very scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The largest population-based or longest-duration natural course studies report that only 10% of patients progress from NERD to erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients remained within their respective phenotypic presentations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
