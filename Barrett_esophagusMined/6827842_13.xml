<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (15 men and four women) satisfied the criteria of primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in columnar epithelium in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (95%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nearly three fourths of the patients also had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was confirmed preoperatively in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> by endoscopic biopsy and/or cytologic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potentially curative resection was performed in 15 patients and palliative procedures in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had advanced (Stage III) disease and only five had Stage I or II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multicentric disease within the esophagus was found in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications included <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyema</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (one case each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> resulted from complications of previously undetected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median survival of the 15 patients having resection for cure is 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four are alive, one with disease at 46 months and three free of disease at 19, 87, and 93 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients undergoing palliative procedures died within 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrates that multifocal presentation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is common in this group of patients and that long-term survival is possible when early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are managed aggressively </plain></SENT>
