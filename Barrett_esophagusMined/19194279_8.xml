<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and pathologic features, natural history, and DNA content flow cytometric abnormalities of BE patients with non-adenomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>) in a cohort of BE patients enrolled in a prospective surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> identified over a 6 year period, in a cohort of 270 consecutive patients with BE and without esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) at baseline, were evaluated for clinical and pathologic features, including association with conventional adenomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EA, DNA content flow cytometric abnormalities (tetraploidy and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>) and outcome, over a mean follow-up period of 4.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings in the 18 study patients were compared to those in the 252 remaining (control) patients without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control patients included 228 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>/indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 24 with conventional adenomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (13 low-grade, 11 high-grade) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> in our BE cohort was 6.7% Of the 18 study patients, there were 17 were males and 1 female of mean age 66.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean length of BE was 3.9 cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> foci were associated with goblet or non-goblet epithelium in 62% and 38% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four percent of patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> (17/18) also had conventional adenomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (four with low-grade, 13 with high-grade) elsewhere in the esophagus at the same endoscopic procedure as the one that detected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> had a significantly shorter length of BE compared to control patients with conventional adenomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (N=24) (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> also showed a significantly higher rate of DNA content flow cytometric abnormalities compared to the entire cohort of control patients (38% vs. 11%, p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no significant differences regarding either flow cytometric abnormalities or progression to EA were found when the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> patients were compared only to the 24 controls with conventional adenomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
