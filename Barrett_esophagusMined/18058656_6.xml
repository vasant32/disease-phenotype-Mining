<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary aims were to assess interobserver variability of capsule endoscopy readings and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 98 patients (53 men, 53 +/- 13 years) with an indication for EGD were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient population was artificially enriched to include two thirds of patients with abnormal esophageal findings at EGD, which was followed by capsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Capsule recordings were blindly read by three endoscopists, one from the center that recruited the patient and two from the other center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study outcomes were the findings described on EGD and capsule endoscopy, agreement between EGD and capsule endoscopy for findings, quality of the capsule recording, and interobserver agreement for capsule endoscopy quality and findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EGD was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 34 patients and showed esophageal findings in 62 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> 28, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> 21, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> 21, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> 11, others 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average esophageal transit time of the capsule was 361 +/- 393 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Capsule endoscopy was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 36 patients but detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 23, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> in 0, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> in 23, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 18, and others in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of capsule endoscopy was 80.0 % and the negative predictive value was 61.1 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall agreement per patient was moderate between EGD and capsule endoscopy for the per-patient (kappa = 0.42) and per-findings (kappa = 0.40) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement between capsule endoscopy readings was moderate for findings (kappa = 0.39) and quality assessment (kappa = 0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No adverse event was observed after either EGD or capsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, despite artificial prevalence enrichment, capsule endoscopy showed a moderate sensitivity and specificity in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
