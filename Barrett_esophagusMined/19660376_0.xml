<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Surgical management of massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> and complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> requires a tension-free repair with reliable reflux control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this observation was to evaluate the functional results of a modified Collis-Nissen gastroplasty with a transverse widening fundoplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1995 and 2007, 26 patients underwent a 3-cm cut elongation gastroplasty with a transverse widening of the fundus followed by a 3-cm total (n = 24) or partial (n = 2) fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications for the operation were symptomatic massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> (n = 4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 8), or correction of previously failed antireflux fundoplications (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was documented in 19 of the 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative assessment included symptoms, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> swallow, endoscopy, manometry, and 24-hour pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no postoperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications were recorded in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 105 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reflux symptoms present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before the operation were found in 5 patients postoperatively (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Radiologic assessment documented an intact fundoplication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lower esophageal sphincter gradient increased from a mean of 7.5 to 15 mm Hg (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Acid exposure (17% preoperatively) decreased significantly to 1% postoperatively (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Endoscopically, mucosal damage quantification decreased (3.1 preoperatively to 1.5 postoperatively; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mucosal breaks healed but the columnar-lined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This modified elongation gastroplasty provided a reliable repair for massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo>, shortened <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The lower esophageal sphincter gradient was restored and remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Reflux exposure was reduced, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mucosal damage disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Columnar-lined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
