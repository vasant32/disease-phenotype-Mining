<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is very little published data from New Zealand, with no published data from a non-Tertiary New Zealand hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of oesophagectomy at a single provincial hospital in New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective review of clinical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent oesophagectomy at Palmerston North Hospital (a level II provincial New Zealand public hospital) between 1993 and 2010 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, operative details, postoperative recovery parameters, survival data, pathological data, and details of adjuvant treatment were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 68 patients who underwent oesophagectomy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 63.6 plus or minus 10.9 years, and 69% of patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean operating time was 438.37 plus or minus 101.8 min, and mean intraoperative blood loss was 934.5 plus or minus 790.2 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median intensive care unit stay was 7 (1-29) days, and total day stay was 17.5 (4-60) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tracheostomy was performed in 20 patients (29.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic leak occurred in 7 patients (10.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo> in 6 patients (8.8%) and cardiopulmonary complications in 34 patients (50.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause in-hospital mortality rate was 4.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 30 days was 98.5%, at 1 year was 78.3% and at 5 years was 30.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Survival outcomes of oesophagectomy in this provincial New Zealand hospital are comparable to published series from national and international tertiary centres </plain></SENT>
