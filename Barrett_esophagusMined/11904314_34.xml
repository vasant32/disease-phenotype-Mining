<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, in which the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal epithelium is replaced with a columnar mucosa, are at increased risk for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mucosal injury may be involved in the progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> via the synthesis of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> and other mediators of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of inhibiting COX-2 activity in Barrett's esophageal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary esophageal epithelial and fibroblast cell cultures were established from endoscopic biopsy specimens from 20 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>COX-2 expression and activity were determined on pooled cell cultures by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2)) enzyme immunoassay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation was measured by Ki-67 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) levels were determined in supernatants from epithelial cells treated with the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398, proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1beta and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha), and conditioned medium from fibroblast cultures (both unstimulated and stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Esophageal epithelial cells and fibroblasts expressed COX-2 messenger <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with control-treated cells, NS-398 decreased proliferation of Barrett's esophageal epithelial cells by 55% (95% confidence interval = 47.1% to 63.8%; P&lt;.001) and decreased COX-2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The addition of exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) reversed the antiproliferative effect of NS-398 on Barrett's esophageal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Proinflammatory cytokines did not affect COX-2 activity in esophageal epithelial cells but stimulated COX-2 activity in fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, conditioned medium from unstimulated and stimulated fibroblasts increased COX-2 activity in esophageal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: COX-2 is functionally active in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> because treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor hinders proliferation of Barrett's esophageal epithelial cells in culture, but proliferation is restored by treatment with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results raise the possibility that inhibition of COX-2 may have chemopreventive potential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
