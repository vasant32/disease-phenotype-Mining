<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical and light microscopic features of the 24 HGM cases were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to overall secretion of neutral mucins by the 24 HGM cases, mucin histochemistry showed prominent secretion of acidic mucins in 19 of 24 HGM cases (79%), with sulphomucins in 11 of 24 HGM cases (45.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This mucin profile of HGM was unlike that of either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa or heterotopic gastric mucosa in Meckel's diverticula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a comparison between the mucin profile and clinical features of HGM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> showed certain similarities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data suggest a physiopathologic link between HGM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
