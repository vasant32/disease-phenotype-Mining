<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The neosquamous mucosa that replaces ablated esophageal endothelium after endoscopic mucosal ablation for Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) may retain buried glandular tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the neoplastic potential, cellular proliferation, and resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of this buried glandular tissue by measuring COX-2, Ki-67, and BCL-2 expression in these tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospectively collected database was sourced for esophageal biopsy specimens with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> histologic appearance, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, HGD, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and postablation mucosa comprising ablated Barrett's and ablated HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of cellular markers was achieved immunohistochemically using monoclonal antibodies for the COX-2 enzyme (suggesting increased neoplastic potential), Ki-67 antigen (suggesting cellular proliferation), and BCL-2 oncoprotein (suggesting oncogenic resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grading was performed by independent, blinded observers, and the pre- and postablation cellular disparities were subsequently noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The buried glandular elements of postablation mucosa demonstrated universally greater COX-2, Ki-67, and BCL-2 expression than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> expressed significantly greater COX-2 and Ki-67 at the deep glandular level than postablation mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HGD demonstrated greater Ki-67 expression than the postablation tissue but only within the superficial glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the expression of COX-2 correlated significantly with Ki-67 expression in deep glandular tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ablation of pathologic mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and HGD reduces the expression of some markers of neoplastic behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the buried glandular tissue of the postablation mucosa still exhibits a higher expression than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This has potential implications for the follow-up treatment of these patients because it is unclear whether the true risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> is adequately reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A more comprehensive study is required to address this issue </plain></SENT>
