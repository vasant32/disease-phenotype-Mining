<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A molecular understanding of both the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and the factors determining the response of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> to neoadjuvant therapy is required, and this study focused on the role of proteins regulated by the bcl-2 family of genes, which are important regulators of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 48 patients (36 men, 12 women) with Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2, bax and bcl-x protein expression were detected by standard avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> peroxidase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2, bax and bcl-x expression were detected in 84%, 80%, and 76%, respectively, of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increasing degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's mucosa both before and after chemoradiotherapy was significantly associated with a reduction of bcl-2 expression (P = 0.03 and 0.009, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation (P = 0.03) and a trend towards earlier T stage (P = 0.08), but not with nodal status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pre-therapeutic bcl-2, bax and bcl-x protein expression (27%, 75%, and 87.5%, respectively) were not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response or resistance to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2-positive patients had a significantly improved survival compared with bcl-2-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction of bcl-2 expression is associated with the progression of Barrett's mucosa to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Preoperative chemoradiotherapy induces expression of bax and bcl-x protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The pretreatment expression of bcl-2 and related proteins did not predict response or resistance to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, suggesting that regulators of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> alone do not determine the response of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> to neoadjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
