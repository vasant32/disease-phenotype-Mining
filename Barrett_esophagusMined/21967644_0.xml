<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In reporting our initial results, safety, initial oncologic completeness, and preliminary outcomes with a minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 2007 to 2010, 40 minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomies were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The approach was a laparoscopic mobilization of the stomach and a thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization and creation of a high intrathoracic anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in 39 patients and esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100723'>gastrointestinal stromal tumor</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 62 (range 39-77) with 31 (78%) male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-emergent conversion was required in two (5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five (63%) patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean operative time was 364 minutes (range 285-455), and mean blood loss was 205 cc (range 100-400) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent an R0 resection including the removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and mean number of nodes harvested was 21 (range 11-41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median intensive care unit stay was 1 day (range 1-3), and hospital stay was 7 days (range 6-19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no anastomotic leaks and no 30-day mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications included eight (21%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and two (5%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo>, one requiring ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 16.5 months (range 1-39 months), five (13%) patients have had a distant recurrence; there have been no local recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy, although technically challenging, can be carried out with reasonable operative times, a short length of stay, and minimal complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Final oncologic validity is pending longer follow-up and a larger series </plain></SENT>
