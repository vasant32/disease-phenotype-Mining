<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade, laparoscopy has proven an accurate staging modality for detecting peritoneal carcinosis and small metastatic liver deposits unsuspected at preoperative investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has led to a change in surgical strategy in up to 20% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, by means of laparoscopic techniques, it is possible to mobilize the stomach and perform a safe transhiatal mediastinal dissection at least up to the level of the inferior pulmonary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Laparoscopy-assisted esophagectomy was attempted in 43 patients over the past 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The esophagectomy was performed via laparoscopy combined with right thoracotomy (group A) or with left cervicotomy and transmediastinal endodissection (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall conversion rate to laparotomy was 11.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The morbidity rate was 20% in group A and 30.7% in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean hospital stay was 11 in group A and 10 days in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients died between 11 and 19 months after surgery with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No port-site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were recorded during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This approach has proven feasible and safe in the medium-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further experience and a longer follow-up are needed to assess the impact of these procedures on long-term survival </plain></SENT>
