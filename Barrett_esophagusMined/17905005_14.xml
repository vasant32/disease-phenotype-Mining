<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: EMR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE)-related superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> represents an efficacious staging modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It also allows for better pathologic grading compared with mucosal biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the interobserver variation in the interpretation of EMR specimens has not been tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate consistency in the diagnosis of BE-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> on EMR specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Nine pathologists reviewed 25 esophageal EMR specimens and corresponding biopsy specimens independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each pathologist classified the cases as either non-neoplastic BE, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, or invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interobserver concordance for both specimens from EMRs and biopsies was measured by intraclass correlation and Kendall's coefficient of concordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of agreement was also calculated for each specimen and compared for EMR and biopsy by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Teaching hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twenty-five patients who underwent EMR for BE-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intraclass correlation and the Kendall's coefficient for the 25 biopsy specimens was 0.938 (95% CI 0.880-0.965) and 0.677, respectively; for the 25 EMRs, these were significantly improved, at 0.977 (95% CI 0.957-0.987) and 0.831, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the proportion of agreement for EMR specimens was significantly better compared with biopsy specimens (P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Interobserver agreement of BE-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> on EMR specimens is significantly higher compared with biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results may relate to the larger tissue sampling compared with biopsy specimens and the ability to evaluate mucosal landmarks, such as double muscularis mucosae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, we suggest that EMRs, in addition to being a staging and therapeutic procedure, improve diagnostic consistency </plain></SENT>
