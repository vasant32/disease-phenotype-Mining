<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Basal acid output was determined by nasogastric suction in 228 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> who received upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and were diagnosed with either pyrosis alone (N = 98), erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> with or without pyrosis (N = 87), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (N = 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean basal acid output for the 228 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> was 6.5 +/- 5.6 meq/hr, which was significantly different from 65 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects with a mean basal acid output of 3.0 +/- 2.7 meq/hr (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, mean basal acid outputs significantly differed for patients with pyrosis (P &lt; 0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant difference in mean basal acid output between the patients with pyrosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of the 98 patients with pyrosis (19%), 24 of the 87 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (28%), and 15 of the 43 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (35%) had gastric acid hypersecretion (basal acid output greater than 10.0 meq/hr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> in doses that resulted in complete healing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and disappearance of pyrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three patients responded to <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> 300 mg/day; however, 53 patients required increased dose of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> (mean 1205 mg/day, range 600-3000 mg/day).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
