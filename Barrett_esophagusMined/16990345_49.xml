<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2) has been suggested as an early marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), which is the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of ectopic Cdx2 expression in the esophageal epithelial cells and its role in the development of BE remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR, pyrosequencing and methylation-specific PCR were used to determine expression and promoter methylation of Cdx2 in human esophageal epithelial cells (HET1A and SEG1) after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (DAC), acid, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and their combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HET1A cells with stable transfection of Cdx2 were characterized for <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and gene expression profiles with Affymetrix array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found Cdx2 was expressed in most human EAC cell lines, but not in squamous epithelial cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DAC-induced demethylation and expression of Cdx2 in HET1A and SEG1 cells, and treatment with a DNA methylating agent counteracted the effect of DAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of HET1A and SEG1 cells with acid, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> or both also resulted in promoter demethylation and expression of Cdx2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HET1A cells with stable transfection of human Cdx2 formed crypt-like structures in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR showed that stable transfection of Cdx2 up-regulated differentiation markers of intestinal columnar epithelial cells and goblet cells in HET1A cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may be partially due to modulation of Notch signaling pathway, as western blotting confirmed down-regulation of Hes1 and up-regulation of Atoh1 and Muc2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that exposure to acid and/or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> may activate Cdx2 expression in human esophageal epithelial cells through promoter demethylation, and ectopic Cdx2 expression in esophageal squamous epithelial cells may contribute to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
