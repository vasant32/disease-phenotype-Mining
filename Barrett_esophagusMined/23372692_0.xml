<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is transition from squamous to columnar mucosa as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of microRNA during this transition has not been systematically studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: For initial screening, total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from 5 GERD and 6 BE patients was size fractionated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> &lt;70 nucleotides was subjected to SOLiD 3 library preparation and next generation sequencing (NGS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics analysis was performed using R package "DEseq" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A p value&lt;0.05 adjusted for a false discovery rate of 5% was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NGS-identified miRNA were validated using qRT-PCR in an independent group of 40 GERD and 27 BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA expression of human BE tissues was also compared with three BE cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NGS detected 19.6 million raw reads per sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>53.1% of filtered reads mapped to miRBase version 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NGS analysis followed by qRT-PCR validation found 10 differentially expressed miRNA; several are novel (-708-5p, -944, -224-5p and -3065-5p) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Up- or down- regulation predicted by NGS was matched by qRT-PCR in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Human BE tissues and BE cell lines showed a high degree of concordance (70-80%) in miRNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prediction analysis identified targets that mapped to developmental signaling pathways such as TGFβ and Notch and inflammatory pathways such as toll-like receptor signaling and TGFβ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis found similarly regulated (up or down) miRNA to share common targets suggesting coordination between miRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using highly sensitive next-generation sequencing, we have performed a comprehensive genome wide analysis of microRNA in BE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Differentially expressed miRNA between BE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> have been further validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Expression of miRNA between BE human tissues and BE cell lines are highly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These miRNA should be studied in biological models to further understand BE development </plain></SENT>
