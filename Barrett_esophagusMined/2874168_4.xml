<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Simple lifestyle modifications decrease reflux episodes and should serve as the cornerstone for medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antacids or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17548">alginic acid</z:chebi> may be helpful in mild disease but recent studies suggest they may be no better than placebo </plain></SENT>
