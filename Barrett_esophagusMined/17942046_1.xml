<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to present our experience in the surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: Of a group of 128 patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 8 (6.2%) developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> during a median follow-up of 7 years (2-25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A further 5 patients with high-grade dysplaing out side the study were referred for evaluation and surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were under medical treatment with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (40 mg daily) while the remaining 5 patients had undergone open Nissen fundoplication, with a diagnosis of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at a median of 5 years (1-16) after treatment initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After confirmation of the diagnosis by a second pathologist and tumoral staging, transthoracic esophagectomy with anastomosis at the apex of the thorax was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative mortality was nil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Morbidity was 36% (5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Definitive histological analysis of the surgical specimen revealed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 7 patients (54%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 6 (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients remain alive after a median follow-up of 4.7 years (1-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the best therapeutic option is surgical resection, which can be performed with nil mortality in experienced centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In almost half of surgical patients, the surgical specimen shows <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival is higher than 90% </plain></SENT>
