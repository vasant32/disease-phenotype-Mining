<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore the relationship between GER and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory disorders</z:e>, we histologically examined the bilateral lungs of a rat gastroduodenal contents reflux model, which was previously used to investigate the histogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GER was surgically induced in male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bilateral lungs of the reflux rats were examined with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (HE), <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-Alcian blue, and Azan staining at 10 and 20 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining of CD68 and Î±-SMA was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>Aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> with severe peribronchiolar neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltrates, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_139'>goblet cell hyperplasia</z:mpath>, prominence of blood vessels, and increased thickness of the smooth muscle layer were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011946'>Bronchiolitis obliterans</z:hpo> (BO)-like lesions comprising <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> with macrophages, spindle cells, and multinucleated giant cells in the lumen of respiratory bronchioles were observed in the bilateral lungs of the reflux animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and the BO-like lesions may play a role in exacerbation of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) in human cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we speculate that repetitive microaspiration due to GER may contribute to the exacerbation of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory diseases</z:e>, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD), and the development of BO syndrome following lung transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reflux model is a good tool for examining the causal relationships between GER and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
