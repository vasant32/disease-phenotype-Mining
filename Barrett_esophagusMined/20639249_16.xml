<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reported incidence rates of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OAC) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) vary widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the effectiveness of BO surveillance is crucially dependent on this rate, its clarification is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To estimate the rate of malignant progression in patients with BO, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a first diagnosis of BO with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND) or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) between 1991 and 2006 were identified in the Dutch nationwide registry of histopathology (PALGA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were evaluated up to November 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 42 207 patients with BO were included; 4132 (8%) of them had LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Re-evaluation endoscopies at least 6 months after initial diagnosis were performed in 16 365 patients (39%), who were significantly younger than those not re-examined (58+/-13 vs 63+/-16 years, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients were followed-up for a total of 78 131 person-years, during which 666 (4%) high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD)/OACs occurred, affecting 4% of the surveillance patient population (mean age: 69+/-12 years, 76% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After excluding HGD/OAC cases detected within 1 year after BO diagnosis (n=212, 32%), incidence rates per 1000 person-years were 4.3 (95% CI 3.4 to 5.5) for OAC and 5.8 (95% CI 4.6 to 7.0) for HGD/OAC combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for HGD/OAC were increased age (eg, &gt;75 years HR 12; 95% CI 8.0 to 18), male sex (2.01; 1.68 to 2.60) and presence of LGD at baseline (1.91; 1.53 to 2.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this largest reported cohort of unselected patients with BO, the annual risk of OAC was 0.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Male sex, older age and LGD at diagnosis are independent predictors of malignant progression, and should enable an improved risk assessment in BO </plain></SENT>
