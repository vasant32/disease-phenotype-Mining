<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, mAb Das-1 reacts with abnormal cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010692" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cystitis</z:e> profunda, as well as so-called 'oval cells' in the adult liver, which are considered oncogenic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To establish ontogenic regulation of mAb Das-1 reactivity, we studied 7- to 24-week-old human fetuses by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In liver, mAb Das-1 reactivity was further correlated with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphatase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi> transpeptidase expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>mAb Das-1 reacted with cells in organs arising from the pharyngeal cleft (thymus), primitive gut (oral cavity, pharynx, lung, esophagus, stomach, biliary tree, pancreas, liver, colon), ureteric bud (renal tubules, collecting duct), mesonephros (kidney, testis), mesoderm (muscle) and elsewhere (skin, adrenal cortex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In distinction from the adult liver, mAb Das-1 staining was more pronounced in hepatoblasts compared with biliary cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In adult tissues, however, mAb Das-1 reactivity was restricted to the colon, biliary epithelium, keratinocytes, and ciliary body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicated that the mAb Das-1 recognized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in fetal cells of diverse ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal origin, compatible with sharing of lineage mechanisms in tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reactivation of mAb Das-1 staining in epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous conditions</z:e>, including <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> arising in these organs, is compatible with oncofetal regulation of the antigen, which will facilitate analysis of cell subpopulations during organ development, regeneration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
