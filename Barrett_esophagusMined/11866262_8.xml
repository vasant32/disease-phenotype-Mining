<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether the use of ablation was increasing in a cohort of gastroenterologists, and to identify physician beliefs and characteristics associated with ablation use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We surveyed a national sample of gastroenterologists about ablation use, with an 18-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The self-administered instrument included questions about demographic characteristics, attitudes about ablation therapy, and prior experience with ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case scenarios were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with the use of ablation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-nine (50.3% of those eligible) responded to the baseline survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Few agreed that ablation lowers the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (15%) or is supported by the medical literature (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 25% of respondents reportedly had used ablation at baseline, and this increased to 36% in the follow-up survey (p = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of ablation was significantly associated with physician age greater than 54 yr (odds ratio [OR] = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.04-7.37) and the belief that ablation was used by colleagues (OR = 13.27, 95% CI = 4.44-39.64) or decreases medical costs (OR = 5.07, 95% CI = 1.00-25.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although few gastroenterologists agreed that ablation is effective, a significant proportion had adopted its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in ablation use during our study period, and the characteristic that was most strongly associated with ablation use was the belief that colleagues used it </plain></SENT>
