<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A set of helical microwave antennas was designed to investigate their potential use in the thermal therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For treatment, a balloon filled with muscle-equivalent material encapsulates the antenna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of insertion depth and coil-spacing on the thermal distribution produced by the antennas (20-35 mm) were characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 35 mm helical antenna, with a coil-spacing of 3.6 mm resulted in uniform heating for an insertion depth of 40 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was observed that the resultant temperature distribution produced, by the antennas, was dependent on the insertion depth within the phantom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> antennas studied, deeper insertion resulted in two high intensity regions, approximately 1/4 and 3/4 along the antenna length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, shallow insertion resulted in predominant tip heating with undesirable heating at the phantom entry point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, by manipulating the coil-spacing of the helix, uniform temperature profiles were achieved for a range of insertion depths </plain></SENT>
