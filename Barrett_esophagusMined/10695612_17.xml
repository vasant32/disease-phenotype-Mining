<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two biopsy specimens of the distal esophagus from 38 patients were tested by immunoperoxidase method using MAbDAS-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four samples of cardia-type mucosa biopsied from the stomach were used as controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 52 specimens, 29 had glandular epithelium and the rest had only squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
