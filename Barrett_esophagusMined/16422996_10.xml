<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To estimate the economic burden caused by patients with erosive and non-erosive reflux disease, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease</z:e> study includes a total of 6,215 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, patients were categorized as non-erosive reflux disease, erosive reflux disease, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> according to endoscopic findings alone or as confirmed by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct and indirect disease-related costs were calculated based on 5,273 patients with complete information in the second year of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 73% of the Progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease</z:e> patients had taken <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> medication, 61% had visited a doctor, and 2% had been hospitalized because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> during the previous 12 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This health resource utilization caused direct costs of 342+/-864 (mean+/-s.d.) and indirect costs of 40+/-473 per patient and year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total costs for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> or erosive reflux disease were higher than those for patients with non-erosive reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> frequently need long-term medication and doctor care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The disorder is associated with a considerable health economic burden to society </plain></SENT>
