<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE are frequently treated with acid suppressants, but it is unclear whether these prevent the development of BE-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether acid suppression reduces the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a multicenter prospective cohort study of 540 patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We collected information on medication use at each surveillance visit, which was cross-checked with pharmacy records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients also completed a questionnaire about their use of over-the-counter medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were identified during a median follow-up period of 5.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to investigate the effect of acid suppression on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients (7%) developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi>-2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> did not affect the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) at inclusion in the study or during the follow-up period reduced the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.93 and hazard ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prolonged use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> and good adherence were associated with an additional protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> decreased during <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use, but length of BE was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a multicenter prospective cohort study, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use was associated with a reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
