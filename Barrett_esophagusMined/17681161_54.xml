<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Aside from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux, the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case-control study investigated body mass index (BMI), central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, and cigarette smoking and risk of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Washington residents newly diagnosed with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> on at least 1 of 4 esophageal biopsy specimens taken at community gastroenterology clinics (cases [n = 193]) were compared with matched population controls (n = 211) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case subgroups included those with any visible columnar epithelium (visible BE) and those with at least 2 cm of columnar epithelium (long-segment BE [LSBE]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interviewers conducted personal interviews and took anthropometric measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measures of central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> were strongly related to BE risk, particularly for LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the high category of waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), the adjusted odds ratios were 2.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-3.9) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, 2.8 (95% CI: 1.5-5.1) for visible BE, and 4.3 (95% CI: 1.9-9.9) for LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the associations with BMI were weaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When BMI and WHR were modeled simultaneously, the associations with BMI were greatly attenuated, whereas those with WHR remained strong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for frequency of heartburn did not change these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking moderately increased risk but with no evidence of a dose-dependent response or increasing strength by case group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations indicate the importance of identifying the mechanisms underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>'s role in BE and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> might be a fruitful approach to the prevention of these diseases </plain></SENT>
