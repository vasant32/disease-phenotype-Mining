<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is an important risk factor for Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of adiponectin (anti-inflammatory adipokine from adipose tissue) and ghrelin (orexigenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> gastric origin) on the progression of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> has not been investigated so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was: (1) to compare the expression of adiponectin and ghrelin receptors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium; (2) to assess the effect of adiponectin and ghrelin on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells in vitro; and (3) to investigate the effect of ghrelin on IL-1beta and COX-2 expression in OE-19 cells incubated with TNFalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of ghrelin and adiponectin receptors (GHS-R1a, Adipo-R1, Adipo R-2) in biopsies from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line OE-19 was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The OE-19 cells were also incubated with adiponectin (5-10 microg/ml), and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and proliferation were assessed by FACS and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, effects of adiponectin on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of proapoptotic Bax and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two different in vitro models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> the OE-19 cells were incubated with ghrelin alone or in the presence of TNFalpha or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or pulse acidified medium, and the expression of IL-1beta and COX-2 as markers for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were assessed by FACS and qRT-PCR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adiponectin caused a significant increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and this affect was accompanied by increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ghrelin had no effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of OE-19 cells incubated in neutral or acidified medium with or without addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level, the expression of adiponectin receptors (Adipo-R1, Adipo-R2) was decreased, and the expression of ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) was increased in Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin caused a decrease in TNFalpha-induced COX-2 and IL-1beta expression in OE-19 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adiponectin and ghrelin have an inhibitory effect on Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> by two different mechanisms: (1) by an increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by adiponectin, and (2) by anti-inflammatory actions of ghrelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The decrease in levels of these two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may explain the progression of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
