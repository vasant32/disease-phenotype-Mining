<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median age was 66 years (range, 30 to 79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heartburn was the most common presenting symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Esophagoscopy at the time of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> diagnosis demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Barrett's mucosa in 10 patients (53%), shallow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in 3, slight mucosal irregularities in 2, small mucosal nodules in 2, stricture in 1, and shallow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> with stricture in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients underwent esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (50%) had invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postsurgical stage was stage 0 in 9 patients, stage I in 6, stage IIA in 2, and stage IIB in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 34 months (range, 2 to 116 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458156" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Recurrent cancer</z:e> developed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall 5-year survival was 66.7%; 5-year survival for patients with stage 0 disease was 100% and for stage I and II disease, 35.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in an indication for esophageal resection because of the high rate of associated early invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and that resection can be done safely with the expectation of excellent long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of these findings, we continue to recommend endoscopic surveillance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
