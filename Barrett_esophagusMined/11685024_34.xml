<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To quantify the occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) during endoscopic surveillance and to evaluate the impact of antireflux surgery on the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The malignant potential in segments of CLE is mainly restricted to those containing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with segments of CLE in which no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> can be detected are rarely enrolled in a surveillance program but may still be at increased risk of developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> because <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> may be missed or may develop with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy samples was determined on repeated endoscopies in 177 patients enrolled in a surveillance program for CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in patients with no evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> on the two first endoscopies was evaluated on the subsequent endoscopies and compared in patients with medically and surgically treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was found in 53% of the patients (94/177) on their first surveillance endoscopy and was more prevalent in long segments of CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> increased markedly with increasing number of surveillance endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> tended to be detected early in patients with long segments of CLE; in patients with shorter segments, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was also detected late in the course of endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with surgically treated reflux disease were 10.3 times less likely to develop <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> compared with a group receiving standard medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Biopsy samples from a single endoscopy, despite an adequate biopsy protocol, are insufficient to rule out the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom biopsy specimens from a segment of CLE show no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> have a significant risk of having undetected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or of developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sampling error is probably the reason for the absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in segments of CLE longer than 4 cm, whereas development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> is common in patients with shorter segments of CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Antireflux surgery protects against the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, possibly by better control of reflux of gastric contents </plain></SENT>
