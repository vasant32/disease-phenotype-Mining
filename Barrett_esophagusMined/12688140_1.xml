<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BE has been defined as the complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most serious complication of BE is esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present our results with the group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> from the years 1998-2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We prospectively followed 67 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (group A) and 8 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>/BE (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent laparoscopic fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average length of the Barrett's segment was 4.3 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average time of the surgery was 75 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nissen fundoplication was used in seven cases in group B, in one case we used Rossetti laparoscopic fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The postoperative endoscopic controls were performed at two months after surgery and then every one-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In one case we observed the complete reepithelization with the mixed spinocelullar and columnar components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We didn't observe any one case of histological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was on any difference between two groups regarding the subjective complains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Six patients form group B reported complete disappearing of pyrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients reported significant improvement, with very rare pyrosis or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our experience (together with the literature) proved the surgical antireflux therapy is very safe, very effective and with very long lasting effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The effectivity of surgical therapy is increased by the laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Described laparoscopic approaches can lead to the reepithelization of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or, at least, they can diminish the symptoms without any long-term medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Surveillance endoscopy and biopsy are strictly recommended in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with BE and also in the patients with BE after antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The intervals depend on the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
