<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the incidences of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EAC and investigated factors associated with progression of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The BE study is a multicenter outcomes project of a large cohort of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasia</z:hpo> was graded as low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), or EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients followed up for at least 1 year after the index endoscopy examination were included, whereas those diagnosed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EAC within 1 year of diagnosis with BE (prevalent cases) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 3334 patients with BE, 1204 met the inclusion criteria (93.7% Caucasian; 88% male; mean age, 59.3 y) and were followed up for a mean of 5.52 years (6644.5 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients developed EAC (incidence, 0.27%/y; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.43) and 32 developed HGD (incidence, 0.48%/y; 95% CI, 0.34-0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of HGD and EAC was 0.63%/y (95% CI, 0.47-0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 217 cases of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (incidence, 3.6%/y; 95% CI, 3.2-4.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five and 10 years after diagnosis, 98.6% (n = 540) and 97.1% (n = 155) of patients with NDBE were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> free, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The length of the BE was associated significantly with progression (EAC &lt;6 cm, 0.09%/y vs EAC â‰¥ 6 cm, 0.65%/y; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a lower incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EAC among patients with NDBE than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because most patients are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> free after a long-term follow-up period, surveillance intervals might be lengthened, especially for patients with shorter segments of BE </plain></SENT>
