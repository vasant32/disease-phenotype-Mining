<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, when alcian-blue is utilized, another type of cells, called columnar blue cells, is frequently present in the distal esophagus of patients with endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytokeratin 7 and 20 immunoreactivity has been previously studied in areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the expression of these cytokeratins in columnar blue cells has not been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the expression of cytokeratin 7 and 20 in goblet cells and columnar blue cells in patients with endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsies from 86 patients with endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The biopsies were stained for cytokeratin 7 and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Goblet cells were present in 75 cases and columnar blue cells in 50 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, cytokeratin 7 expression was similar in goblet cells and columnar blue cells (P = 0.25), while cytokeratin 20 was more common in goblet cells (P &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In individuals with both cell types, however, cytokeratin 7 staining was the same in goblet and columnar blue cells in 95% of the cases, and cytokeratin 20 staining was the same in 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Goblet cells and columnar blue cells have similar immunohistochemical staining patterns for cytokeratins 7 and 20 in patients with endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
