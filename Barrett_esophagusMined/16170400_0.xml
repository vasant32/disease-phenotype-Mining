<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> is determined primarily in accordance with the degree of dysplastic alterations of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indication of "preventive" extirpation of the esophagus should be supported by other factors, for example by detection of p53 mutation or expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study reports on the evaluation of a group of 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> treated at the 1st Department of Surgery, the p53 level and its correlation with histological findings evaluated in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A good correlation was found between the grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and high p53 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This correlation was also confirmed by detection of early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in patients with "preventive" extirpation of the esophagus due to a high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results show that examination of p53 level in specimens taken from the esophageal mucosa may be helpful for the estimation of malignant potential of the dysplastic mucosa </plain></SENT>
