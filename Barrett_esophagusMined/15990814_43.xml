<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Accurate staging of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is important in the selection of patients for endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and biopsy specimen proven high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in focal nodular lesions or in endoscopically unapparent flat lesions in short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were initially staged with EUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with disease limited to the mucosa on EUS, cap-assisted EMR was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion on EMR specimens was classified in a similar manner to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137,C0751688" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous-cell cancer</z:e> of the esophagus: m1 (epithelial layer, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>), m2 (lamina propria invasion), m3 (muscularis mucosae invasion), sm (submucosal invasion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EUS was performed in 48 consecutive patients (27 with focal nodular lesions and 21 with microscopic lesions), and submucosal invasion was diagnosed in 8 (confirmed in 7/8 at surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EMR was carried out in the remaining 40 patients without significant complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 25 patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on prior biopsy specimens, EMR confirmed m1 disease in 19; whereas in 6 (24%), invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was detected (to m2 in 4; to m3 in 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> on prior biopsy specimens and staged as intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> on EUS, intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was confirmed in 9 (m2 in 3; m3 in 6); whereas, in 6 patients (40%), submucosal invasion was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, EUS provided accurate staging in 41/48 patients (85%) with one patient overstaged and 6 patients understaged compared with pathologic staging obtained by surgery or EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 34 patients with m1 to m3 staging after EMR, 29 were treated endoscopically and had no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> after a mean follow-up of 22.9 months(standard deviation 9.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EMR provides pathologic staging information that, in addition, may be helpful after EUS if a stage-determined approach is used in the management of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EMR may be particularly useful for staging of focal nodules or in short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with microscopic lesions when endoscopic therapy is an option </plain></SENT>
