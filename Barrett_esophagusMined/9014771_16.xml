<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Seven patients with Barrett's metaplastic epithelium and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were investigated by means of laser induced fluorescence after low dose intravenous injection (0.35 mg/kg bw) of Photofrin (QLT, Vancouver, Canada) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laser induced fluorescence measurements were performed immediately after resection of the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Laser induced fluorescence spectra were recorded from 15-30 locations in each surgical specimen from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, Barrett's epithelium, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological examination was performed on each location to correlate the fluorescence spectral characteristics with histological status of the epithelium (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, metaplastic or malignant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were also performed during endoscopy in five patients to test the applicability of the method in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence spectra were recorded and evaluated at characteristic wavelengths, and biopsy specimens were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence ratios were calculated as the quotient of Photofrin fluorescence divided by autofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean (SD) fluorescence ratio values were 0.10 (0.058) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal mucosa, 0.16 (0.073) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa, 0.205 (0.17) for Barrett's epithelium with moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 0.79 (0.54) for severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 0.78 (0.56) for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest fluorescence ratios were obtained for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissue, which could generally be distinguished from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonmalignant tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Metaplastic Barrett's epithelium also yielded higher fluorescence ratios than did <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the technique can be used during endoscopy for real time tissue characterisation in the oesophagus, as an aid in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> not macroscopically apparent at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
