<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The special attention was paid to the type and intensity of esophageal mucosa injury and the quantity of the pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect of the Nissen Rossetti fundoplication on postoperative changes in esophageal mucosa was also estimated on the average 18 months after the antireflux procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre and postoperative efficiency of the antireflux mechanism and patients conditions were evaluated on the grounds of anamnesis, physical examination, x-ray examination, endoscopy with biopsy, 24 hours pH metry, LES and body of the esophagus manometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were shown as mean and standard deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was determined using SPSS/PC-packet, Smirnow-Kolmogorow and Wilcoxon test, with p values &lt; 0.05 considered as significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the operation complete and durable relief of reflux symptoms was obtained in 83% patients, with high significant decrease of DeMeester score from 21.15 +/- 12.19 to 3.43 +/- 5.22, p &lt; 0.0002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy following the operation confirmed significant regression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> pathology, mainly in II and III degree according to Savary Miller classification, from 98.1% to 18.9%, p &lt; 0.005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison with other types of the pathology, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was always connected with significant higher quantity of the pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> before as well as after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biopsy following the operation revealed not significant regression of mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> lesions in 54.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The healing changes were observed first of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the most severe esophageal injuries-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (64%), CLE except intestinal type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (86.&amp;%) and low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of squamous epithelium (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The absence of regression after the operation was always combined with unsatisfactory decrease of 24 hour pH metry parameters: DeMeester score, percentage of total time pH &lt; 4.0 and time pH &lt; 4.0 in supine position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postoperative progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> pathology was noticed in 12.6% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One third patients had the same biopsy outcome before and after the operation, even in those without any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Biopsy in correlation with 24 hour pH metry analysis similarly like endoscopy revealed in CLE twice higher DeMeester score than squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The study proved that more advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> pathology were connected with higher quantity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results presented in this study confirmed high efficacy of the Nissen Rossetti fundoplication in surgical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We would to emphasize that with unsatisfactory biopsy results following the operation should be the reason for permanent follow up endoscopic and histopathologic verification </plain></SENT>
