<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current literature lacks good data documenting long-term outcomes in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This makes it difficult to counsel some patients about realistic treatment expectations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to evaluate our institutional experience and define the natural history and treatment outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical data obtained from children who underwent dilation for PS was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the past 30 years, 114 children and adolescents received 486 dilations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common indications for stricture dilation were PS (42%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other lesser indications included congenital, foreign body, corrosive, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, radiation, allergic, and infectious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on the 48 children with PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the children with PS, a congenital anomaly was identified in 23 children; and 12 had neurologic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Average age at presentation was 10.2 years (range, 0.5-18.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most patients had had symptoms for many months before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Peptic stricture was most common in the lower esophagus (n = 39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, middle (n = 8) and upper (n = 1) strictures were occasionally identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Noncompliance with medical therapy was a challenge in 12% (n = 5) of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Children with a PS received a median of 3 dilations, but a subset of 5 patients with severe strictures underwent up to 48 dilations (range, 1-48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Repeated dilations were required for a median of 20 months (range, 1-242 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Among patients receiving <z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>esophageal dilation</z:mp> for PS, 94% required an antireflux procedure (19% required a second antireflux surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of patients (n = 10) was identified who required extended dilations, multiple surgeries, and esophageal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This subgroup had a significantly longer period of symptomatic disease and increased risk of esophageal resection compared with those patients requiring fewer dilations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> was ultimately required in 3 children with PS after failure of more conservative measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents presenting with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> (PS) frequently require antireflux surgery, redo antireflux surgery, and multiple dilations for recurrent symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>We hope that these data will be of use to the clinician attempting to counsel patients and parents about treatment expectations in this challenging patient population </plain></SENT>
