<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study details the long-term outcomes in patients who underwent antireflux surgery with Collis gastroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients undergoing esophagogastric fundoplication (EGF) with a Collis gastroplasty for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> or paraesophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> were identified from a prospectively maintained database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptom questionnaires were used during follow-up to assess symptomatic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">Barium</z:chebi> esophogram, upper endoscopy with biopsy, and catheterless esophageal acid monitoring (BRAVO system) were recommended for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with abnormal results of physiologic studies underwent further treatment based on a standardized algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between 1996 and 2002, a total of 68 patients underwent EGF with Collis gastroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (40%) had a large paraesophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo>, and 20 (30%) had undergone a prior EGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six (82%) of the procedures were performed laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up time was 30 months, with 10 (15%) patients lost to latest follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic outcome data were available for 85% of patients, with significant improvements reported for heartburn (86%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (90%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (89%), and regurgitation (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most patients (84%) were off medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Physiologic data were completed in 37% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of those undergoing physiologic follow-up studies, 17% had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and 80% had endoscopically identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and pathologic esophageal acid exposure on pH testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite this, 65% of the patients with objectively identified abnormalities reported significant symptomatic improvement compared to their preoperative symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed changes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> that were not present preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Distal esophageal injury can persist after EGF with Collis gastroplasty, despite significant symptomatic improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Appropriate follow-up in these patients requires objective surveillance, which should eventuate in further treatment if esophageal acid is not completely controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although the Collis gastroplasty is conceptually appealing, these results call into question the liberal application of this technique during EGF </plain></SENT>
