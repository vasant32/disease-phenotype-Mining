<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined oesophagus</z:e> seems to have increased steadily in the past three decades in Europe and North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the vast majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined oesophagus</z:e> will not progress to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, it is nevertheless important to identify the risk factors associated with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates whether there has been a change, at diagnosis, in age of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined oesophagus</z:e> patients between 1990 and 2005, or an increase in the number of patients aged less than 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on age of diagnosis were abstracted from medical records of 7220 patients from 19 centres registered with UK National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e> Registry, between the years 1990 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis was carried out to assess any trends in the mean age of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall there was a mean decrease in age at diagnosis for each 1-year increase in time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This equated to a mean decrease of 3 years over the study period, 1990-2005 with the greatest difference being seen in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>About 18% of patients in the study were aged less than 50 years at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With this group also, the trend was similar, with an increase in the number of patients aged less than 50 years, at the time of diagnosis, with increasing years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mean age of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined oesophagus</z:e> has decreased between the years 1990 and 2005 in both men and women, more so in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is also reflected in an increase in newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined oesophagus</z:e> patients below the age of 50 years </plain></SENT>
