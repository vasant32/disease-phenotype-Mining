<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent developments may alter the approach to patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>)-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A newly proposed Montreal consensus definition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of esophageal columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, with or without intestinal-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is also increasing recognition of eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EE) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of these developments on a multiphysician general gastroenterology practice in a tertiary care medical centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical charts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients having an initial gastroscopy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-like symptoms over a one-year period were reviewed retrospectively, and audits of their endoscopic images and esophageal biopsies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 353 study participants, typical symptoms of heartburn and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> were present in 87.7% and 23.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Less commonly, patients presented with atypical symptoms (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in 9.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At endoscopy, 26% were found to have erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and 12% had endoscopically suspected esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluation was available for 65 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 65 biopsied patients (15%) met traditional criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (ie, exhibiting intestinal-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>), whereas 49 (75%) fulfilled the newly proposed consensus definition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients (7.7%) met the study criteria for EE (more than 20 eosinophils per high-power field), four of whom had not been previously recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-like symptoms, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may increase markedly if the Montreal definition is adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, growing awareness of EE may lead to an increase in the prevalence of this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies of the management implications of these findings are warranted </plain></SENT>
