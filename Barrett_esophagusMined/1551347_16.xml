<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean extension of Barrett's epithelium was 6.9 cm (range 2-17 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean basal acid output for the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was 8.0 +/- 5.2 meq/hr, which was significantly different compared to a group of 65 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects with mean basal acid output of 3.0 +/- 2.7 meq/hr (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between basal acid output and daily <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> dose required for therapy (r = 0.52, P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 42 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (36%) had gastric acid hypersecretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between gastric acid hypersecretion defined as a basal acid output of greater than 10.0 meq/hr and a requirement for increased daily <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> doses (greater than 300 mg/day) (P less than 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
