<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we discovered PKP1 as a novel methylated gene in EAC and then investigated the role of loss of PKP1, a constituent of the desmosome complex found in stratified epithelial layers, on the behavior of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using primary esophageal tissue samples we determined that PKP1 was rarely methylated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus (5/55; 9.1%) and BE (5/39; 12.8%) and more frequently methylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or EAC (20/60; 33.3%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PKP1 levels were decreased in BE and HGD/EAC cases compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of PKP1 in the BE cell lines CP-A and CP-D (both normally express PKP1) resulted in increased cell motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, PKP1 loss secondary to promoter methylation, as well as other mechanisms, may promote the progression of BE to EAC in a subset of patients via decreased desmosome assembly and increased cell motility </plain></SENT>
