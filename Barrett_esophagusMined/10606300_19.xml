<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The optimal management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about current practice patterns or associated direct medical costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a national cross-sectional survey, we asked a random sample of gastroenterologists how they would manage patients with BE and various degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with so-called "frequent" (at least every 12 months) surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated direct medical costs using Medicare payments and population-based estimates of the number of BE patients under surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 50% of 555 gastroenterologists responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 96% of respondents recommended endoscopic surveillance for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 30% would perform frequent surveillance; this was the case particularly gastroenterologists older than age 45 yr (odds ratio = 1.91, p = 0.038) or those receiving primarily fee-for-service reimbursement (odds ratio = 2.57, p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For BE with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the frequency of endoscopy was highly variable (range, 1-24 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For BE with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 73% of gastroenterologists recommended esophagectomy and the remainder recommended endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Approximately 95% of the gastroenterologists who recommended surveillance for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, however, were not in agreement with recommended protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We estimated the national annual expenditure for surveillance endoscopy every 24 months for BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to be at least $22 million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increase in surveillance intensity from low frequency (every 36 months) to high frequency (every 12 months) strategies would escalate costs by $29 million annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Physician age and reimbursement influence BE surveillance practice, suggesting the influence of nonclinical factors on clinical decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The majority of clinicians who would recommend surveillance for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> may not be using an appropriately aggressive strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Variations in surveillance strategies can have large cost implications </plain></SENT>
