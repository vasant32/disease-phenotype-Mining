<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> are steps in the progression of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While surgery is recommended for resectable invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, a number of treatment modalities are advocated for HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to determine the outcomes after surgery for HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified cases of HGD based on endoscopic biopsy in a single institution's databases from 1980 through 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Records were reviewed for patient characteristics, treatments, staging, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a 22-year period, 869 cases of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 1,614 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 115 had HGD without pretreatment evidence of invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients with HGD underwent resection (mean age, 59 years) as initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven had endoscopic treatment (mean age, 70 years) by photodynamic therapy or endoscopic mucosal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of the endoscopically treated patients failed, with three undergoing surgery and four observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients were initially observed, with six eventually having surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the 49 initially treated surgically, one (2%) operative mortality occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was present in 18 (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The five-year survival was 83% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resected HGD patients (91% for those without invasion, 68% with invasion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three of the eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in those with invasion were from recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection of esophageal HGD can be performed with low mortality and allows long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A significant percentage with an initial diagnosis of HGD will have invasive disease at resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Surgery is the optimal treatment for HGD unless contraindicated by severe comorbidities </plain></SENT>
