<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We investigated the prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the p16 gene (C540G) and the cyclin D1 gene (G870A), both known to regulate function in G1 arrest and therefore, may play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using PCR based restriction fragment length polymorphism and single strand conformational polymorphism, we determined single nucleotide exchanges in the p16 and cyclin D1 genes among 56 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 95 cardiac gastric <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, and in 191 distal gastric <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The allelic frequencies were compared to a control group of 253 healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The C/G genotype of p16 was identified in 10.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo>, 13.3% of cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, and in 14.1% of gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, compared to 17.4% in the healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other cases showed the C/C <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp>, as no homozygous G/G nucleotide exchange was detected in the group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients or in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, cyclin D1 G/G genotype was found 28.6%, A/G in 46.4%, and A/A in 25.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, frequency of cyclin D1 genotype was 27.4% for G/G, 57.9% for A/G, and 14.7% for AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In distal gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, both homozygous genotypes (G/G and A/A) had a frequency of 15.2% each, while the heterozygous A/G genotype occurred in 69.6% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The control group displayed 24.9% G/G, 53.8% A/G, and 21.3% A/A genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that frequencies of p16 or cyclin D1 polymorphisms in gastric and esophageal <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> do not differ significantly from the healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these polymorphisms are unlikely to be associated with risk of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> of the upper gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
