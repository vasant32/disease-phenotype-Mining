<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) and its precursor condition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, has risen rapidly in the United States for reasons that are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated the association between use of supplemental vitamins and minerals and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Seattle <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> Program is a prospective study based on 339 men and women with histologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent baseline and periodic follow-up exams, which included endoscopy and self-administered questionnaires on diet, supplement use, and lifestyle characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of multivitamins and 4 individual supplements was calculated using time-weighted averages of reported use over the observational period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional-hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for each endpoint: EA, tetraploidy, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 5 yr, there were 37 cases of EA, 42 cases of tetraploidy, and 34 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After controlling for multiple covariates including diet, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> use, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and smoking, participants who took 1 or more multivitamin pills/day had a significantly decreased risk of tetraploidy [HR = 0.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.08-0.47) and EA (HR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.15-0.99] compared to those not taking multivitamins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant inverse associations were also observed between risk of EA and supplemental <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (&gt; or = 250 mg vs. none: HR = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.11-0.58) and vitamin E (&gt; or = 180 mg vs. none: HR = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.10-0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this cohort study, use of multivitamins and single <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> supplements was associated with a significantly reduced risk of EA and markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> among individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
