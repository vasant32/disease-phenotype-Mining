<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the relative sensitivity and specificity of conventional cytology, DNA ploidy analysis with digital image analysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DIA</z:e>), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in endoscopic brushing specimens from 92 patients undergoing endoscopic surveillance for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FISH used probes to 8q24 (C-MYC), 9p21 (P16), 17q12 (HER2), and 20q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four-quadrant biopsies taken every centimeter throughout visible Barrett's mucosa were used as the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of cytology, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DIA</z:e>, and FISH for low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 5%, 5%, and 50%, respectively; for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), 32%, 45%, and 82%, respectively; and for EA, 45%, 45%, and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH was more sensitive (P &lt; .05) than cytology and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DIA</z:e> for low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, HGD, and EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specificity of cytology, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DIA</z:e>, and FISH among patients (n = 14) with tissue showing only benign squamous mucosa was 93%, 86%, and 100% (P = .22), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a polysomic FISH result had HGD and/or EA within 6 months (n = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between FISH categories (negative, 9p21 loss, gain of a single locus, and polysomy) for progression to HGD/EA (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that FISH has high sensitivity for the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EA in BE patients, with the power to stratify patients by FISH abnormality for progression to HGD/EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed to further evaluate the clinical use of FISH </plain></SENT>
