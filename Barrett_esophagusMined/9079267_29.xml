<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty patients who had been referred for investigations of heartburn (75 males, 65 females, mean age 48 years) answered an Illness Behavior Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent pH monitoring tests, and endoscopy results were obtained for 119 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was objective evidence of reflux disease on endoscopy or pH monitoring in 105 patients and no objective evidence of reflux in 35 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients were endoscopy-'positive' while 53 patients were endoscopy-'negative' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Illness Behavior Questionnaires for the four groups were analysed for seven scales of illness behavior and these were compared with reference populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with heartburn but no objective reflux were similar to those with heartburn and objective reflux on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> scales of the Illness Behavior Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reflux group without endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> also responded to their symptoms in the same way as those with endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that a patient's perception of symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> is probably not related to the degree of esophageal mucosal damage </plain></SENT>
