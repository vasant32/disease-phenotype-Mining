<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic diagnosis of short segments of Barrett's epithelium (SSBE)' is difficult and its meaning in terms of the presence of specialised columnar epithelium (SCE) has not been prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the prevalence of SCE in patients with an endoscopic diagnosis of SSBE and in individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing oesophagogastric junctions, and to compare the clinical characteristics of these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Thirty one patients with an endoscopic diagnosis of short <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, less than 3 cm in length (group A), and 44 consecutive patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing oesophagogastric junctions (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multiple biopsies were performed in suspicious epithelium and at the oesophagogastric junction in groups A and B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age and sex distribution were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reflux symptoms were more frequent in group A (p &lt; 0.001), as were endoscopic and histological signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SCE was found in 61.3% of group A patients compared with 25% in group B (p &lt; 0.002), with men predominating in group A while women were more frequent in group B (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences in reflux symptoms and endoscopic/histological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> remained significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that endoscopic diagnosis of SSBE is associated with a high prevalence of SCE, significantly higher than that found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing oesophagogastric junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences between patients with SCE in the two groups suggest they may represent two different entities </plain></SENT>
