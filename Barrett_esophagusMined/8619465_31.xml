<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented a significantly better we <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> for gastric bypass (GBP) than for vertical banded gastroplasty (VGB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional problems associated with VBG include intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> or gastroesophageal (GE) reflux, intragastric migration of the <z:chebi fb="80" ids="53550">polypropylene</z:chebi> band, staple line disruption, or inadequate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> due to excessive ingestion of high-calorie liquid or soft carbohydrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients underwent conversion from VBG to GBP for either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> failure (15) or complications of VBG (43), including 2 who where referred with anastomotic leaks and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo>, 3 with band <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath>, 15 with staple line disruption, and 23 with stomal stenosis, of whom 6 had severe GE reflux, with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percentage of excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in the 53 patients followed up for at least 1 year after conversion increased from 36% +/- 24% to 67% +/- 18%, and in the 15 "sweets eaters" from 20% +/- 19% to 70% +/- 19% (both P &lt;0.001), was equal to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> after primary GBP, and was reasonably constant over 8 years in those patients who could be contacted for follow-up, although average follow-up after 5 years was only 45% <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had resolution of GE reflux symptoms immediately after surgery and for at least 1 year or at last contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications of conversion included 2 anastomotic leaks with major wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (1 in a referred patient requiring emergency subtotal gastrectomy following a VBG leak), 3 staple line disruptions (2 subclinical), 3 small-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstructions</z:e>, and 20 <z:mp ids='MP_0003301'>marginal ulcers</z:mp> or stomal stenoses (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responded to endoscopic balloon dilation or acid reduction therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi>, calcium, and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> levels remained within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels with prophylactic supplementation in patients who returned for follow-up evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data support the efficacy of conversion to GBP in morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with a failed or complicated VBG </plain></SENT>
