<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IGF-I and its main binding protein, IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), and their polymorphisms have been investigated in relation to risk of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, but not esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data and specimens from a longitudinal study of persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n=344; median, 5.4 years follow up) to determine whether baseline serum concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and associated polymorphisms were related to the risk of developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or flow cytometric abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, circulating concentrations of IGF-I and IGBP-3 were not associated with risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or flow cytometric abnormalities, with the exception of an approximate tripling of risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> among participants with higher IGFBP-3 levels [above median; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) comparing subjects with levels lower than median versus higher of equal to median, 2.7; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.2-6.0; P=0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotypic analyses revealed that persons with the IGF-I [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> (CA)](19) or the IGFBP-3 A-202C C allele were associated with lower circulating concentrations of IGF-I (P(trend)=0.01) and IGFBP-3 (P(trend)=0.002), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Persons with two copies of the IGF-I receptors 2-bp deletion allele had a nonsignificant 2-fold increased risk of tetraploidy (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.9-5.9; P(trend)=0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for IGFBP-3 levels, participants carrying two IGFBP-3 C alleles had a significantly higher risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.0-14.0; P(trend)=0.04) than carriers of A alleles; whereas no associations were observed between the outcomes studied and the IGF-I receptors AGG trinucleotide repeat polymorphism at position 97 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings, although based on a relatively small number of outcomes and subject to several limitations, indicate a potential role of the complex IGF system in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> among persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
