<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Samples were obtained from patients with underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, two diseases associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and increased rates of colonic or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was amplified using primers bounding this exon in the polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction products were analyzed by direct dideoxy sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three point mutations in codon 13 of c-Ki-ras were found, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in colonic specimens (two high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> and one <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No point mutations were observed in the second exon of c-Ki-ras or in and around codons 12, 13, and 61 of c-N-ras and C-Ha-ras in a partial sampling of the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that ras family protooncogene activation is an uncommon event at this level of malignant progression in these <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
