<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: In recent years, changes in the definition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have resulted in some difficulties in its diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very few epidemiological data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in Turkey are available in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in a tertiary referral center in Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 18,766 endoscopic examinations done in Ege University between October 1996 and June 2001 were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histologic identification of goblet cells confirming the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> within the esophagus was considered as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 280/18,766 (1.5%) cases were suspected as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> by endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>84/18,766 (0.4%) cases were confirmed pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six cases were women and 48 men; mean age was 55.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pathology did not confirm the diagnosis in 46% of the long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and in 72% of the short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cases (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 12.8% of overall patients by endoscopy and was significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (27%, p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was found in 5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cases and in 11.2% of the endoscopically suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cases (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> are much lower than in developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the endoscopic examination, overdiagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is still a problem, especially in the presence of short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> did not affect the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
