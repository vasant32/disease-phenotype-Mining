<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The mechanism of transformation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> has not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> activate the Cdx2 promoter via nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and stimulate production of Cdx2 protein in oesophageal keratinocytes with a resulting production of intestinal type mucin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to Cdx2, Cdx1 may play an important role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the direct effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> on the expression of Cdx1 as well as the precise mechanisms of Cdx1 expression in cultured oesophageal squamous epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between Cdx1 and Cdx2 expression in cultured oesophageal squamous epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was produced by anastomosing the oesophagus and jejunum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of Cdx1 was investigated by immunohistochemistry, while the response of that expression to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> was studied using a Cdx1 promoter luciferase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, oesophageal squamous epithelial cells were transfected with a Cdx1 or Cdx2 expression vector, after which their possible transformation to intestinal-type epithelial cells was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our Barrett's rat model, the metaplastic epithelium and adjoining squamous epithelium strongly expressed Cdx1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> mixture dose-dependently increased Cdx1 promoter activity and Cdx1 protein in oesophageal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transfection of the Cdx1 expression vector in cultured oesophageal epithelial cells induced production of Cdx2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">Bile acid</z:chebi>-induced sequential expression of Cdx1 followed by Cdx2 may have an important role in the development of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
