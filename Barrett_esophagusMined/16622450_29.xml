<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated the potential of Raman spectroscopy, an optical diagnostic technique, for the identification and classification of malignant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is no clear recognition of the biochemical changes that distinguish between the different stages of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to understand these changes through Raman mapping studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raman spectral mapping was used to analyse 20-microm sections of tissue from 29 snap-frozen oesophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contiguous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin sections were reviewed by a consultant pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis was used to identify the major differences between the spectra across each map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pseudocolour score maps were generated and the peaks of corresponding loads identified enabling visualisation of the biochemical changes associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes were noted in the distribution of DNA, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean spectra obtained from selected regions demonstrate increased levels of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> in the squamous area compared with increased DNA levels in the abnormal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Raman spectroscopy is a highly sensitive and specific technique for demonstration of biochemical changes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is potential for in vivo application for real-time endoscopic optical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
