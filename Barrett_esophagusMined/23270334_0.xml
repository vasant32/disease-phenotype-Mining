<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent advances in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) have placed greater emphasis on accurate diagnosis of BE as well as better prediction of risk for progression to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluation of BE is particularly challenging with significant inter-observer variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored the presence and extent of genomic instability in BE biopsy specimens as a means to add supplementary information to the histological classification and clinical decision-making related to early disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed histology slides from 271 patients known to have BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using histological features as a guide, we microdissected target cell populations with various histological classifications of BE (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, "indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>", low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, or high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from microdissected targets and analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using a panel of 16 LOH mutational markers associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes at chromosomal loci 1p, 3p, 5q, 9p, 10q, 17p, 17q, 18q, 21q, 22q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of mutations and the clonality of each mutation were determined for each marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence and clonal expansion of LOH mutations was formulated into mutational load (ML) for each microdissected target analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ML correlated with the histological classification of microdissected targets, with increasingly severe histology having higher ML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three levels of mutation load (no ML, low ML, and high ML) were defined based on the population of microdissected targets histologically classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> microdissected targets with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had mutations, with a high ML consistently present in high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microdissected targets histologically classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or "indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>" spanned a range of no, low, and high ML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study reinforce the association of genomic instability with disease progression in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence and extent (clonality) of genomic instability, as assessed by mutational load, may assist histology in defining early stages of BE that are potentially at greater risk for disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Assessment of mutational load using our panel of LOH mutational markers may be a useful adjunct to microscopic inspection of biopsy specimens, and thereby, improve patient management </plain></SENT>
