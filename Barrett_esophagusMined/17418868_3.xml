<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The adenoviruses can be categorized in different serotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to investigate the transduction efficacy of different adenoviral serotypes in different models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chimeras of the adenoviral serotype 5 backbone and fibers of serotypes 5, 16, 35, 40, and 50 were constructed with PCR technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, cell lines were used originating from with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differentiating Caco-2 cells were used as an in vitro model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GFP was used as a reporter gene and transduction efficacy was assessed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall transduction was rather efficient in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Especially serotype 16 and 50 exhibited an improved transduction compared with the other serotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the Caco-2 cell lines, we observed a decreased transduction upon differentiation of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> serotypes had a very limited transduction and no serotype had an additional value in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Some serotypes could have an additional value in the development of gene therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Especially serotype 16 and 50 exhibited an improved transduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> cells compared with the native serotype 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, none of the serotypes had an improved potency as in differentiated intestinal cells <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> serotypes had a very limited transduction </plain></SENT>
