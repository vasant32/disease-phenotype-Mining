<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Specialized columnar epithelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a precursor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> selectively stains this type of epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present prospective study examined the detection of short-segment and long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> using <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy-directed biopsies, in comparison with biopsies directed using conventional endoscopic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Biopsies were obtained from macroscopically conspicous areas in the distal esophagus observed during conventional endoscopy in a total of 975 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately after conventional biopsies, the distal esophagus was sprayed with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> and directed biopsies were then obtained from the stained regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a histologically established <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> underwent a second upper gastrointestinal endoscopy within 1 year in order to assess the reproducibility of the method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a total of 3,900 conventional biopsy specimens (without staining), 54 specimens (1.4%) were found to show <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and were confined to 16 of the 975 patients (1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the total 130 directed biopsy specimens obtained during chromoendoscopy, 114 (87.7%) revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.00001) and were confined to 35 of the 975 patients (3.5%; P &lt; or = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings were confirmed within 1 year in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dye-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Chromoendoscopy with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> appears to be an accurate, simple, safe, inexpensive, and reproducible method of detecting specialized columnar epithelium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
