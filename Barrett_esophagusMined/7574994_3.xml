<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1990 through 1993, 27 consecutive patients (16 men, 11 women) underwent an uncut Collis-Nissen gastroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 59 years (range, 30 to 75 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a previous failed antireflux procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications for operation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> resistant to medical treatment in 18 patients and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and 4 had a peptic stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete esophageal function testing including <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> swallow, endoscopy, manometry, and 24-hour pH recording was performed in 26 of 27 patients preoperatively and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients (19%) had complications, which included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100750'>atelectasis</z:hpo> in 2, cardiac dysrhythmia in 2, and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was complete in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and ranged from 8 to 45 months (mean, 22 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subjectively, symptoms of reflux were resolved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients complain of slow esophageal emptying and 3 have occasional episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None required postoperative dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>Ulcers</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> healed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 26 patients who underwent endoscopy but recurred in 2 at 21 and 36 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mean lower esophageal sphincter gradient increased from 8.3 mm Hg preoperatively to 14.6 mm Hg (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Total percent of acid exposure decreased from 8.0% preoperatively to 1.7% (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the uncut Collis-Nissen procedure provides acceptable short-term control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
