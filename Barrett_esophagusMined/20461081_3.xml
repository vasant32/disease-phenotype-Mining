<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Image cytometric DNA analysis (ICDA) is an optical technique allowing visualisation of abnormal nuclei that may be undertaken on archival tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the accuracy of ICDA vs FC, and evaluate DNA ploidy as a prognostic biomarker after histologically successful treatment with photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nuclei were extracted from 40 mum sections of paraffin-embedded biopsies and processed for ICDA at UCL and FC at UW using standardised protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, DNA ploidy was evaluated by ICDA on a cohort of 30 patients clear of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> 1 year after aminolaevulinic acid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the comparative study, 93% (41 out of 44) of cases were classified identically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Errors occurred in the near-diploid region by ICDA and the tetraploid region by FC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cohort study, there were 13 cases of late relapse (7 cancer, 6 HGD) and 17 patients who remained free of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> after a mean follow-up of 44 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>Aneuploidy</z:mp> post-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was highly predictive for recurrent HGD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with a hazard ratio of 8.2 (1.8-37.8) (log-rank P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ICDA is accurate for the detection of DNA ploidy abnormalities when compared with FC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After histologically successful <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, patients with residual <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> are significantly more likely to develop HGD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> than those who become diploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DNA ploidy by ICDA is a valuable prognostic biomarker after ablative therapy </plain></SENT>
