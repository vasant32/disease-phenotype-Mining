<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the first genome-wide association study on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, comprising 1,852 UK cases and 5,172 UK controls in the discovery stage and 5,986 cases and 12,825 controls in the replication stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variants at two loci were associated with disease risk: chromosome 6p21, rs9257809 (Pcombined=4.09×10(-9); odds ratio (OR)=1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.13-1.28), within the major histocompatibility complex locus, and chromosome 16q24, rs9936833 (Pcombined=2.74×10(-10); OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.10-1.19), for which the closest protein-coding gene is FOXF1, which is implicated in esophageal development and structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found evidence that many common variants of small effect contribute to genetic susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and that SNP alleles predisposing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> also increase risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
