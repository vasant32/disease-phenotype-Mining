<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is considered common in the elderly and may present with various symptoms, such as heartburn, regurgitation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the patterns of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and the spectrum of disease activity in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied 476 predominantly male veterans who were referred for upper endoscopy because of symptoms or signs suggestive of upper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were interviewed immediately before the procedure by a physician who used a standardized symptom questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings were categorized and graded according to their extent and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence, nature, and severity of esophageal symptoms and their relationship to endoscopic disease severity were then analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made between two age groups, the young (age less than 65 yr old, mean age 55 yr, age range 30-65 yr), and the elderly (more than 66 yr old, mean age 72 yr, age range 66-90 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Heartburn without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was noted in 28% of young and 24% of elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was noted in 15 % of young and 18% of the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of various stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> was similar in the two groups (p &gt; 0.1, chi2 test; odds ratio: 0.983; 95% CI: 0.651-1.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Quantitative esophageal symptom analysis revealed remarkably similar symptom severity scores for both groups for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> stages I-IV, as well as for symptomatic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were significantly less symptomatic than the young (symptom index 2.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 4.88 +/- 1.01, p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among symptomatic adults undergoing upper endoscopy, the elderly appear to have prevalence rates, patterns, and features of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> that are generally similar to those of their younger counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the severity of symptoms in the subgroup of elderly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is significantly less than in the young and may contribute to poor or delayed recognition of disease </plain></SENT>
