<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to perform an economic analysis evaluating the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic ablation of nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Markov model evaluated three competing strategies in a hypothetical 50-year-old cohort with nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> from a societal perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strategy I -- natural history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's disease</z:e> (without surveillance); Strategy II -- surveillance performed according to the American College of Gastroenterology practice guidelines; Strategy III -- endoscopic ablative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The model was biased against ablative therapy with a conservative estimate of complete response and continued standard surveillance even after complete ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> potential complications were accounted for, and an incomplete histological response after ablation was presumed to have the same risk of progression as untreated Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transitional probabilities, discounted cost, and utility values to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were obtained from published information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Direct costs were used in our analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In baseline analysis, the ablative strategy yielded the highest QALY and was more cost-effective than endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a Monte Carlo analysis, the relative risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the strategy based on endoscopic ablation was decreased compared with the other strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In threshold analysis, the critical determinants of cost-effectiveness of the ablative strategy were rate of complete response to ablation, total cost of ablation, and risk of progression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of the model, ablation for nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is more cost-effective than endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials of ablative therapy in nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are needed to establish its effectiveness in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
