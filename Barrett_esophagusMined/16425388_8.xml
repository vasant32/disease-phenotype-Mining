<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the risk factors for the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in these patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data collected retrospectively on 597 consecutive patients diagnosed at endoscopy and histology to have CLE at Leeds General Infirmary between 1984 and 1995 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors evaluated included age, sex, length of columnar segment, smoking, and drinking habits, history of non-steroidal ingestion, presence of endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, ulceration or benign strictures and presence of Helicobacter pylori in esophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four patients presented or developed esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients with CLE were males (OR 5.12, 95%CI 2.04-12.84, P=0.0005), and benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> (OR 4.37, 95%CI 2.02-9.45, P=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male subjects and patients who developed benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> constituted 86% (n=38) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who presented or developed esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was associated with a significant reduction in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> (OR 0.28, 95%CI 0.13-0.57, P=0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other clinical characteristics differentiate between the non-malignant and malignant group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with CLE, endoscopic surveillance for the early detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> may be restricted to male subjects, as well as patients who develop benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
