<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The open Nissen fundoplication is effective therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the outcomes in 198 patients treated with the laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was evaluated for up to 32 months after surgery to ascertain whether similar positive results could be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: To ensure surgical success, patients were required to have mechanically defective sphincters on manometry and increased esophageal acid exposure on 24-hour pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients either had severe complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> or had failed medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These requirements have been found to be necessary to ensure a successful surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The disease was complicated by ulceration (46), stricture (25) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent standard Nissen fundoplications identical in every detail to open procedures except that the procedures were carried out by the laparoscopic route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perioperative complications included gastric or esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> (2), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (2), breakdown of crural repair (2) and periesophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The only mortality occurred from a duodenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients required conversion to the open procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median hospital stay was 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One hundred patients were observed for follow-up for 6 to 32 months (median 12 months), with outcomes similar to the open Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further surgery was required for two patients who had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and one who developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven percent are satisfied with their decision to have the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication can be carried out safely and effectively with similar positive results to the open procedure and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the advantages of the minimally invasive approach </plain></SENT>
