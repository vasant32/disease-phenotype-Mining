<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Associations between the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and meat consumption, intake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35807">N-nitrosodimethylamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron were examined in the Netherlands Cohort Study among 120,852 subjects aged 55 to 69 years in 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exposure was measured on the basis of a 150-item food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 16.3 years of follow-up, 447 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cases with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and 3,919 subcohort members were analyzed in a case-cohort design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no association of any of the examined exposures with Barrett's risk in men or women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were similar in age-adjusted and fully adjusted models and in models excluding the first two years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support a role of meat consumption and N-nitrosation related factors in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: The possible causal association between red meat intake and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is unlikely to be mediated by mechanisms through the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
