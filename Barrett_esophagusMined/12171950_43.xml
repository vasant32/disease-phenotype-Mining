<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Barrett's oesophageal epithelium (BE) is clinically important due to the associated inflammatory and malignant complications which are unevenly distributed throughout the BE segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the immunoregulatory environment may influence disease manifestations, we analysed the inflammatory and cytokine responses throughout the BE mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then investigated whether the inflammatory gradient is related to the distribution of metaplastic cell subtypes, epithelial exposure to the components of refluxate, or squamocolumnar cell interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients with long segment BE were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The segmental degree of endoscopic and histopathological <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was graded, and expression of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-8, IL-4, and IL-10 were determined by ELISA following organ culture with or without addition of acid or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mucin staining and IL-10 immunohistochemistry were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of squamocolumnar interactions on cytokine expression were analysed using cocultures of squamous (OE-21) and BE (TE7) <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a histopathological inflammatory gradient in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> was maximal at the new squamocolumnar junction with &gt; or = 2-fold increase in proinflammatory IL-8 and IL-1 beta expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proximal proinflammatory response could not be explained by the distribution of metaplastic subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pulsatile exposure of BE to acid and bile, as well as juxtaposition of BE to squamous epithelial cells in culture, increased expression of IL-1 beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was minimal distally with a significant increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 expression and 4/6 cancers occurred distally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Specific cytokine responses may contribute to the localisation of inflammatory and malignant complications within BE </plain></SENT>
