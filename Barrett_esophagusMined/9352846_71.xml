<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to look for evidence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001472'>familial predisposition</z:hpo> to reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Index patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 27), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 40), and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n = 55) were recruited from tertiary care and community populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parents and siblings of patients (n = 243) and their spouses' relatives (n = 230) completed reflux symptom questionnaires (response rate, 86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reflux symptoms were significantly more prevalent among parents and siblings of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (43% vs. 23%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (46% vs. 27%) than spouse control relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found for the reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> group (33% vs. 29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reflux was more prevalent in siblings than spouses of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (41% vs. 12%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (40% vs. 6%), a difference that was not found with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (24% vs. 32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reflux was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, 41% vs. 28% in the nonobese; smoking, 45% vs. 31% in nonsmokers; and men, 39% vs. 27% in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There may be a genetic predisposition to the development of reflux in families of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For uncomplicated reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, environmental factors appear more important </plain></SENT>
