<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> might prevent this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Web of Science through August 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies were included if they evaluated exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, reported the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, and reported relative risks or odds ratios (OR), or provided data for their estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Summary OR estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis included 13 studies (including a post hoc analysis of 22 randomized controlled trials) reporting 9285 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> among 1,132,969 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A meta-analysis of the studies showed a significant (28%) reduction in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> among patients who took <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> (adjusted OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.86), although there was considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In analyzing a subset of patients known to have BE (5 studies, 312 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> [EAC] developed in 2125 patients), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were associated with a significant (41%) decrease in the risk of EAC, after adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.45-0.78) with consistent results among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number needed to treat with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> to prevent 1 case of EAC in patients with BE was 389 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on meta-analysis of observational studies, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use may be associated with lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, particularly risk of EAC in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
