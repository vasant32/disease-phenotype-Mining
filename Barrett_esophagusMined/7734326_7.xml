<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of one or more markers was seen in 72% (13 of 18) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> on 17p and 56% (10 of 18) on 17q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The highest 17p losses were found at D17S799 (62%, five of eight) and D17S261 (55%, five of nine), while loss at the p53 locus was 31% (5 of 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The highest loss on 17q was found at the TCF-2 (17q11.2-q12) locus with 66% (8 of 12) LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCF-2 was the only marker lost in two of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> samples; furthermore, TCF-2 was lost in four other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> which retained heterozygosity at the markers on either side of it, D17S261 and D17S740 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six markers were used to assess LOH at 17q11.2-q12, and five of eight of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> specimens which had LOH at TCF-2 had no other loss on 17q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant correlations were found between loss on 17q or 17p and any clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose from these data that the 17q11.2-q12 region contains a novel predisposing gene in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and may represent the site of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
