<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to report the combined results of two published and two ongoing studies on radiofrequency ablation of BE with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, as presented at SSAT presidential plenary session DDW 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enrolled patients had BE &lt; or = 12 cm with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visible lesions were endoscopically resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A balloon-based catheter was used for circumferential ablation and an endoscope-based catheter for focal ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ablation was repeated every 2 months until the entire <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1258085" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barrett epithelium</z:e> was endoscopically and histologically eradicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included (35 men, median age 68 years, median BE 7 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients first underwent endoscopic resection [early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (n = 16), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 12), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 3)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Worst histology remaining after resection was high-grade (n = 32), low-grade (n = 10), or no (n = 2) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After ablation, complete histological eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was achieved in 43 patients (98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications following ablation were mucosal laceration at resection site (n = 3) and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 21 months of follow-up (interquartile range 10-27), no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation, with or without prior endoscopic resection for visible abnormalities, is effective and safe in eradicating BE and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
