<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The importance of alterations of the Her-2/neu oncogene in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BCA) is discussed controversially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated for the first time the Her-2/neu status in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence of BCA simultaneously at the DNA, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and protein level using resection specimens of 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The locus-specific Her-2/neu gene status was quantified by performing fluorescence in situ hybridization, and information about the ploidy status of chromosome 17 was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections from the same areas were used for quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan RT-PCR) of laser-microdissected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and for immunohistochemistry to quantify Her-2/neu <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and oncoprotein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her-2/neu gene amplification was observed in 35% of BCA, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these samples showed strong overexpression of both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and oncoprotein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A polysomy 17 without Her-2/neu gene amplification was observed in 52% of BCA, showing a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or moderately elevated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and no or weak immunopositivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From 13 areas of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) we found four to be amplified for the Her-2/neu locus, whereas five showed a polysomy 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four samples of HGD areas with Her-2/neu gene amplification displayed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and strong oncoprotein overexpression; however, lower <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were seen than in the amplified BCA areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the samples with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) showed a locus-specific Her-2/neu amplification, but polysomy 17 was present in four of eight cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No changes were detected in BCA-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, only a locus-specific Her-2/neu gene amplification was associated with strong <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression and strong membranous Her-2/neu immunostaining in BCA and HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A chromosome 17 polysomy, as found in the majority of BCA, led to no or weak <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression and no or weak immunopositivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence, a chromosome 17 polysomy without Her-2/neu gene amplification was already present in LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may be a result of an early polyploidization, preceding the later genetic events, such as Her-2/neu gene amplification in HGD and BCA </plain></SENT>
