<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The eradication of early stage neoplastic lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is imperative to prevent invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early stage lesions have an extremely low risk of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, thereby, making local treatment feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy destroys malignant cells by a photochemical effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of photodynamic therapy with green light and a new photosensitizer, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9437">temoporfin</z:chebi> or m-tetrahydroxyphenyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36303">chlorin</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and early stage neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four days after injection of m-tetrahydroxyphenyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36303">chlorin</z:chebi>, lesions were illuminated at a wavelength of 514 nm through non-circumferential windowed diffusers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up endoscopy with biopsies was performed at regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen lesions (7 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 7 intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) in 12 patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions, efficacy was 100% and squamous re-epithelialization was complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Side effects were of moderate severity (one stricture) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 34 (15) months (range 12-68 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Green light photodynamic therapy with m-tetrahydroxyphenyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36303">chlorin</z:chebi> can eradicate early stage neoplastic lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and may be proposed as an alternative first-line therapy or a second-line therapy after failure of other endoscopic treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and patient tolerance of the procedure justify further studies of the method in larger groups of patients </plain></SENT>
