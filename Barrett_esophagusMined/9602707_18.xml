<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative pathological methods could help to achieve a more accurate and reproducible diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the immunoquantitation of p53 and Ki67 and the morphometric analysis of features associated with proliferation and differentiation were evaluated for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In slides of 35 oesophagectomy specimens, 73 areas that displayed either no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (ImCa) were initially considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Agreement on double blind examination by two experienced pathologists was reached in 58 areas, which were used as the 'learning set' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 15 areas of disagreement were used as a second set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, the most significant differences in the learning set were found for Ki67, p53, stratification index (SI), mean nuclear area, and volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further multivariate analysis showed that for discrimination between ND and LGD, the combination of Ki67 and SI resulted in 94 per cent correctly classified areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, for the discrimination between LGD and HGD, Ki67 and SI were the most powerful combination (again, 94 per cent of areas classified correctly) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The discrimination between HGD and ImCa with any combination of the quantitative parameters never exceeded 80 per cent correct classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The addition of p53 was of no value in improving the discrimination of ND vs. LGD, or of LGD vs. HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the 15 original disagreement areas of the initial set of 73, three of the five ND/LGD areas could be uniquely classified as either ND or LGD by Ki67 and SI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, three of the four LGD/HGD disagreement areas could be uniquely classified with the combination of Ki67 and SI as either LGD or HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the quantitative assessment of cytometric and morphometric features associated with proliferation and differentiation (especially Ki67 and SI) can be a valuable adjunct tool for clinical decision making in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
