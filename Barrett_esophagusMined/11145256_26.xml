<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) of the gastroesophageal junction (IMGEJ) are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, these conditions are difficult to distinguish from one another based solely on endoscopic and pathologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the immunophenotypic features of SSBE and IMGEJ and to compare the results with lesions of known etiologies: long segment BE (LSBE) caused by reflux disease and Helicobacter pylori-induced IM of the gastric antrum (IMGA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Routinely processed mucosal biopsy specimens from 11 patients with LSBE, 17 with SSBE, 10 with IMGEJ, 16 with IMGA, 17 with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nonmetaplastic GEJ, and 7 patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric antrum were immunohistochemically stained with monoclonal antibodies to: Das1, an antibody shown to react specifically with colonic goblet cells; 45M1, an antibody that recognizes the M1 gastric mucin antigen; and cytokeratin (CK) 7 and 20, antibodies that have previously been reported to show specific staining patterns in BE versus IMGA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also evaluated was nonintestinalized mucinous epithelium from LSBE, SSBE, and also the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GEJ and gastric antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LSBE, SSBE, and IMGEJ showed similar prevalences of Das1 (91% versus 88% versus 100%) and 45M1 reactivity (100% versus 100% versus 100%), and a similar pattern of CK7/20 reactivity (diffuse strong CK7 staining of the surface and crypt epithelium, and strong surface and superficial crypt CK20 staining) (91% versus 94% versus 90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, although 45M1 reactivity in IMGA (93%) was similar to that of the other three groups, IMGA showed a significantly lower prevalence of Das positivity (13%, p &lt; 0.001), and only a 14% prevalence of the CK7/20 staining pattern that was predominant in the other three groups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Das1, 45M1, and CK7/20 staining were similar in nonintestinalized "cardia-type" mucinous epithelium from LSBE, SSBE, and the GEJ, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were distinct from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, the immunophenotypic features of SSBE and IMGEJ are similar and closely resemble those seen in classic LSBE, but are distinct from IMGA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may indicate that IM in LSBE, SSBE and at the GEJ have similar biologic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on our data, SSBE and IMGEJ cannot be distinguished on the basis of their immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
