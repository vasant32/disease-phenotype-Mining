<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Differential Normalized Fluorescence (DNF) technique has been used to distinguish high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technology may assist gastroenterologists in targeting biopsies, reducing the number of biopsies using the standard protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the presence of reactive atypia/<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, it becomes difficult for the pathologist to differentiate non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before DNF technique may be used to guide target biopsies, it is critical to know whether reactive atypia/<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in non-dysplastic Barrett's may result in false positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine whether DNF technique is adversely affected by the presence of reactive atypia/<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> resulting in false positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred ten-nanometer laser light was used to induce autofluorescence of Barrett's mucosa in 49 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical study included 37 males and 12 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was a blinded retrospective data analysis study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 303 spectra were collected and matched to non-dysplastic Barrett's biopsy results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy-five spectra were collected from areas with a pathology of non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with reactive atypia/<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-eight spectra were collected from areas with non-dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without reactive changes/<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The spectra were analyzed using the DNF Index at 480 nm and classified as positive or negative using the threshold of -0.75 × 10(-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using DNF technique, 92.6% of non-dysplastic samples with reactive atypia/<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were classified correctly (162/175) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>92.2% of non-dysplastic samples without reactive atypia/<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were classified correctly (118/128) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Comparing the ratios of false positives among the two sample groups, there was not a statistically significant difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using DNF technique for classification of non-dysplastic Barrett's mucosa does not result in false-positive readings due to reactive atypia/<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Target biopsies guided by DNF technique may drastically reduce the number of pinch biopsies using the standard biopsy protocol </plain></SENT>
