<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the angiogenic profile of human oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was carried out on a large series of surgically resected Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_481'>preneoplastic lesions</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascularization was quantified by microvessel counting and measurement of the percentage microvessel surface area after immunohistochemistry using the CD34 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) was also examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were correlated with clinico-pathological data and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascularization, assessed by both microvessel counting and measurement of the microvessel surface, was statistically higher in superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> than in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher vascularization was correlated with a lower rate of lymph node and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, as well as with better survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were excluded from the study, microvessel count failed to provide any significant prognostic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of the inclusion or exclusion of superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, the expression of VEGF was correlated with a higher vascularisation but did not provide prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that high angiogenic properties are acquired in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vascularization as assessed by both microvessel counting and measurement of the microvessel surface is not informative for prognosis in infiltrative Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of VEGF is correlated with vascularization, but has no independent prognostic relevance </plain></SENT>
