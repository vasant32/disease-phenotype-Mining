<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stepwise radical endoscopic resection of the Barrett's segment with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is a promising new treatment resulting in complete re-epithelialization of the esophagus with neosquamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether radical resection also eradicates genetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate whether genetic abnormalities as found in the Barrett's segment before radical resection are effectively eradicated and absent in the neosquamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> who successfully underwent radical resection were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to assess p53 protein overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA fluorescent in-situ hybridization was (DNA-FISH) performed for evaluation of numerical abnormalities of chromosomes 1 and 9, and losses of p16 and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and DNA-FISH were performed on endoscopic resection specimens of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and on follow-up biopsies of the neosquamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DNA-FISH and IHC showed alterations in the pretreatment samples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> showed aneusomy of chromosome 1 and 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Loss of p16 and p53 were seen in 6 and 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IHC showed intense p53 nuclear staining in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment biopsies showed neosquamous epithelium with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diploid signal count for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DNA-FISH probes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IHC stainings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radical resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> successfully eradicates pre-existing genetic abnormalities and results in neosquamous epithelium without these genetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
