<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case report a rare presentation esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> due to Barrett's ulceration into an aortic vessel is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a 42 year old man with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further investigations showed an active intrathoracal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> at exactly the same site of the known Barret's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> one year before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thoracotomy with evacuation of blood was performed and an aortic branch as <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> focus was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>Hemothorax</z:hpo> due to esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of a benign Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of aortoesophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>'s can be complicated and its presentation is frequently unspecific and is simply confused with other disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> thoracotomy is necessary and choice of closure depends on the cause and size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the need for maintaining a wide-ranging view of potential casus of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The key to survival in patients with aorto-esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> is maintaining awareness of the condition to allow early diagnosis and operative management of this treatable lesion </plain></SENT>
