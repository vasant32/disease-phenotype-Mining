<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The follow-up rate was 92% (85 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> was initially good (an average reduction in BMI of 13 during the first year), but late <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> has been a common complaint and a reason for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other complications that necessitated reoperation were severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and esophagus not amenable to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients have developed signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at late follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients (50%) were reoperated 70 times for correction of the band or conversion to vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common reoperative procedure was conversion to VBG (38 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 25 (31%) of the 80 patients with long-term follow-up have an intact band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show the need of long follow-up and that this GB cannot be recommended for the treatment of morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
