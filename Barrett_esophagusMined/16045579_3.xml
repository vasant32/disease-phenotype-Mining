<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: In order to detect early changes of malignant degeneration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), and to reduce the cost of surveillance, molecular biomarkers of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> have been sought, with limited success, using genomic and immunohistochemical tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We postulate that direct analysis of epithelial proteins using mass spectrometry will provide protein profiles capable of identifying patients at high risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to find transitional protein signals that show a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> profile within histologically benign BE, which can be used as indicators of early malignant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen fresh-frozen, resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> specimens were analyzed using laser capture microdissection and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples of squamous epithelium, and both benign and malignant Barrett's epithelium, were compared for differences in protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reliable differentiation of squamous and Barrett's epithelium was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A comparison of benign and malignant Barrett's epithelium identified a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific protein peaks that were deletion or expression variations from benign epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four instances the proteins (7350, 8446, 10850, and 14693) appeared to be early malignant changes in histologically benign BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mass spectrometry performed upon fresh-frozen Barrett's epithelium, obtained by laser-capture microdissection, displays reproducible, tissue-specific, protein profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Distinct differences are demonstrated between benign and malignant epithelium, some of which appear to be candidate biomarkers of early malignant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This technique reliably displays cellular protein expression in esophageal epithelium and deserves further study as a tool to identify early malignant degeneration in BE </plain></SENT>
