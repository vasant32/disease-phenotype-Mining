<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the symptomatic response to esophageal exposure to hypertonic and acidic solutions in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Symptom intensity and character were measured in double-blind fashion during esophageal instillation of water, hypertonic saline (osmolality 1030 mOsm/kg), <z:chebi fb="63" ids="17883">hydrochloric acid</z:chebi> (pH 1 and 2.5), and acidified hypertonic saline (pH 1 and 2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The studies were performed in healthy controls and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with Barrett's differed from the non-Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients in being less sensitive to acid (mean intensity score, 2.3 vs 4.8, p &lt; 0.05), more sensitive to hypertonic saline (1.3 vs 0.4, p &lt; 0.05) and by showing an additive effect when the acid and hypertonic solutions were combined, resulting in similar scores in the two patient groups to the combination (4.4 vs 4.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> was higher in the Barrett's group compared to the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients after hypertonic saline (21% vs 0%, p &lt; 0.05), acid (50% vs 21%, p &lt; 0.05) and the acid hypertonic combination (71% vs 29%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Barrett's mucosa is associated with reduced symptomatic response to acid, increased response to hypertonic solutions, and a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> in response to either stimulus </plain></SENT>
