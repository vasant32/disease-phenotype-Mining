<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, high fat intake, and low consumption of fruits and vegetables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This trial tested whether an intervention to reduce these risk factors in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282313" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preneoplastic condition</z:e> for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, could reduce biomarkers of cellular proliferation and, by inference, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven men and women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> were randomized to an intensive dietary intervention or control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 18 and 36 months after intervention, biopsies were obtained at 2-cm intervals throughout the length of the Barrett segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ki67/DNA content flow cytometry was used to assess (a) % Ki67-positive proliferating diploid G(1) cells, (b) % total Ki67-positive proliferating cells, (c) presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, and (d) presence of &gt;6% of cells in the 4N (G(2)/tetraploid) fraction of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also assessed re-epithelialization and length of the Barrett segment, reflux symptoms, and medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intervention effects for energy, fat, fruits and vegetables, and weight were, respectively, -314 kcal, -12.2% energy, 1.8 servings/d, and -4.0 kg at 18 months (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.005) and were smaller but remained significant at 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant effects of the intervention on any biomarker of cellular proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intervention effects +/- SE for mean %G(1) Ki67+ cells were 0.98 +/- 1.58 at 18 months and 1.79 +/- 1.31 at 36 months; the relative risks (95% confidence interval) for developing &gt;6% of cells in 4N were 0.5 (0.1-2.6) at 18 months and 0.75 (0.2-3.1) at 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A single control participant developed <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant effects on re-epithelialization, segment length, or reflux medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that substantial dietary change has no short-term effects on biomarkers of cellular proliferation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> or on clinical observations of the Barrrett segment </plain></SENT>
