<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reflux occurs due to excessive and inappropriate relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An important mediator of this is nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, high concentrations of which are generated within the lumen when swallowed saliva meets gastric acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Saliva contains <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>, derived from the enterosalivary recirculation of dietary nitrate, which is reduced to nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> by gastric acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether salivary <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> contributes to dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 20 volunteers, studies of gastro-esophageal function were performed on four separate days, following consumption of a standardized meal, with saliva <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> concentrations modified differently each day by intra-oral <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The infusions produced an appropriate range in saliva <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> concentrations, from below to well above the physiological range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The standardized meal induced expected physiological changes in gastro-esophageal function confirming the recordings were sensitive and robust </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophageal acid exposure (primary outcome) was similar on each study day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes, including number and duration of reflux events, rate of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, lower esophageal sphincter pressure and rate of gastric emptying were also unaffected by variations in saliva <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">Nitrite</z:chebi> in swallowed saliva does not modify gastro-esophageal junction function or predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The wide range in saliva <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> concentrations, the sensitivity of the physiological recordings and the number of subjects studied make it very unlikely that an effect has been missed </plain></SENT>
