<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) are unusually resistant to the antisecretory effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare intragastric and intraesophageal acidity in patients with BE receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg three times daily (t.i.d.), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg twice daily (b.i.d.), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> 20 mg t.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, three-way crossover study, patients with long-segment BE received each of the three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> dosages for 5 days separated by 10-14-day washout periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intragastric and intraesophageal pHs were measured for 24 h on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 31 patients with evaluable pH data, intragastric pH was &gt;4.0 for 88.4%, 81.4%, and 80.4% of day 5 after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg t.i.d., 40 mg b.i.d., and 20 mg t.i.d., respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">Esomeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg t.i.d. was significantly more effective than the other dosages (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraesophageal pH was &lt;4.0 for mean values of &lt;5% of the monitoring period with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three dosing regimens, but esophageal pH remained &lt;4.0 for &gt;5% of the time in 16%, 23%, and 19% of patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg t.i.d., 40 mg b.i.d., and 20 mg t.i.d., respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> dosages were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> dosages significantly decreased intragastric acidity and reduced esophageal acid exposure to mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values in the total group of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, abnormal esophageal acid exposure continued in 16-23% of patients despite the significant decrease in gastric acidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the apparent "<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> resistance" described in patients with BE may be caused by their profound reflux diathesis rather than by gastric resistance to the antisecretory effects of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
