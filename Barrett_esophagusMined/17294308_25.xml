<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>-related high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> can be treated by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), but the adjacent metaplastic epithelium remains at risk for developing further lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to evaluate the results of the circumferential EMR in removing not only the neoplastic lesion but also the remaining Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-one consecutive patients (mean age: 66 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were submitted to 63 EMR sessions in one single-referral endoscopic unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was detected in 23 of these cases, most of them classified as T1N0 (20 patients) by endosonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mucosectomy after saline submucosal injection was performed for the neoplastic lesions and, if necessary, the residual Barrett's epithelium was removed by the same technique one month later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A retrospective evaluation showed that, during a mean follow-up of 31.6 months, Barrett's epithelium was completely replaced by squamous epithelium in 31 (75.6%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 10 complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were managed endoscopically: 8 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> occurred in 9 (14.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Barrett's epithelium recurred in 10 (24.4%) patients and recurrent or metachronous early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was detected in 5 (12.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of which were treated again by EMR; the fifth patient was referred to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation was used in 6 cases to treat Barrett's epithelium, and two patients received concomitant chemoradiotherapy as adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Circumferential EMR provides an effective endoscopic approach to the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>-related high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are necessary to evaluate the long-term results </plain></SENT>
