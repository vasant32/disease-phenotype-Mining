<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the efficacy and safety of extensive endomucosal resection (EMR) in eradicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) harbouring early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> have been established, factors predicting efficacy remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the complete eradication rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IMC), safety, and factors predicting complete eradication by EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with histological confirmation of Barrett's HGIN/IMC were prospectively identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EMR was performed using Duette multiband ligator or cap technique by a single operator (NEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 99 patients (81 males) with median age 67 years [interquartile range (IQR) 60-77 years] and median Barrett's length 4 cm (IQR 2-6 cm) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 628 index EMRs [mean 6.3, median 5 (IQR 3-8)], 23% showed IMC, 58.5% showed HGIN, and 16% showed low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A median of 8 EMR resections per patient (IQR 6-16, 1,064 resections in 89 patients) resulted in complete eradication of BE harboring <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in 49.4% and eradication of HGIN/IMC in 81% (BE &lt;5 cm subgroup: 65% complete eradication and 91% HGIN eradication) at median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-27 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P = 0.003) and Barrett's length &lt;5 cm (P = 0.001) were predictors of complete BE eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Barrett's length &lt;5 cm was the only significant predictor [odds ratio (OR) 3.4, standard error (SE) 0.11, P = 0.0006] on multiple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strictures developed in 27% and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in 2% with no procedure-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Extensive EMR for removal of BE with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Outcomes for complete BE eradication are modest at 49.4% and eradication of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Barrett's length &lt;5 cm is the only significant predictor of complete response </plain></SENT>
