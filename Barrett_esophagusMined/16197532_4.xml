<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper compares the Nissen and Collis-Nissen operations when treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients with documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (male : female, 26 : 7, median age, 48.8 years) had a Nissen fundoplication during 1976-1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients (male : female = 41 : 10, median age = 53.2 years) underwent a Collis-Nissen operation between 1990 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical assessments, esophagogram, radionuclide emptying, manometry, 24-h pH study, and endoscopy were obtained pre- and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 8.0 years for the Nissen group and 6.5 years for the Collis group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative reflux symptoms were more frequent in the Nissen group (52%) when compared to the Collis group (7%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These symptoms correlated with the 24-h pH recordings revealing an increased acid exposure in the Nissen group (3.4%) as opposed to 1% in the Collis group (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy revealed mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in 39% of patients receiving a standard Nissen repair while these damages were seen in 7% of patients who were offered an elongation gastroplasty with a total fundoplication (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative success rate was 83% for the Nissen group and 100% for the Collis group at 5 years, and 63% versus 90% at 10 years (Log-rank test, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Collis-Nissen fundoplication provides better reflux protection for Barrett's patients than a standard Nissen repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It lowers the risk of fundoplication failure </plain></SENT>
