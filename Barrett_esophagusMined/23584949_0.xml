<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reasons for its rapidly increasing incidence include the rising prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, combined with the decreasing prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The strong male predominance remains unexplained, but hormonal influence might play an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Future prevention might include the treatment of reflux or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or chemoprevention with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, but no evidence-based preventive measures are currently available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likely future developments include endoscopic screening of better defined high-risk groups for EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> might benefit from surveillance, at least those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, but screening and surveillance strategies need careful evaluation to be feasible and cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgery for EAC is more extensive than virtually any other standard procedure, and postoperative survival, health-related quality of life, and nutrition need to be improved (eg, by improved treatment, better decision-making, and more individually tailored follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Promising clinical developments include increased survival after preoperative chemoradiotherapy, the potentially reduced impact on health-related quality of life after minimally invasive surgery, and the new endoscopic therapies for dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> or early EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rates are improving slightly, but poor prognosis remains a challenge </plain></SENT>
