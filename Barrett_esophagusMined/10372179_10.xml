<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work is to show the possibility of differentiating these two types of epithelia in terms of their electrical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the measurements, we employed a 1.95-m-long, 3.2-mm-diameter, four-electrode probe designed to be used transendoscopically in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BE is a condition in which the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium of the intestinal type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is considered as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> that puts patients at a 30-125-fold risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis and surveillance of BE involve taking multiple biopsies, an expensive and time-consuming procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study constitutes the first stage in the replacement of tissue biopsy by "virtual biopsies" </plain></SENT>
