<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic resection (ER) is an important treatment for high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ER-cap requires submucosal lifting and positioning of a snare in the cap, making it technically demanding and laborious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiband mucosectomy (MBM) uses a modified variceal band ligator and requires no submucosal lifting or positioning of a snare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare ER-cap and MBM for piecemeal ER of early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary-care and community-care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved 84 patients (64 men; median age 70 years) undergoing piecemeal ER of Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Piecemeal ER was performed by using ER-cap (n = 42) or MBM (n = 42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Safety, efficacy, procedure time, costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedure time (34 vs 50 minutes; P = .02) and costs (€240 vs €322; P &lt; .01) were significantly less with MBM compared with ER-cap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MBM resulted in smaller resection specimens than ER-cap (18 ×13 mm vs 20 × 15 mm; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Maximum thicknesses of specimens and resected submucosa were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no clinically relevant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> occurred, 3 with ER-cap, 1 with MBM (P = not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Potential bias because of different levels of experience among participating endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Piecemeal ER with MBM is faster and cheaper than with ER-cap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Despite the lack of submucosal lifting, MBM appears not to be associated with more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although MBM results in slightly smaller specimens, the clinical relevance of this may be limited because depth of resections does not differ between both techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>MBM may thus be preferred for piecemeal ER of early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>(Clinical trial registration number: NTR1435.) </plain></SENT>
