<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that females have a poorer outcome than do males after surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate reflux and esophageal symptoms in males and females in a community sample and in patients undergoing antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Face-to-face interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A South Australian community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of 2973 individuals from the community and 2153 patients presenting for antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In a random sample of 2973 individuals from the community, the prevalence of reflux and other esophageal symptoms was determined and compared with symptoms in 2153 patients presenting for antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Identical questions were used to assess frequency and severity of heartburn and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analog scales assessed heartburn and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (0 indicating no symptoms and 10, severe symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcomes for males vs females were compared across both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the community, females were more likely to report heartburn, and when reported, symptom severity was higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was similar for males and females, although females reported higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> scores for solid foods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A similar proportion of males and females took antireflux medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Females presenting for antireflux surgery were, on average, 7 years older than males, had a higher body mass index, and had higher heartburn and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> symptom scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At endoscopy, men were more likely to have ulcerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and at surgery they were less likely to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences were noted between males and females in the frequency and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>-associated symptoms in the community and in patients presenting for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These might reflect differences in symptom perception, which explain previously reported better outcomes in men undergoing antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
