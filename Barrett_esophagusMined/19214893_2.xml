<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The CO (2) laser is a surgical tool that is widely used because of its predictable penetration depth and minimal collateral damage due to efficient absorption of CO (2) laser energy by tissue water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until recently, endoscopic use was limited by lack of an efficient, flexible delivery system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the performance, efficacy, and safety of a novel, photonic band-gap CO (2) laser configured for esophageal mucosal ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an endoscopic experimental study in a porcine survival model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial evaluation was done on ex vivo tissue followed by endoscopic studies at 7-, 10-, 15-, and 20-W power and at 0-, 1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-mm distances, using continuous and pulsed currents, to determine optimal performance settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an IACUC-approved protocol, six pigs underwent circumferential ablation of the distal 6 cm of the esophagus at 10W continuous current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were monitored for 2 or 4 weeks to evaluate delayed effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prior to euthanasia, the proximal esophagus was ablated to evaluate the homogeneity of ablation and depth of injury immediately after single and repeat ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The animals resumed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diets within 24 hours and experienced no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathology at 2 and 4 weeks revealed complete re-epithelialization with minimal histologic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A single application of the laser produced complete transepithelial ablation of a mean of 83.3 % of the surface area (range 55 % - 100 %); depth of injury was to the muscularis mucosa in five pigs and to the superficial submucosa in one pig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With ablation, sloughing, and re-ablation, a mean of 95 % transepithelial ablation was achieved (range 80 % -100 %) with similar depth of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel, flexible CO (2) laser, homogeneous ablation was achieved with predictable penetration and minimal deep tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results warrant further evaluation of the laser in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, as it may overcome the limitations of current technologies including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, stricture, and inhomogeneity </plain></SENT>
