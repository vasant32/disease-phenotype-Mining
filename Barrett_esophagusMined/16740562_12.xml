<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective audit of the effect of disseminating guidelines in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prospective audit of the effect of introducing local guidelines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> surveillance officers, 2003-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Two general hospitals in Australia, 2002-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adult patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT: Proportions of patients in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> surveillance programme who had appropriate time intervals between follow-up endoscopies and who had appropriate numbers of biopsies collected at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE: Local guidelines were laid down </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surveillance coordinators for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were introduced to manage the process according to a clinical protocol designed for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EFFECTS OF CHANGE: Disseminating guidelines had little effect on practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six months after surveillance coordinators were introduced, adherence to the planned surveillance interval increased from 17% to 92% and the number of endoscopies at which sufficient biopsies were collected increased from 45% to 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These changes have been maintained </plain></SENT>
