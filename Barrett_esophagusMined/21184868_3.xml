<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Three different classification systems for the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) using magnification endoscopy (ME) and narrow-band imaging (NBI) have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until now, no comparative and external evaluation of these systems in a clinical-like situation has been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare and validate these 3 classification systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective validation study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary-care referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine endoscopists with different levels of expertise from Europe and Japan participated as assessors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Thirty-two patients with long-segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: From a group of 209 standardized prospective recordings collected on BE by using ME combined with NBI, 84 high-quality videos were randomly selected for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologically, 28 were classified as gastric type mucosa, 29 as specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM), and 27 as SIM with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Assessors were blinded to underlying histology and scored each video according to the respective classification system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Before evaluation, an educational set concerning each classification system was carefully studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At each assessment, the same 84 videos were displayed, but in different and random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Accuracy for detection of nondysplastic and dysplastic SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement related to each classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median time for video evaluation was 25 seconds (interquartile range 20-39 seconds) and was longer with the Amsterdam classification (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In 65% to 69% of the videos, assessors described certainty about the histology prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The global accuracy was 46% and 47% using the Nottingham and Kansas classifications, respectively, and 51% with the Amsterdam classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The accuracy for nondysplastic SIM identification ranged between 57% (Kansas and Nottingham) and 63% (Amsterdam) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Accuracy for dysplastic tissue was 75%, irrespective of the classification system and assessor expertise level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement ranged from fair (Nottingham, κ = 0.34) to moderate (Amsterdam and Kansas, κ = 0.47 and 0.44, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: No per-patient analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the available classification systems could be used in a clinical-like environment, but with inadequate interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> classification systems based on combined ME and NBI, revealed substantial limitations in predicting nondysplastic and dysplastic BE when assessed externally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This technique cannot, as yet, replace random biopsies for histopathological analysis </plain></SENT>
