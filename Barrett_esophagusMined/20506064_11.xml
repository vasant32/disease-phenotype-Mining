<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> includes endoscopic inspection with biopsy of suspicious lesions followed by four-quadrant biopsy of the remaining mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the ability of probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) to replace biopsy in the endoscopic evaluation of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in a prospective and controlled setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 68 patients who were referred for endoscopic assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were included across three centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>pCLE recordings were interpreted live during the examination as well as in a blinded manner at least 3 months after endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>pCLE diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> based on pre-defined criteria was compared with histopathology from suspicious as well as four-quadrant biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 670 pairs of biopsies and pCLE video sequences were available for analysis, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) being histologically diagnosed in 8.3 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specificity and negative predictive value of pCLE in excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was 0.97 (90 %CI 0.95 - 0.98) and 0.93 (0.91 - 0.95) for the blinded evaluation, and 0.95 (0.90 - 0.98) and 0.92 (0.90 - 0.94) for the on-site assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive predictive values (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPVs</z:chebi>) and sensitivity were rather poor for both settings (46 %/28 % [blinded] and 18 %/12 % [on-site], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: pCLE can be regarded as non-inferior to endoscopic biopsy in excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, due to its low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and sensitivity, pCLE may currently not replace standard biopsy techniques for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further technical development of pCLE and a better understanding of its role in relation to other imaging technologies are necessary </plain></SENT>
