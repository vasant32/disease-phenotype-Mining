<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is a need for ancillary biomarkers to increase the sensitivity of cytology and to allow identification of patients at increased risk for disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of fluorescence in situ hybridization of endoscopic brush cytology specimens and to determine if there are specific chromosomal changes in cytologic specimens from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> that are not present in patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Archival cytology slides from 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were studied: 8 negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 8 positive for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to detect two alterations: HER-2 gene (17q11.2-q12) and 20q13.2 region amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: For 7 of 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cases, there was amplification/aneusomy of at least one of the two analyzed regions by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the samples negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were abnormal for either of the two genomic regions studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization is feasible by using routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cytologic specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in genomic makeup can be detected in cells from patients negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and in those with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
