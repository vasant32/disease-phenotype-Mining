<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It occurs as a result of transient or persistent reduction in lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, influenced to some degree by the presence or absence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and the failure of the usual clearance mechanisms that normally rid the distal esophagus of noxious materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heartburn and regurgitation are the most common symptoms, but extraesophageal symptoms related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation itself is often diagnostic, but techniques such as endoscopy, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> swallow, and pH monitoring are confirmatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Management generally involves life-style changes with or without added pharmacologic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A small percentage of patients require antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic management options include acid-neutralizing agents such as antacids and alginate, prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide and cisapride, and antisecretory drugs such as the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> H2 blockers and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Once the patient is healed pharmacologically, maintenance pharmacologic therapy is necessary to prevent relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antireflux surgery may be indicated in patients whose diagnosis is clear, who respond well to pharmacologic therapy, but who, for one reason or another, are not candidates for long-term pharmacologic management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preventing the advent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is one goal of therapy, because of the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
