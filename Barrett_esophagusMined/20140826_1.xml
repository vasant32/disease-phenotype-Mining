<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is some controversy on whether HFPs are superior in the T staging of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or whether the same level of accuracy can be achieved by the sole use of crEUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred for endoscopic treatment for Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were included in this prospective crossover trial and were randomly assigned to either HFPs or crEUS as the initial diagnostic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Afterwards, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients were re-examined with the alternative procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The staging results obtained with each method were documented prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 43 patients (median age 66 years [interquartile range: 58 - 73]; 34-male) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 23 mucosal and 16 submucosal Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were confirmed at histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological confirmation was not possible in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the T category was not possible with HFPs in 7 % of patients, compared with 33 % with crEUS ( P &lt; 0.0001) due to positioning problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>T category was correctly assessed with HFP in 64 % of patients and with crEUS in 49 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HFPs are significantly superior to crEUS for local staging of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the accuracy of assessment of the T category was unsatisfactory with both techniques </plain></SENT>
