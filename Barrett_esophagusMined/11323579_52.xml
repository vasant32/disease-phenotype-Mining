<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">Acetic acid</z:chebi> instillation enhances the ability to detect columnar epithelium at the squamocolumnar union </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enhanced magnification endoscopy involves the combined use of magnification endoscopy with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the value of enhanced magnification endoscopy in detecting SIM in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing endoscopic surveillance because of short segment BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> underwent enhanced magnification endoscopy with 1.5% <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> instillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standard endoscopy was followed by magnification endoscopy and repeated after <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> spraying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surface patterns were characterized prior to and after <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> spraying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observed surface patterns were compared with histology results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-nine patients, 9 women and 39 men, with a mean age of 50.5 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One was excluded because of unclear definition of the surface pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Enhanced magnification endoscopy detected 4 different mucosal surface patterns: I, round pits; II, reticular; III, villous; and IV, ridged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 129 areas were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Standard endoscopy identified an endoscopic pattern in 1.5% of the areas, standard endoscopy and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> in 8.5%, magnification endoscopy alone in 38%, and enhanced magnification endoscopy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 129 endoscopic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The yields for detecting SIM according to endoscopic patterns were as follows: pattern I, 0%; II, 11% (odds ratio 0.5, p = 0.54); III, 87% (odds ratio 36, p = 0.001); and IV, 100% (odds ratio 14, p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced magnification endoscopy is an accurate method of predicting SIM in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The simplicity of the technique and its ability to identify characteristic endoscopic patterns with outstanding clarity and resolution that correlate with histologic identification of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> make enhanced magnification endoscopy an excellent method for the evaluation of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
