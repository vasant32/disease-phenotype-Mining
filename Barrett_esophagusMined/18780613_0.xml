<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyze the correlation between the failure of medical treatment in patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and LES function, manometrically measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: This is a prospective study of 24 patients admitted in our clinic for reflux disease symptoms, who were investigated by endoscopy (combined with biopsy), esophageal manometry and 24 h pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The including criteria for the patients was abnormal esophageal exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, each patient having abnormal 24 h pH monitoring (pH &lt; 4 in the esophagus more then 4.4% in 24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient received medical treatment with clinic and endoscopic reevaluation after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From the 24 patients that were included: 4 patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (3 patients associated complications such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo>) and 7 patients without visible lesions on endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the 24 patients, 11 patients presented an incompetent LES, characterized by the following values obtained by manometry: total length &lt; or = 2 cm, abdominal length &lt; or = 1 cm, mean pressure: &lt; 6 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 2 patients from the 4 having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> that presented an incompetent LES, and also the 3 patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> associated with complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were reevaluated clinically and endoscopically after 3 months of medical treatment with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> 40 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the 11 patients with incompetent LES, 5 patients had symptoms or modifications on endoscopy, whereas from 13 patients with a competent LES only one patient presented with symptoms of reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of an incompetent LES may be a cause of a poor response to medical treatment and may also be an element for taking into consideration surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
