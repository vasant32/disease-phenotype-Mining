<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, the SCMJ is located within 2 cm of the proximal margin of the gastric folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proximal margin of the gastric folds in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> pouch provide a fixed, reproducible, anatomic landmark at endoscopy, which designates the junction of the muscular wall of the esophagus and stomach and permits one to predict the expected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> location of the SCMJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of CLE should be considered at endoscopy when either the SCMJ is located or columnar epithelium is obtained by biopsy at a site greater than 2 cm above the proximal margin of the gastric folds located within a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> pouch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study provides an endoscopic criterion to permit a more accurate diagnosis of CLE in its earliest stages and may permit a better assessment of its prevalence </plain></SENT>
