<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study 260 patients underwent primary laparoscopic antireflux surgery; 44 of them were suspected to have esophageal shortening on the basis of: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or evidence of peptic stricture formation on endoscopy; (2) an irreducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> &gt; or = 5 cm in length on upright <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> esophagram; or (3) a short esophagus on manometric analysis, defined as 2 SD below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients without preoperative criteria required extensive esophageal mobilization and intraoperative endoscopic/laparoscopic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative results were then compared with intraoperative esophageal length assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 13 patients (5% of the whole series) underwent a lengthening procedure: left thoracoscopically assisted laparoscopic Collis gastroplasty (n = 11) or open transthoracic Collis gastroplasty (n = 2) plus antireflux repair (Nissen fundoplication in 9 and Toupet repair in 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the preoperative tests, endoscopy had the highest sensitivity rate (61%); a combination of tests resulted in an increase in the specificity (63-100%) without a corresponding increase in sensitivity (28-42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative testing is thus useful for predicting the need for an esophageal lengthening procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy is the best screening test for the short esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A well planned prospective trial to test the reliability of each test is needed </plain></SENT>
