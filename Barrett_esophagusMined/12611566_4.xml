<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are conflicting data concerning the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) on esophageal motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: Duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> might affect severity of symptoms, grade of esophageal mucosal injury, and esophageal motor behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study of a defined cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: Two referral centers, one of them academic, for esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854121" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal motility disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred forty-seven patients with documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms, grade of mucosal injury on esophagoscopy, esophageal manometry, ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring, and esophagogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> had significantly decreased lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure (P =.02), lower amplitude of esophageal peristalsis at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels of measurement (P&lt;.001), and more delayed esophageal transit (P =.007) compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> presented with a longer history of the disease, significantly worse esophageal motor function (P&lt;.01), and more prolonged esophageal transit than patients without the above features of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Impairment of esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure were significantly inversely related to the duration of the disease (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, delay of esophageal transit was significantly related to the duration of the disease (P =.002) and inversely related to the amplitude of esophageal peristalsis (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unlike the manometric variables, the extent of reflux, as assessed by ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, was not related to the duration of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A long history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is more commonly associated with presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, delayed esophageal transit, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and impaired esophageal motility </plain></SENT>
