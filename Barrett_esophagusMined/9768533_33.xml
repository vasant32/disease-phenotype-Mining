<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because of the malignant potential of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, an aim of treatment is to cause the columnar epithelium to regress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A logical approach is to decrease <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> which is an important aetiological factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 20-80 mg over 1-3 years has yielded conflicting but largely disappointing results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine if treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 20 mg daily for up to 6 years can cause regression of the Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were treated in an open prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were treated for 2 years, 12 for 3 years, 10 for 4 years, eight for 5 years and eight for 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were endoscoped at 1-2-year intervals and endoscoped at the end of the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant shortening of the length of the Barrett's segment was seen during any treatment period, although <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> controlled reflux symptoms and was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic squamous islands appeared in 55% of patients, mostly in the first 2-3 years although in five patients they appeared later in treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 20 mg daily for periods of up to 6 years did not cause regression in the length of the Barrett's segment, but it did lead in over half of the patients to partial re-epithelialization in the form of squamous islands </plain></SENT>
