<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Villin is a cytoskeletal protein that is involved in the formation of brush-border microvilli in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> small intestine and colon epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This protein is present in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> but is reported not to be expressed in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed villin protein expression in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and in both Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis was used to evaluate the expression and cellular localization of the villin protein in 21 cases of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, 30 cases of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 16 cases of gastric cardia <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and eight cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Southern, northern, and western blot analyses were used to evaluate the potential mechanisms for regulation of villin protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Villin protein expression was observed in 21 of 21 cases (100%) of intestinal-type Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and in 28 of 30 cases (93%) of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and was thus highly expressed in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis demonstrated villin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (3.5 and 2.7 kb) in both villin-positive Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis with the antibody used for immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of a single villin protein band of 95 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abundant villin expression also was present in both <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the gastric cardia (13 of 16 cases; 81%) and distal esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of unknown origin (six of eight cases; 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intestinal brushborder enzyme sucrase isomaltase was found to be present in only 22 of 46 cases (48%) of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> that expressed villin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the protein villin is highly expressed in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and is well maintained in these and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
