<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sphincter pressure (LOSP), abdominal length of sphincter, and overall sphincter length were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Sphincter Function Index (SFI) was calculated as the product of sphincter pressure and percentage sphincter length (AL) exposed to abdominal pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients also had routine endoscopy and 24 hour pHmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SFI values discriminated between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LOSP was significantly different for Barrett's (p &lt; 0.01) and Nutcracker (p &lt; 0.01) compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AL was significant for Refluxers (p &lt; 0.001) and Barrett's (p &lt; 0.001) compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SFI gives better discrimination than LOSP or AL alone and may be useful in evaluating the response to treatment </plain></SENT>
