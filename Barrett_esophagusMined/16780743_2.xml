<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with BE were diagnosed according to new standard by endoscopy and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence, form in endoscopy, histology of biopsy, age, sex, symptom, Helicobacter pylori (Hp) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and relationship between BE and RE were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE was 7.90% of the total endoscopy number, and male vs female was 1.98, mean age (45.1 +/- 14.8) years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 19.15% of BE patients had typical reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>81.20% of BE patients were with short segment BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was detected in 34.83% of BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> 9.88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>39.94% of BE patients were infected with Hp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with RE (2.07%) were significantly less than those of BE (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>8.42% of BE patients were also with RE and 32.11% of RE patients were also with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of BE in Fujian of China is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most of BE are short segment BE and male and have no typical reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> is found in 1/3 of BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There isn't a close association between BE and RE </plain></SENT>
