<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As endoscopists have become more skilled in sampling the gastroesophageal junction, pathologists are being increasingly challenged to characterize previously unknown or neglected findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One such example is the cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Originally described in the radiology literature as the sentinel fold, the first histologic descriptions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> at the gastroesophageal junction did not appear until less than a decade ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Current clinicopathologic information is limited and somewhat conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to define the clinical, endoscopic, and histopathologic associations in patients with cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using an electronic database, we extracted information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had a distal esophageal or esophagogastric junctional biopsy during a 24-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We then reviewed the slides of 330 adult patients diagnosed with a cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> and used semiquantitative or qualitative scales to score foveolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, epithelial type, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As controls we used 120,487 patients who had biopsies from the same anatomic sites during the same period, but were not diagnosed with a cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences among any clinical indications for esophagogastroduodenoscopy between study and control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endoscopically, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> or nodule at the gastroesophageal junction was noted in 59.1% of the patients who had a histopathologic diagnosis of cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologically, Barrett mucosa, active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and Helicobactor pylori <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly less common in patients with a cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although relatively infrequent, synchronous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> elsewhere in the stomach were significantly more common in patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this large series suggests that cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> are rare but histologically distinct lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>They are benign and are not uniquely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reactive gastropathy</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, with or without H. pylori </plain></SENT>
