<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate their nature and significance, we retrospectively studied biopsies and resection specimens from symptomatic patients that showed the following histologies: unremarkable mucosa (11 cases), active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (11 cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e>: two cases; fungus: five cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (five cases), <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (three cases), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>H&amp;E sections were reviewed to determine the number of intraepithelial CINC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells with small, round nuclei typical of lymphocytes in five high-power fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> specimens were also stained for S-100 protein, and six additional biopsies with numerous CINC were stained for leukocyte common antigen (LCA), L-26 (a B-cell marker), and Leu-22 and UCHL-1 (both T-cell markers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical charts were reviewed to analyze endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CINC had the immunohistochemical profile of T-lymphocytes: LCA (+), Leu-22 (+), UCHL-1 (+), L-26 (-), and S-100 protein (-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their average number per high-power field was low in benign squamous epithelium away from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (average 0.8/high-power field) but much higher in biopsies with the other categories of histology, especially those with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (6.3/high-power field) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference between the mean of the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> groups (0.8) and that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (6.3) was statistically significant (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 11 patients with unremarkable biopsies, there was endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The biopsies of these five showed an average number of CINC of 6.4, whereas the number was only 3.5 in the six with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endoscopy (p = 0.15).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
