<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a risk factor of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It often occurs focally and cannot be distinguished from surrounding columnar epithelium with conventional endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of this study was evaluation of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> (MB) staining and magnification endoscopy with comparison of pit-pattern classifications according to Endo and Guelrud, in detection of SIM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five patients, aged 33-77 years (average 57 years), with displacement of Z line were prospectively enrolled and underwent gastroscopy with the use of magnification up to 115 times (Olympus GIF Q160Z) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy for histopathologic examination was taken from sites stained with MB and/or places with particular pit patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A control group consisted of ten patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastro-esophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SIM was proved in nine patients, and significantly more frequently in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and Barrett's segment longer than 3 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Round or thin linear pit patterns according to Guelrud's and small round and straight pit patterns according to Endo's classification were coupled with columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SIM was associated with deep linear and foveolar pit patterns in Guelrud's classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other pit patterns were less characteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both classifications had high sensitivity (Endo's 85.7%, Guelrud's 92.8%) but poor specificity (respectively, 21.15 and 28.4%) in detection of SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of MB staining were, respectively, 71.4 and 40.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite existing association between mucosal surface structure and histology, we find no convincing data indicating that pit-pattern evaluation may replace multiple biopsies taken according to recommendations from Seattle for detection of SIM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
