<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy with mucosal biopsy was performed in 97 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve (12.4%) were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of the endoscopic and radiologic examinations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy (92%) was significantly more sensitive than radiology (24%) in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency and severity of reflux symptoms among patients determined to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal biopsies were quantitatively similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups, except for significantly greater daytime heartburn in those with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> complicates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> more often than previously believed </plain></SENT>
