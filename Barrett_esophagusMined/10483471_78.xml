<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Partial or complete re-epithelization of the denuded segment by columnar mucus-secreting cells took place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Re-epithelization by squamous epithelium predominated in preparations with a competent inferior esophageal sphincter, while total or nearly total replacement by columnar cells characterized those preparations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and gastric hypersecretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peristalsis persisted in the operated portion of the esophagus as disclosed by esophageal manometry, although contractions were sometimes repetitive and prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurement of potential difference was useful in monitoring the re-epithelization process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These experiments support the concept that the columnar-lined distal esophagus ("<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>") may be an acquired condition in which squamous epithelium destroyed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> is replaced, through creeping substitution, by columnar cells of gastric or junctional origin </plain></SENT>
