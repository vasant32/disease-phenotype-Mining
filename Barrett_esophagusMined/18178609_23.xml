<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations in serum leptin and adiponectin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related cytokines, have been linked with several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and have been postulated as potential mediators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>; however, the relationship with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> remains unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum leptin and adiponectin concentrations were measured on two subsets of participants within a case-control study conducted in Brisbane, Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were people aged 18-79 years with histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> newly diagnosed between 2003 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Population controls, frequency matched by age and sex to cases, were randomly selected from the electoral roll </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phenotype and medical history data were collected through structured, self-completed questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the pilot analysis (51 cases, 67 controls) risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were highest among those in the highest quartile of serum leptin (OR 4.6, 95% CI 0.6 to 33.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association was seen with adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the leptin validation study (306 cases, 309 controls), there was a significant threefold increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> among men in the highest quartile of serum leptin (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 6.6) and this persisted after further adjustment for symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> among women decreased with increasing serum leptin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High serum leptin is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> among men but not women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This association is not explained simply by higher body mass or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> among cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mechanism remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
