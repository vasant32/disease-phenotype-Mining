<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited information is available on the natural history of this lesion, and studies suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is intermediate between that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Natural history studies of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> are hampered by problems with interobserver variability among pathologists and sampling variability among endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, the extent of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> has not been examined as a potential risk factor for the subsequent development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Srivastava et al., in this issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, found that the extent of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, as measured by several different methods, was a risk factor for progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While these findings are novel and provocative, it is premature to request your pathologist to count the number of crypts or biopsies with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> just yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these findings, if confirmed by studies utilizing a simpler measure of the extent of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, may help us determine the prognostic significance of this lesion in the future </plain></SENT>
