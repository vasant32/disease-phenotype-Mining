<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the histopathology of ER specimens of Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and correlate this with endoscopic characteristics to make recommendations for patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, INTERVENTIONS: Histology and correlating endoscopy reports of specimens obtained at 293 consecutive ERs performed at a Dutch tertiary referral center between 2000 and 2006 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Histologic findings in ER specimens and their relation with endoscopic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 150 ERs were performed for focal lesions: 16% type 0-I, 23% 0-IIa, 7% 0-IIb, 3% 0-IIc, 9% 0-IIa-IIb, and 42% 0-IIa-IIc; and 143 for flat mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histology revealed no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 57 ERs, low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in 52, high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in 104, T1m in 61, and T1sm in 17; in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, infiltration depth was not assessable because of artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 0-I and 0-IIc lesions significantly more often penetrated the submucosa (P = .009): 60% were G1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, 23% were G2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and 18% were G3 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>G2-G3 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> significantly more often invaded the submucosa (P &lt; .001) or had positive vertical margins (P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histology of ER specimens led to a change in diagnosis in 49% of the focal lesions and a relevant change in treatment policy in 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: A retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ER is a valuable diagnostic tool that frequently leads to a change in treatment policy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most endoscopically resected early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> are 0-II type, G1 mucosal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Submucosal infiltration is more often encountered in type 0-I and 0-IIc lesions and in G2-G3 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
