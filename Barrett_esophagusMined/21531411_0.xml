<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current ablation devices for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are effective but have significant limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a new ablation device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Laboratory and animal model evaluation of the CryoBalloon, a compliant balloon that is simultaneously inflated and cooled by liquid nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> delivered by using a small, disposable, handheld unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Cryoablation of esophageal mucosa was performed in 11 swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple ablations were created in each animal at various ablation times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Animals were euthanized at 4 days (n = 6) or 28 days (n = 5), and histological assessments were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 4 days, the percentage of esophageal mucosa successfully ablated was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 28 days, the circumference of the esophagus at the center of the ablation zone was measured to assess for stricture formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CryoBalloon was simple to operate, and balloon contact with tissue was easily maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the ablation time was increased from 6 to 12 seconds, the percentage of mucosa ablated increased from below 60% to above 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Maximal effect on the mucosa was reached at 12 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ablation of up to 14 seconds resulted in minimal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As the ablation duration increased from 14 to 22 seconds, there was progressive stricture formation evident at 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the animals tolerated the treatments without difficulty and, regardless of ablation duration, were able to continue oral intake and gain weight after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Ablation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> porcine squamous mucosa may differ from that of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CryoBalloon device enables circumferential mucosal ablation in a 1-step process by using a novel, through-the-scope balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The maximal effect on the mucosa is achieved with a 12-second application time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Because of its ease of use, this new device merits further study so that we can find its possible role in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
