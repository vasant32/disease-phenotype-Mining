<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">Proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) are frequently prescribed to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), but in a subset, they can induce significant hypergastrinemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of gastrin have been associated with tumorigenic effects in a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We decided to investigate the association between serum gastrin levels and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study and enrolled patients with BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC), as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> controls, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chronically taking <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum gastrin was measured, and data were collected on patient characteristics, medication use, and the highest degree of BE <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 64.7 (+/-10.0) years, and 70.5% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median serum gastrin level was 40 pM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in gastrin levels with increased degrees of BE <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (overall P=0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, the highest quartile of gastrin was associated with significantly increased odds of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGD or AC) (odds ratio (OR): 5.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-24.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In BE patients taking <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>, an elevated serum gastrin is associated with a history of HGD or AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are needed to determine whether patients with nondysplastic BE and elevated serum gastrin are at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
