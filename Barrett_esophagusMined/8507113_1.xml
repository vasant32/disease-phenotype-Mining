<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the local prevalence and optimal therapy for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), the authors studied children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER), or both, to diagnose BE and to follow after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is seldom reported in children and therapeutic recommendations are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> usually develops during the mucosal reparative process after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid-reflux</z:e> injury to the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for BE include conditions that are associated with GER such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo>, and reversed gastric tube esophagoplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's syndrome</z:e> increases the risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> by 30 to 40 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children with the risk factors had repeated esophagoscopy and multiple mucosal biopsies before and after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven children have been documented with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial diagnoses were: GER, 5; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo>, 4; nasogastric intubation, 1; lye ingestion, 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A gastric tube esophagoplasty had been performed in three patients with BE in the esophagus proximal to the anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three children with mid-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> and long segments of BE had total resection with colic interposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An additional two patients with tight stricture were treated with colic-patch esophagoplasty without resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The final three patients were treated with fundoplication alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> can be caused by acid from gastric tubes but responds to H2 blockers and diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Resection eliminates BE; esophagoplasty only controls the stricture and must be accompanied by fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> persists in patients with fundoplication alone if reflux control is incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> must be controlled to treat BE successfully or the involved segment must be resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Esophagogastrostomy apparently predisposes to BE </plain></SENT>
