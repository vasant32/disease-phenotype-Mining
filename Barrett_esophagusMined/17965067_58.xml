<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective multi-centre study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary referral centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 84 Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was inspected with HRE followed by AFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions detected with HRE and/or AFI were subsequently inspected in detail by NBI for the presence of abnormal mucosal and/or microvascular patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suspicious lesions for blinded histopathological assessment followed by random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Number of patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> diagnosed by HRE and AFI; (2) number of lesions with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> detected with HRE and AFI; and (3) reduction of false positive AFI findings after NBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Per patient analysis: AFI identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> identified with HRE and detected an additional 11 patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> that were not identified with HRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three patients no abnormalities were seen but random biopsies revealed HGIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After HRE inspection, AFI detected an additional 102 lesions; 19 contained HGIN/EC (false positive rate of AFI after HRE: 81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Detailed inspection with NBI reduced this false positive rate to 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this international multi-centre study, the addition of AFI to HRE increased the detection of both the number of patients and the number of lesions with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The false positive rate of AFI was reduced after detailed inspection with NBI </plain></SENT>
