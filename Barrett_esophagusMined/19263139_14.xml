<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reports the experience of a single surgeon using an endoscopic endoluminal device that delivers radiofrequency energy (the BARRx device) to ablate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent ablation of Barrett's epithelium with the BARRx system were reviewed for length of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, presence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, postprocedure complications, completeness of ablation at first follow-up endoscopy, need for additional ablation, completeness of ablation at second follow-up endoscopy, and concomitant performance of a Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six patients underwent Barrett's ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median length of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was 3 (range, 1-14) cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (18%) had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no immediate procedure-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four strictures occurred: three in patients with &gt; or = 12-cm segments of Barrett's and one in a 6-cm segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine of 49 patients (59%) who had planned 3-month follow-up endoscopy had complete ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients had planned two-stage ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with incomplete ablation had additional ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients had planned follow-up endoscopy at &gt; or = 1 year: 25 of 27 (93%) had biopsy-proven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in patients with initially incomplete ablation was 6 cm, compared with 2 cm in the initially complete ablation patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seven Nissen fundoplications were present at the time of ablation, whereas six were performed concomitantly with the ablation without increased difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Complete ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with radiofrequency endoluminal ablation is achievable in &gt; 90% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with longer segments are likely to require additional ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients with very long segments are at risk for stricture and should be approach cautiously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Performance of a fundoplication is not hindered by concomitant ablation </plain></SENT>
