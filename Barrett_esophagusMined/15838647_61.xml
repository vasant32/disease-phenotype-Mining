<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early lesions [i.e. high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or T1-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>] are potentially curable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local endoscopic therapies are promising treatment options for superficial lesions; however, for deeper lesions, surgical resection is considered to be the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To contribute to therapeutic decision-making, we retrospectively analysed the outcome of transhiatal esophagectomy in 120 patients with pathologically proven HGD (n=13) or T1-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n=107) of the distal esophagus or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were subdivided into six different depths of invasion ('T1-mucosal' m1-m3, 'T1-submucosal' sm1-sm3), and the frequency of lymphatic dissemination and time to locoregional and/or distant recurrence were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one of the 79 T1m1-3/sm1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (1%) showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> as compared with 18 out of 41 T1sm2-3 tumors (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in recurrence-free period between T1m1-m3/sm1 versus T1sm2-sm3 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> patients (P log rank &lt;0.0001), with 5-year recurrence-free percentages of 97% and 57%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis including age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation grade, N-stage and depth of invasion, only N-stage was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free period (hazard rate=5.9, 95% CI 1.7-20.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, if N-stage was excluded from analysis, only depth of invasion (T1sm2-3 versus T1m1-m3/sm1) was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free period (hazard rate=7.5, 95% CI 2.0-27.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that T1m1-m3/sm1 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of esophagus or GEJ show a very low risk of lymphatic dissemination and are therefore eligible for local endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After transhiatal surgical resection, almost half of the patients with T1sm2-sm3 lesions develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> within 5 years, and therefore need additional therapy to improve survival </plain></SENT>
