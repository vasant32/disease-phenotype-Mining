<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mayo Clinic records were reviewed, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases that met predefined histologic criteria for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 1979 or earlier were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 18 of 122 such cases, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were diagnosed simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The status of the remaining 104 cases was determined after a mean interval of 8.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During this time, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus developed in 2 patients, and 24 died from other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that although the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is increased in patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, it does not occur in the majority of such patients </plain></SENT>
