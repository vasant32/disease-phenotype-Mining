<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that several methods of endoscopic ablation in combination with acid suppression result in replacement of specialized columnar epithelium by squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether ablation of Barrett's mucosa by means of heat probe and acid suppression restores <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients with Barrett's epithelium but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Helicobacter pylori was eradicated when discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thermal energy was applied using a heat probe (pulses of 5 to 10 joules) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four-quadrant biopsies were obtained at 1 to 2 cm intervals 1 to 3 months after the last treatment session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients continuously took <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi>, 40 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Macroscopically, ablation of Barrett's mucosa was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after 1 to 5 sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of the 13 patients had residual specialized columnar epithelium beneath the restored mucosa but not overexpression of p53 and c-erbB-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (6 to 36 months) two patients in whom the length of Barrett's mucosa was greater than 2.5 cm relapsed after <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> discontinuation, whereas another two with length of less than 2.5 cm did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient with residual Barrett's islands developed low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Heat probe is an effective and inexpensive method for Barrett's ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Islands of residual specialized columnar epithelium were found in 23% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The length of Barrett's epithelium determines relapse after <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> discontinuation </plain></SENT>
