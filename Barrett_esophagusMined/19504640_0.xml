<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy male Sprague Dawley rats aged 8 weeks were randomly divided into 4 groups: in Group A (n=20) esophagojejunostomy was performed to induce a gastro-jejuno-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e>; in Group B (n=20) esophagoduodenostomy was performed to induce a gastro-duodeno-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e>; in Group C (n=20) total gastrectomy plus esophagojejunostomy was performed to induce a jejuno-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">esophageal reflux</z:e>; in Group D (n=10) only was performed sham operation (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Among 70 rats, 6 died in Group A, 7 died in Group B, 6 died in Group C, and 72.9 %(51/70) animals were completed in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> was 100.0%; in Groups A, B and C <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> occurred in 11/14 (78.6%), 10/13 (76.9%), 3/14 (21.4%) of animals, respectively; squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was in 10/14 (71.4%), 10/13 (76.9%), 5/14 (35.7%) of rats, respectively; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was in 6/14 (42.9%), 5/13 (38.5%), 1/14 (7.1%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was found in Group A; no histological changes were observed in Group D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The animal models of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> can be induced by esophagojejunostomy, esophagoduodenostomy or total gastrectomy plus esophago-jejunostomy in rats; and the former two surgical modalities are better than the later </plain></SENT>
