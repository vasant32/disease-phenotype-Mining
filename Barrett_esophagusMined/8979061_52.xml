<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is mainly regarded as an acquired condition related to increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus it is conceivable that abolition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> would lead to its regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether long-term treatment with high-dose <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (60 mg/day) produces a consistent control of gastric acid production and normalizes the esophageal acid exposure, thus reducing the length of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients (8 men and 6 women, mean age 52 years) with histologic diagnosis of columnar epithelium longer than 3 cm in the distal part of the esophagus were enrolled and began receiving 60 mg of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> in a single daily morning dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before therapy and after 6 and 12 months of therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had endoscopy with four-quadrant biopsies at 2 cm intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 24-hour esophagogastric pH recording was performed at entry and after 10 days, 6 months, and 12 months of treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The initial length of Barrett's epithelium (4.5 +/- 1.9 cm) was significantly reduced after 6 months (3.1 +/- 1.1; p &lt; 0.01) and 12 months (2.1 +/- 1.6; p &lt; 0.005) of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Values were significantly lower at 12 than at 6 months (p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 24-hour mean gastric pH after 10 days (5.89 +/- 0.58), 6 months (5.71 +/- 0.55), and 12 months (5.54 +/- 0.76) of therapy was always higher (p &lt; 0.001) than the basal level (1.9 +/- 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in gastric pH was seen over the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 24-hour mean percent of time in which pH in the esophagus was below 4.0 decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.001) from a basal rate of 29.4% to 3.5%, 3.0%, and 4.9% in the various time intervals of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a normalization of esophageal acid exposure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that the antisecretory effect of 60 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> is consistent and is kept constant throughout the entire 1-year treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The consequent normalization of esophageal acid exposure in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in our series led to a partial, but significant, regression in the length of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
