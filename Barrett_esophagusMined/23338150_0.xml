<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of telomerase in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity was measured in Barrett's cells using terminal restriction fragment (TRF) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telomere length was measured using Q-FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the telomere recombination events were detected between sister chromatids using chromosome orientation FISH (CO-FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a reduction in telomerase activity in the CP-A cells transduced with MT-hTER/47A+siRNA, which led to an almost complete disappearance of telomerase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The telomere length of the CP-A cells transduced with MT-hTER/47A+siRNA was slightly shorter compared to that of the untransduced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The telomerase-inhibited cells were morphologically indistinguishable from those untransduced and WT-hter-transduced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control cells, the growth rate was between 0.9 to 1.1 with the population doubling per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the transduction of the telomerase inhibitors in the CP-A cells did not cause a significant reduction in cell growth, these transduced cells grew generally slower compared with the control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> telomere length was also be detected in the telomerase-inhibited CP-A cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the telomere length remained homogeneous in the control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The metaphase of the CP-A cells transduced with MT-hTER/47A+siRNA demonstrated 70% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, no increased recombination was observed between sister chromatids in the transduced CP-A cells compared with the control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) may be induced by telomerase inhibitors in CP-A cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, telomerase inhibitors may exhibit high potency in the treatment of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
