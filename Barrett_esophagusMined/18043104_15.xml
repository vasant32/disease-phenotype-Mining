<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of endoscopic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) for ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: APC has been used to ablate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the long-term outcome of this treatment is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study reports 5-year results from a randomized trial of APC versus surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> in patients who had undergone a fundoplication for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> were randomized to undergo either ablation using APC or ongoing surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a mean 68 months after treatment, 40 patients underwent endoscopy follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of treatment, durability of the neosquamous re-epithelialization, and safety of the procedure were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initially, at least 95% ablation of the metaplastic mucosa was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the 5-year follow-up, 14 of 20 APC patients continued to have at least 95% of their previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> replaced by neosquamous mucosa, and 8 of these had complete microscopic regression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of the 20 surveillance patients had more than 95% regression of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and 4 of these had complete microscopic regression (1 after subsequent APC treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> shortened significantly in both study groups, although the extent of regression was greater after APC treatment (mean 5.9-0.8 cm vs. 4.6-2.2 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients who had undergone APC treatment developed a late <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, which required endoscopic dilation, and 2 patients in the surveillance group developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> after fundoplication is more likely, and greater in extent, in patients who undergo ablation with APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In most patients treated with APC the neosquamous mucosa remains stable at up to 5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The development of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> only occurred in patients who were not treated with APC </plain></SENT>
