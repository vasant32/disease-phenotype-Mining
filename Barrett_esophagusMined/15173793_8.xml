<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the mucosal effects of esophagogastrostomy, an artificial interface between esophageal squamous and gastric oxyntic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EGD was performed in 14 consecutive patients (median age 63 years, range 26-71 years) who had undergone esophagogastrostomy from 3 to 88 months earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were obtained in 13 patients from the anastomosis and, when present, columnar epithelium in the remnant esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 10 patients, EGD demonstrated tongue-shaped segments of columnar epithelium extending from 0.3 to 7 cm into the remnant esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens revealed cardia-type mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, whether at the anastomosis or proximally in esophageal segments of columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnification endoscopy of cardia-type mucosa visualized a long-oval, tubular, or ridged surface pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases, complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was observed within the cardia-type mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequent transformation of squamous epithelium into cardia-type mucosa in the distal remnant esophagus after esophagogastrostomy supports the concept that cardia-type mucosa is a reflux-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> that may give rise to the subsequent development of specialized intestinalized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
