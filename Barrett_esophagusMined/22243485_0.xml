<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the impact of TNF gene variation on the RE-BE-EAC cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA from 887 Caucasian participants (197 controls, 305 RE, 257 BE, 128 EAC) was tested for the gene polymorphism TNF-β NcoI, and TNF production was determined by TNF-α specific immunohistochemistry on esophageal biopsies from these BE (n = 31) and EAC (n = 4) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As compared with healthy controls, the TNF-β NcoI A/A genotype was significantly more prevalent in BE (p = 0.04) and EAC patients (p = 0.02), but not in RE patients (p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While TNF-α protein levels were invariably high in esophageal biopsies from EAC patients, most esophageal BE samples showed low to moderate TNF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, like in BE, markedly increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, the significantly higher frequency of the TNF-β NcoI A/A genotype and the local TNF expression indicate that the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF plays a role in the development of BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
