<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Until recently, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) at the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) was ascribed to Barrett's mucosa (BM), which arises from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies, however, have shown that IM at the SCJ can also be induced, for example, by Helicobacter pylori (HP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether the type of IM might be helpful in the differentiation between these two aetiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsies from the antrum, corpus and immediately below the Z-line were taken from 443 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three of them showed IM below the Z-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these, the endoscopic aspect of the Z-line was classified as either unremarkable (n=49) or suspected of BM (n=34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Typing of IM was done using Gomori's <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> fuchsin-Alcian blue staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, age, HP status and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267055" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erosive oesophagitis</z:e> had no influence on the IM type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type-III IM (n=24) was more frequent in men (P=0.0371) and related to endoscopic BM (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Type-I/II IM (n=59) was associated with an unremarkable Z-line (P&lt;0.0001) and was linked to multifocal gastric IM (P=0.016) and HP (P=0.0011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it was shown that, in the presence of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Z-line, especially in the absence of HP, type-III IM is suggestive of BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of short or ultra-short segment BM should therefore include endoscopic, histological and histochemical characteristics </plain></SENT>
