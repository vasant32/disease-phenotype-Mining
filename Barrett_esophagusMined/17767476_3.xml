<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is an overexpression of cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the long-term effect of a COX-2 inhibitor on cellular mechanisms involved in BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in BO patients allocated to continue the usual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) alone treatment, or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> (25 mg/day) for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation index and COX-2 expression in BO glands was determined in biopsy specimens at baseline and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cyclin D1, p53 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was also explored in a subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Student-t test and the U-Mann-Whitney test were used for quantitative and ordinal variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 62 patients, 58 completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A higher proportion of patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> exhibited a decrease in COX-2 expression compared to those treated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> alone, but cell proliferation index was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> alone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> was associated with an increase in the apoptotic cell index, a decrease in p53 cell staining and VEGF expression in mucosal vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No effect on low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or cyclin D1 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy does not affect cell proliferation index in BO cells after 6 months of therapy, but does reduce COX-2 and VEGF expression and increases cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
