<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since there are few studies examining <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) in healthy children beyond infancy, we report our experiences treating children older than two with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GER was diagnosed by either an abnormal extended intraesophageal pH monitoring (pH study) or presence of histological <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients met the criteria, ages 3 to 19 years (mean 11) and 68% were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Common symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, abdominal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, heartburn and regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of symptoms was 28.7 months, and six patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were older and had strongly positive pH study parameters compared to the rest of patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with prokinetic and acid reducing agents for 8 to 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two percent responded to initial course and remained asymptomatic during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nissen fundoplication was recommended to five patients (13.5% of study population) because of refractory GER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of these patients who required surgery had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, GER in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> older children is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease with potentially severe complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients should be evaluated by pH study and endoscopic esophageal biopsies, and have careful follow up </plain></SENT>
