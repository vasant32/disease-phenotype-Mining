<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a rare case of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> asso-ciated with acquired eventration of the diaphragm in a 71-year-old woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She initially developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and epigastric discomfort in May, 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On July 9, she was referred to our Department of Surgery at the Ryukyus University Hospital for thorough examination and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and eventration of the diaphragm were revealed by exhaustive examinations, including chest X-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, and proximal gastrectomy with reconstruction of jejunal interposition was performed, on August 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> revealed that the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arose from short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It thus appears that eventration of the diaphragm may induce SSBE and Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We therefore recommend that periodic examinations of the esophagus and stomach be performed in patients with eventration of the diaphragm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> associated with acquired eventration of the diaphragm is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with eventration of the diaphragm should undergo periodic examinations of the esophagus and stomach </plain></SENT>
