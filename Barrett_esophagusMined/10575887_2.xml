<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some selected cases there is an indication for oesophageal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1983 to 1997, 12 patients underwent oesophagectomy for "complicated" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> for many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten of them were symptomatic, and pH-manometric alterations as well as alterations were noted at biliary scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients had previous antireflux operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four had a long (3-5 cm) and undilatable stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One was affected by a perforating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had an indefinite grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> but endosonography revealed high suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients had a high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Operative technique consisted of a transhiatal oesophagectomy in nine cases and a laparotomic and right thoracotomic oesophagectomy (Ivor-Lewis) in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no 30-day mortality; three post operative complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One of the four patients suffering from stricture died four years after intervention due to non-related causes; the other three are still living and regularly feed per os after 12, 9 and 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> is still living after 6 years and regularly feeding per os </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The patient suffering from an indefinite grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (stage IIa) on the operative specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The patient is still living after 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Three patients operated for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> on the specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Two patients (stage I) are living after 3 and 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>One patient (stage IIa) died after 19 months with recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In case of non neoplastic "complicated" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> the indication for the oesophageal resection can be considered as the extreme useful therapy only after an accurate selection of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Especially in case of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the great incidence of unexpected <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> indicates oesophagectomy for patients who are suitable for surgery </plain></SENT>
