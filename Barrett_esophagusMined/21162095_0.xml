<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our brief report analyses the role of brush cytology (BC) in its diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients who presented with upper gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations and subsequently diagnosed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with or without <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> on brush cytology (BC) or, endoscopic biopsy (EB) or, a combination of both the techniques were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases routine cytologic smears and histologic sections with relevant special stains (when essential) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On cytology, the diagnosis of "<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>" was made when the esophageal brushings obtained from a region beyond 3 cm from the gastroesophageal junction showed closely intermingled clusters of squamous and columnar cells, or when there was evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was diagnosed by the usual criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> with features of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytologic diagnoses were correlated with the histologic diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the eight cases, seven had histopathologic correlation of which six had evidence of BE on BC; four had cytohistologic concordance, of which three cases revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two endoscopic biopsies were nonrepresentative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one case, cytology missed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For two cases in which cytology detected Barrett's mucosa, biopsies were nonrepresentative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study showed brush cytology (BC) to be a fairly reliable test for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Owing to its inherent advantage of sampling a wider and circumferential area, a technically well performed brushing procedure is likely to be more representative and superior than multiple endoscopic biopsies </plain></SENT>
