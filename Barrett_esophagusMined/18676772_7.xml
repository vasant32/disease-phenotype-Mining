<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to investigate telomere function in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BEAC) cells purified by laser capture microdissection and to evaluate the effect of telomerase inhibition in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Epithelial cells were purified from surgically resected esophagi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity was measured by modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol and telomere length was determined by real-time PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effect of telomerase inhibition, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines were continuously treated with a specific telomerase inhibitor (GRN163L) and live cell number was determined weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was evaluated by Annexin labeling and senescence by beta-galactosidase staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For in vivo studies, severe combined immunodeficient mice were s.c. inoculated with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells and following appearance of palpable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, injected i.p. with saline or GRN163L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Telomerase activity was significantly elevated whereas telomeres were shorter in BEAC cells relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells with telomerase inhibitor, GRN163L, led to loss of telomerase activity, reduction in telomere length, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> through induction of both the senescence and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GRN163L-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> could also be expedited by addition of the chemotherapeutic agents <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and ritonavir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the treatment with GRN163L led to a significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume in a subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We show that telomerase activity is significantly elevated whereas telomeres are shorter in BEAC and suppression of telomerase inhibits proliferation of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
