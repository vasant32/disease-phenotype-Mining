<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is considered to be a major risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied the prevalence of clinical, histological and endoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, and premalignant changes among dyspeptic Iranian patients referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consenting patients referred for UGIE to our clinic were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their symptoms were recorded, UGIE was conducted, and biopsies from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suspicious lesions and across the Z-line were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 344 enrolled patients, 269 (135 women, 134 men; mean age: 41.6 years) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One major <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptom (heart burn, acid regurgitation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>) was seen in 209 (77.6%) patients, and 207 patients (76.1%) had endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (5%) had specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the gastrointestinal junction (SIM-GEJ), and three had <z:mp ids='MP_0002163'>glandular dysplasia</z:mp> (two low-grade, one high-grade) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No symptom could predict the presence of histological or endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had more advanced degrees of endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> is common among Iranian patients referred for diagnostic endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of SIM-GEJ among this population was comparable to that reported in Western countries </plain></SENT>
