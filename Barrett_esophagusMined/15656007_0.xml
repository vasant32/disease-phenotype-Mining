<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> is on a constant rise in western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reflux therapy can be subdivided into the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> erosive reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and the subsequent recurrence prophylaxis, and into the treatment of non-erosive reflux disease as well as the atypical reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on conventional large-scale studies, a highly effective therapy is available which offers virtually complete acid blockade using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) of the prazole type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment, they offer a cure for reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and freedom from symptoms in approx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>90% of the cases, while also showing high efficacy in recurrence prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the rate of side effects, particularly serious ones, is very low and the long-term safety of this therapy has been good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since the risk of erosive reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> recurring is &gt; 80% without <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy, the majority of the patients will require a long-term, potentially even life-long therapy with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other therapeutic options are being discussed as alternatives to such long-term prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In selected cases, surgical therapy by laparoscopic fundoplication is one option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, endoscopical anti-reflux procedures are increasingly coming into use; their merit in long-term prophylaxis however, cannot yet be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whenever <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy does not lead to complete freedom from symptoms, an alternative therapeutic approach should be given consideration even in patients with atypical reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The therapy of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, a potentially long-term sequelae of reflux disease, will not be dealt with in this overview, as it is the subject of a separate presentation </plain></SENT>
