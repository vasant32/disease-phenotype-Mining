<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Esophagectomy carries high morbidity, mainly due to respiratory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In digestive surgery, postoperative outcome is generally improved by minimally invasive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A prospective study was conducted to evaluate feasibility and postoperative outcome of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 2001 to June 2004, 20 patients underwent esophagectomy with laparoscopic gastric mobilization (LGM) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (N=11), <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (N=7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (N=1), and long peptic stricture (N=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumours</z:e> (N=19) were located on the cardia (N=5), on the lower third of the oesophagus (N=10), on the median third (N=3), and on the upper third (N=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following LGM, transthoracic (N=19) or transhiatal (N=1) oesophagectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete LGM was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean operative time for LGM was 197+/-48 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 19 patients operated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, 18 underwent R0 resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (55%) developed postoperative complications, mainly (30%) respiratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intrathoracic anastomotic leakage occurred in 2 patients, with favourable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pylorospasm</z:e> (N=1) was the only intraabdominal complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient died (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Esophagectomy with LGM is feasible with few specific complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, no decrease in morbidity could be observed with this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to evaluate if thoracoscopy could improve the postoperative course after LGM and to validate oncologic safety of MIE </plain></SENT>
