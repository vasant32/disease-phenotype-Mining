<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Unsedated esophagoscopy with ultrathin endoscopes is a valuable screening modality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but the stomach and the duodenum cannot be examined completely with the smallest and best tolerated of these endoscopes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no data as to how often disease in the stomach and the duodenum would be missed when using this screening strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis is that patients with reflux symptoms, in the absence of daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, or history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, were unlikely to have clinically significant gastroduodenal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients scheduled for upper endoscopy at a single outpatient endoscopy unit in a tertiary referral center were screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criterion was reflux symptoms as the primary indication for upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with another valid indication were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A detailed history was recorded and symptom questionnaire completed for each patient before endoscopy; these data were compared with the endoscopy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 175 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indications for upper endoscopy were the following: worsening symptoms (n=74), ongoing reflux despite therapy (n=27), and long-standing reflux (n=74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major esophageal findings were discovered in 95 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients, major gastric or duodenal findings were detected as follows: erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (n=8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcer</z:hpo> (n=2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo> (n=2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341245" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erosive duodenitis</z:e> (n=2), and duodenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (p=0.014) or possibly daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (p=0.028 unadjusted, 0.197 adjusted) was associated with major gastric/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013289" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients without daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, or a history of gastric/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo> were much less likely to have major disease (0.9%) than patients with one of these predictors (13.2%, p=0.00097) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, in combination with a history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> disease, are strong predictors of major gastric or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013289" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with reflux without these predictors are highly unlikely to have a major disease involving the stomach or duodenum, and are suitable candidates for esophagoscopy alone </plain></SENT>
