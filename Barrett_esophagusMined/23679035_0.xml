<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In long-term follow-up studies the focus has shifted from purely surgical or gastrointestinal evaluation to a multidisciplinary approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the long-term morbidity in adolescent and adult EA patients and discussed mainly nonsurgical issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> is common and reported in up to 85% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In young adults <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> occurs frequently with development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> in 6% reported in different series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is difficult to estimate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory morbidity</z:e> from the literature because many different definitions, questionnaires, and study designs have been used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, many patients seem to suffer from respiratory problems even into adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, morbidity is not only restricted to surgical problems but many different domains are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> related and together determine to a large extent the quality of life of EA patients and also of their families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We assume that a multidisciplinary care approach seems best to address their special needs </plain></SENT>
