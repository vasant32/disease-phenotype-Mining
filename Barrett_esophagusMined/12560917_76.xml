<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There have been no detailed reports directly comparing the expression of CDX1 with that of CDX2 in the inflammatory esophageal mucosa and Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to examine the expression of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi> 1/2 in inflammatory esophageal mucosa with or without Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of CDX1/2 genes was analyzed using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 34 human esophageal biopsy specimens, and CDX2 expression was also evaluated immunohistochemically, using anti-human CDX2 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biopsy specimens for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extraction were taken endoscopically from esophageal mucosa with mucosal break due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), Barrett's epithelium, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expressions of mucin markers (MUC2) and intestine-specific genes (sucrase-isomal-tase, human defensin-5, alkaline phosphatase) were also comparatively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CDX1/2 expression was not found in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of CDX1/2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in the mucosa with Barrett's epithelium than in the mucosa without Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy, however, that the CDX2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was initiated at the stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, when neither CDX1 nor intestine-specific genes had emerged yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to CDX2, CDX1 was expressed only in Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study demonstrated strong and extensive nuclear immunoreactivity for CDX2 in Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fine granular cytoplasmic staining was also observed in the cytoplasm in Barrett's epithelium, as well as in inflammatory esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report here, for the first time, that CDX2 is expressed in patients with Barrett's epithelium and inflammatory esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings imply that the expression of CDX2 may be an early event leading to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
