<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to analyze the correlation between the selected clinico-pathological parameters, and p53 protein overexpression in regards to the particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The material comprised 66 surgical specimens; 10 were Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, 25 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the gastric cardia (type II <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagogastric junction - EGJ), and 31 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for p53 protein was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, using the alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cases were considered positive for p53 if at least 5% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells expressed this protein by immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference observed between the studied groups in regards to age, sex, Lauren's classification and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a significant difference observed in the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> invasion between Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the cardia compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Namely, at the time of surgery, both Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the cardia, were significantly more advanced comparing with the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of p53 was found in 40% (4/10) of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, 72% (18/25) of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the cardia and 65% (20/31) of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in p53 expression in relation to sex, type (Lauren) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, depth of invasion, lymph node involvement, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> differentiation were observed in any of the analyzed groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with more advanced Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and in the cases of lymph node invasion revealed tendency for the greater p53 positivity compared with the early forms and lymph node-negative cases; however, this difference was not significant according to the statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With regard to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the cardia, higher rates of p53 positivity were recorded in poorly differentiated, more advanced cases with lymph node invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, none of these differences was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, in the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the antrum, greater p53 positivity was revealed in early forms without lymph node involvement, but the observed difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No significant differences in p53 protein expression in terms of sex, type (Lauren) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, depth of invasion, lymph node involvement, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> differentiation were observed in any of the analyzed groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the cardia and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the antrum) </plain></SENT>
