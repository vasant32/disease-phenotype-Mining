<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The impact of the diagnosis and treatment of dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> on quality of life (QoL) is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the influence of dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> on QoL and evaluated whether endoscopic treatment of dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) improves QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed changes in QoL in the AIM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> Trial, a multicenter study of patients with dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who were randomly allocated to RFA therapy or a sham intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed a 10-item questionnaire to assess the influence of dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> on QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire was completed by patients at baseline and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 127 patients were randomized to RFA (n = 84) or sham (n = 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, most patients reported worry about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> (71 % RFA, 85 % sham) and esophagectomy (61 % RFA, 68 % sham) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients also reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, impaired QoL, worry, stress, and dissatisfaction with the condition of their esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of those randomized, 117 patients completed the study to the 12-month end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the sham group, patients treated with RFA had significantly less worry about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> ( P=0.003) and esophagectomy ( P =0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They also had significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> ( P=0.02), general worry about the condition of their esophagus ( P≤0.001), impact on daily QoL ( P=0.009), stress ( P=0.03), dissatisfaction with the condition of their esophagus ( P≤0.001), and impact on work and family life ( P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion in the treatment group of this randomized, sham-controlled trial of RFA was associated with improvement in disease-specific health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This improvement appears secondary to a perceived decrease in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
