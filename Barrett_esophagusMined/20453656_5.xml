<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The diagnosis of adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341106" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eosinophilic oesophagitis</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EOE</z:e>) is rarely made in the UK despite projections of high frequency and prevalence within Western society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify the frequency of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EOE</z:e> in our community, and to establish reasons for diagnostic failure or delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The pathology records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gastroscopies performed (67 840) in Northumbria NHS trust during the years January 2001-November 2008 were reviewed for oesophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case notes and investigations were then inspected to identify patients with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EOE</z:e> in accordance with American Gastroenterology Association guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 37 patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EOE</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of symptoms before the diagnosis was 4 years (range 4 months-30 years) and 14 patients (38%) remained undiagnosed until the time of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reasons for diagnostic failure and delay included: delayed request for endoscopy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (49%, n=18 of 37); poor recognition of typical endoscopic appearances of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EOE</z:e> (16%, n=6 of 37); clinical mislabelling as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (22%, n=8 of 37) and candida (13%, n=5 of 37); histological mislabelling as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (19%, n=7 of 37), candida (5%, n=2 of 37), '<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>' (8%, n=3 of 37) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (3%, n=1 of 37); failed recognition or recording of maximal eosinophil concentrations within biopsies (35%, n=13 of 37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 40% (n=15 of 37) of patients the decision to biopsy was based solely on a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> protocol introduced in 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No cases were identified before the protocol implementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EOE</z:e> is underdiagnosed in our community owing to lack of clinical suspicion, failure to biopsy, and histopathological misinterpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Educating clinicians and pathologists before planning an endoscopy may improve the diagnostic sensitivity </plain></SENT>
