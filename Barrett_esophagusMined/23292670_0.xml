<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, extensive data has been published about the safety and efficacy of endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> as well as without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RFA has been shown to be effective and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Circumferential RFA is delivered using the HALO360+ Ablation System (Covidien,Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), which consists of a high-power energy generator, a sizing balloon catheter, and a number of balloon-based ablation catheters with varying outer diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal RFA is delivered using the HALO90 or HALO60 Ablation Systems (Covidien,Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), consisting of a radiofrequency energy generator and an endoscope-mounted electrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both RFA systems have official approval to be used in the United States, Europe, and other countries for the treatment of BE as well as in patients with gastric antral vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and radiation proctopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With increasing widespread use of these systems, a full mastery of the equipment and therapeutic technique is essential to maximize eradication rates of BE while maintaining patient safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cost-effective patient selection and eradication protocol for RFA are essential to success with this technique in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This article will discuss our experience with RFA treatment of BE using the HALO system for effective eradication of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and available data especially from the U.S </plain></SENT>
