<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose is to determine whether a novel cell cycle marker, minichromosome maintenance protein 2 (Mcm2), predicted esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC) risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and whether this could be used in combination with a surface sampling method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Archival specimens [30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus (NE), 20 gastric antrum (GA), 13 duodenum (D2), 62 BE +/- <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 16 (AC)] were stained for Mcm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequential biopsies from nine patients who developed AC during surveillance were compared with 18 matched controls who did not progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prospective endoscopic cytological brushings (61 NE, 90 BE +/- <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 11 AC) were scored as Mcm2 positive or negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mcm2 was not expressed on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface of NE, GA, and D2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In BE, the percentage of surface cells expressing Mcm2 correlated highly with the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients who developed AC, biopsies before <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had higher Mcm2 expression than the matched control patients (mean, 28.4 and 3.4% positive cells, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the prospective cohort, the histopathological diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or AC and the Mcm2-positive brushings were concordant in 91% of the patients (P &lt; 0.005), and the results correlated with the frequency of cases with surface expression of Mcm2 in the retrospective study (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surface expression of Mcm2 can be used to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and AC, as well as patients with BE at risk for subsequent development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A brushing technique combined with Mcm2 staining has the potential to be exploited in surveillance and screening protocols </plain></SENT>
