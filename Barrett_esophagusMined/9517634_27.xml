<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of these islands is not clearly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to systematically biopsy macroscopic squamous islands and to examine their histologic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> undergoing surveillance had squamous islands documented and biopsied at the time of endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was defined as the presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> on endoscopy with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsies were obtained by a single senior endoscopist and were stained with alcian blue at pH 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples with inadequate tissue quantity were not included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 39 biopsies were obtained from 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty of the 22 patients were male, with a mean age of 65.4 yr (range 47-80 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean length of Barrett's mucosa was 5.6 cm (range 1-11 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 22 patients were on <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (mean dose 29.1 mg/day), whereas seven patients were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> (60 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy was 2.3 yr (range 9-71 months) at the time of biopsy of the squamous islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients were on H2-blocker therapy whereas the remaining patient had not been started on acid suppression therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On histology, 24 biopsy specimens (61.5%) revealed only squamous epithelium, whereas 15 (38.5%) showed the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> underlying the squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the patients with and without underlying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in regard to age, Barrett's length, dose, and duration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In more than one-third of biopsies of macroscopic squamous islands within <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, microscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> is detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The presence of squamous islands should not be equated with regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or with decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
