<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intersegmental troughs (ISTs) between striated and smooth muscle contraction segments on high-resolution manometry (HRM) have been linked to hypomotility disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between ISTs, latency of initiation of smooth muscle contraction, and motor patterns in symptomatic patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HRM Clouse plots were analyzed in 199 participants (47.2±1.2 y, 112F/87M), categorized into 110 participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), 74 symptomatic participants without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, and 15 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IST length was measured in centimeters and percentage esophageal length, designated extended when ≥20% esophageal length on &gt;30% swallows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proximal latency was measured as the time interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of skeletal and smooth muscle contraction segments, and designated prolonged when ≥4s in ≥50% of swallows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ISTs of any length were noted in 74.6% swallows and in 92.5% of participants, with a similar frequency across the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ISTs and proximal latency were both longer in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> group, especially when <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> was present, compared with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients or controls (P≤0.03 across groups); extended IST and prolonged proximal latency followed similar trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate logistic regression, extended IST predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> [odds ratio (OR), 2.30; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.18-4.47], as did lower esophageal sphincter pressure &lt;5 mm Hg (OR, 3.79-3.96; 95% CI 1.77-8.49), after controlling for age and sex; prolonged proximal latency predicted both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (OR, 2.03; 95% CI 1.01-4.12) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.24-2.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of IST and proximal latency add value to HRM analysis, and may be markers of esophageal hypomotility </plain></SENT>
