<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a well-known acquired condition resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still unknown whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> develops gradually over time in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we investigated the change in the prevalence and length of short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2005 to March 2007, we enrolled 5338 patients who received upper gastrointestinal endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalence and length of endoscopically identified SSBE were evaluated within groups divided on the basis of 10-year age intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The factors possibly influencing SSBE length such as symptoms, antacid use, and endoscopic findings were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the length change in 236 patients with histologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was evaluated over a 2-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 5338 enrolled patients, 1997 had SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of endoscopically identified SSBE was significantly higher and its length was significantly longer in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed that age, presence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, reflux symptoms, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> were positively correlated with SSBE length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the 2-year follow-up study of histologically confirmed SSBE revealed significant extension of Barrett's length in 28.0% of 236 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Presence of reflux symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> were identified as positive predictors and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> administration as a negative predictor of SSBE elongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Positive predictors for the extension of SSBE were presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and reflux symptoms, but not age </plain></SENT>
