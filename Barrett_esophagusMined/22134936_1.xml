<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From February 1, 2009, to May 31, 2010, patients from Olmsted County, Minnesota, who were older than 50 years and had no history of known BE were randomized (stratified by age, sex, reflux symptoms noted in a validated questionnaire) into 3 groups for esophageal evaluation with sEGD, uTNE, or VCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participation rates and safety profiles were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We contacted 127 patients to recruit 20 for each procedure arm (60 total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of participation was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26%-51%) for sEGD, 50% (95% CI, 35%-65%) for uTNE, and 59% (95% CI, 42%-74%) for VCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both uTNE and VCE were well tolerated without adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BE was identified in 3 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Unsedated techniques may be acceptable, feasible, and safe alternatives to sEGD to screen for BE in the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00943280 </plain></SENT>
