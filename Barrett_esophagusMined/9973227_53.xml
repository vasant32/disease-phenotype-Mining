<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, arising at and around the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), share a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there is no consensus with respect to clinical staging resulting in possible adverse effects on treatment and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to provide more insight into the genetic changes underlying esophageal and gastric cardia <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have used comparative genomic hybridization for a genetic analysis of 28 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the GEJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were localized in the distal esophagus and related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and 10 tumors were situated in the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were located at the junction and could not be classified as either Barrett-related, or gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 28 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gains and losses were distinguished in comparable numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Frequent loss (&gt; or = 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>) was detected, in decreasing order of frequency, on 4pq (54%), 14q (46%), 18q (43%), 5q (36%), 16q (36%), 9p (29%), 17p (29%), and 21q (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Frequent gain (&gt; or = 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>) was observed, in decreasing order of frequency, on 20pq (86%), 8q (79%), 7p (61%), 13q (46%), 12q (39%), 15q (39%), 1q (36%), 3q (32%), 5p (32%), 6p (32%), 19q (32%), Xpq (32%), 17q (29%), and 18p (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were male, and loss of chromosome Y was frequently noted (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrent high-level amplifications (&gt; 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>) were seen at 8q23-24.1, 15q25, 17q12-21, and 19q13.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Minimal overlapping regions could be determined at multiple locations (candidate genes are in parentheses): minimal regions of overlap for deletions were assigned to 3p14 (FHIT, RCA1), 5q14-21 (APC, MCC), 9p21 (MTS1/CDKN2), 14q31-32.1 (TSHR), 16q23, 18q21 (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>, P15) and 21q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Minimal overlapping amplified sites could be seen at 5p14 (MLVI2), 6p12-21.1 (NRASL3), 7p12 (EGFR), 8q23-24.1 (MYC), 12q21.1, 15q25 (IGF1R), 17q12-21 (ERBB2/HER2-neu), 19q13.1 (TGFB1, BCL3, AKT2), 20p12 (PCNA), 20q12-13 (MYBL2, PTPN1), and Xq25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the imbalances revealed similar genetic patterns in the three GEJ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, loss of 14q31-32.1 occurred significantly more frequent in Barrett-related <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the distal esophagus, than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333763" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastric cardia cancers</z:e> (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The unclassified, "pure junction" group displayed an intermediate position, suggesting that these may be in part gastric cardia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, whereas the others may be related to (short-segment) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study has, fist, provided a detailed comparative genomic hybridization-map of GEJ <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> documenting new genetic changes, as well as candidate genes involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Second, genetic divergence was revealed in this poorly understood group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
