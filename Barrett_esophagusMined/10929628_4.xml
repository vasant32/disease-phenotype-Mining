<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the potential of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) for eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Indication for APC was the histologic evidence of columnar epithelium with a length of &gt; or = 2 cm, located proximal of the cardia and with the presence of goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic therapy was performed using an Argonbeamer (Beamer 2, Erbe Company, TÃ¼bingen, Germany) under i.v. sedation and repeated in intervals of 2-3 weeks with the aim of complete eradication of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One month after macroscopic Barrett eradication, superficial and deep biopsies were obtained every 2 cm in 4 quadrant technique to confirm the endoscopic aspect of complete eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report our results (follow-up median: 12 mths., 3-25) in the first 12 patients (8m/4f, median age 57 yrs., 42-69) in which treatment was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one case there was evidence of moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A mean of 5 (4-11) sessions were required for complete Barrett eradication in 11 patients (median size of Barrett-segment: 4 cm, range 2-11), in one patient partial regression of 50% was observed treatment was discontinued after 17 sessions while only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Deep biopsies showed subepithelial columnar epithelium islands in one case, recurrence of Barrett occurred in 2 cases after 3 and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Under APC-treatment, 11/12 patients complained about retrosternal pain and odynophagia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No other complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results indicate that APC is safe and effective to eradicate Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Follow-up in a larger number of patients is necessary to assess longterm results (Barrett recurrence, decrease in the incidence of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>), before APC may generally be recommended </plain></SENT>
