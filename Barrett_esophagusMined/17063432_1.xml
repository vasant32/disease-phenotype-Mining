<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is an accepted base for surveillance strategies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; data on the natural history of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (ERD) are sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a prospective long-term follow-up examination of the course of ERD to confirm the recommendation of a once-in-lifetime endoscopy as a screening programme for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients not older than 60 years with reflux symptoms and a first time diagnosis of ERD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at the time of inclusion were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up by a further upper GI endoscopy after at least 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were interviewed about clinical symptoms and medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-five patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were obtained for 115 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one patients (22 female, 49 male, average age: 48.3 years; range: 22-60 years) remained in the programme, 37 patients died from unrelated diseases within the follow-up period (mostly due to cardiovascluar diseases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were excluded because of missing videoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up period was 78.3 (range: 60-85) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During this time, 76 % of the patients received medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only three patients (4.5 %) showed progression of erosive lesions, whereas two patients developed a short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without intraepithealial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These 5 patients received no medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Progression of ERD is an unlikely event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Once-in-lifetime endoscopy is an adequate screening tool that may serve as a basis for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> surveillance program </plain></SENT>
