<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In a previous report, the authors documented the procedures necessary to regain esophageal continuity in infants who had massive disruption of the suture line following esophagoplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a corollary, this study shows the feasibility of preserving the esophagus in older children by using an esophageal patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen children ranging in age from 8 months to 16 years at the time of surgery had repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> or tracheoesophageal fistulae by the use of a vascularized patch rather than esophageal resection and interposition with colon or stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The technique of "colonic-patch oesophagoplasty" was described by Hecker and Hollman in 1975 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From 1976 to 1995, the authors have used a modification of their procedure in 14 children, and in one patient an intercostal muscle flap was interposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technique consists of esophagotomy through the area of stricture with application of a vascularized patch of colon to the resulting defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten of the patients were boys and four were girls with an additional girl considered for the procedure at 8 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, during surgery, an intercostal muscle flap interposition was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> caused by lye ingestion; two from anastomotic stricture; two from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>; two from recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002575'>tracheoesophageal fistula</z:hpo>; and one from long-term nasogastric intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up showed excellent results in nine patients who had the colic patch operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had good swallowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A tenth patient, the child with the vascularized intercostal muscle flap, is currently eating a regular diet but it has only been 4 months since the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, one of these excellent patients continues to have a small focus of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and another one was killed in an automobile accident one year after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three children have good results but with occasional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">difficulty in swallowing</z:e> boluses of meat or with continuing reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients had poor results and both have undergone reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In one of these children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the colic patch worked well for 6 years but because of continuing reflux, distal esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> and obstruction eventually ensued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>After reoperation for distal esophageal resection and colic interposition, the patient died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948755" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary failure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The second child with poor results has recently undergone reoperation to extend the esophagotomy through the distal scarred esophagus and to revise the colic patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of a vascular colic patch for treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> is a viable alternative to esophageal resection and interposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, patients with continuing reflux or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, or both, may progress with distal esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> and obstruction and subsequent dilation of the patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Those patients will require reoperation </plain></SENT>
