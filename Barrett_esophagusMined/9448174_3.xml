<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several studies suggest that patients with esophageal peptic strictures have a high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these studies did not include appropriate control groups, were retrospective in nature, or did not strictly define <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> strictures in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-nine patients referred for endoscopy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> symptoms were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We collected demographic information and an esophageal symptom assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were obtained from peptic strictures, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267081" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Schatzki rings</z:e>, or from any areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> or mucosal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was strictly defined as the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> from tubular esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 46 patients without strictures and 28 patients with peptic strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267081" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Schatzki's rings</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was 23.9% in patients without strictures, and 25% in patients with peptic strictures (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in prevalence of short- or long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with strictures were older than patients without strictures (mean age 58.9 vs 48.6 yr), and more likely to have mucosal injury (50% vs 26.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, there were no significant differences with regards to gender, race, heartburn duration or frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, as defined by the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the tubular esophagus, is equally common in patients with and without peptic strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There does not appear to be an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and peptic strictures </plain></SENT>
