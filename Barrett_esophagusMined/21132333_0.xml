<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has been divided into three categories based on the extent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>: long-segment (LSBE), short-segment (SSBE), and ultrashort-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (USBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While both LSBE and SSBE are thought to be induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, the etiology of USBE is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to identify the differences in the pathogenesis between SSBE and USBE in a hospital-based population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic findings and clinical factors of 199 patients with short-segment endoscopically suspected esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (SS-ESEM) and 317 patients with ultrashort-segment ESEM (US-ESEM) were compared with those of 199 and 317 age- and gender-matched patients without ESEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The severity of gastric mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was marginally associated with the presence of US-ESEM [odds ratio (OR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-1.46, p = 0.08], but not with that of SS-ESEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> and that of severe reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were associated with the presence of SS-ESEM (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.21-3.98; OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.08-2.75), but not with that of US-ESEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presence of gastric corpus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> was associated with the presence of US-ESEM, but not with that of SS-ESEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Presence of gastric corpus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was associated with an increased likelihood of the presence of US-ESEM, whereas the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> was associated with an increased likelihood of the presence of SS-ESEM, suggesting difference in etiology between US- and SS-ESEM </plain></SENT>
