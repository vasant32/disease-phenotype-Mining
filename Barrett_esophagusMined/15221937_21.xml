<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study has analysed a series of 23 formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded tissue samples of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BCA, n = 18) and non-neoplastic squamous oesophageal (n = 2) and gastric cardia mucosa (n = 3) by aCGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The micro-arrays used contained 287 genomic targets covering oncogenes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor genes, and DNA sequences localized within chromosomal regions previously reported to be altered in BCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence copy number changes for a panel of approximately 50 genes were identified, most of which have not been previously described in BCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence copy number gains (mean 41 +/- 25/BCA) were more frequent than DNA sequence copy number losses (mean 20 +/- 15/BCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest frequencies for DNA sequence copy number gains were detected for SNRPN (61%); GNLY (44%); NME1 (44%); DDX15, ABCB1 (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>), ATM, LAMA3, MYBL2, ZNF217, and TNFRSF6B (39% each); and MSH2, TERC, SERPINE1, AFM137XA11, IGF1R, and PTPN1 (33% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence copy number losses were identified for PDGFB (44%); D17S125 (39%); AKT3 (28%); and RASSFI, FHIT, CDKN2A (p16), and SAS (CDK4) (28% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-neoplastic tissue samples of squamous oesophageal and gastric cardia mucosa, the measured mean ratios were 1.00 (squamous oesophageal mucosa) or 1.01 (gastric mucosa), indicating that no DNA sequence copy number chances were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For validation, the DNA sequence copy number changes of selected clones (SNRPN, CMYC, HER2, ZNF217) detected by aCGH were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data show the sensitivity of aCGH for the identification of DNA sequence copy number changes at high resolution in BCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The newly identified genes may include so far unknown biomarkers in BCA and are therefore a starting point for further studies elucidating their possible role in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
