<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: At Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, Scotland, medical records of 136 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At Wexham Park Hospital, Slough, Southern England, 50 male and 51 female <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients were matched for sex, age, and year of diagnosis (+/- 3 yr) with uncomplicated reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were abstracted for tobacco consumption, alcohol intake, and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Dundee, height was also recorded and body mass index calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alcohol and tobacco intake were scored for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Dundee there is no difference in smoking or drinking habits between men and women under and over 50 yr of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Slough there is little difference in drinking or smoking habits between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients and between their mean weights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, of the Dundee <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients younger than 50 yr, 31% of men and 71% of women have body mass indexes over 30 (<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>), versus 11% and 13%, respectively, for the general population </plain></SENT>
