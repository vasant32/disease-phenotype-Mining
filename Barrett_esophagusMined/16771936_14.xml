<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Although symptoms of reflux are common, our knowledge of the epidemiology and natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> is sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is increased among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, but the contribution of Barrett's lesions is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: With the aim to estimate the incidence of diagnosed endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> lesions and the risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> among patients with previously diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, we extracted data on endoscopies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> diagnoses, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112160" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastroesophageal cancer</z:e> diagnoses from five population-based databases covering the period from 1974 to 2002, and covering <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> citizens in Funen County (population 470,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 2002, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> lesions was 2.4 per 1,000 person-years (95% confidence interval 2.3-2.6), 18.3 per 1,000 persons (17.9-18.7) had previously diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence increased by calendar year and age, was higher among males than among females, and was closely related to rate of endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 11,129 patients with previously diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 15 had esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> during 58,322 person-years of follow-up (26 per 100,000 person-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expected number was 2.79 and the standardized incidence ratio was 5.38 (3.01-8.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 15 patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had previously diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is increased fivefold in patients with previously diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, but most of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> occurred among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
