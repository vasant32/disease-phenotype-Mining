<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic role of the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, in the management of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> originating from HER2-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> of the esophagus after esophageal mucosectomy and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were not eligible for radical surgery or chemo-radiotherapy because of age and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HER2 status was assessed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional immunohistochemical analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The whole panel was analysed at baseline, after treatment and at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the two patients showed HER-2 overexpression/amplification in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> but not in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six months after treatment no significant differences in terms of endoscopical and histological patterns of the disease were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HER-2, EGFR, TOPOII-alpha and anti-ssDNA analysis demonstrated a down-regulation of these markers and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that this treatment is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No clear evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> regression was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, HER2 and TopoII-alpha downregulation and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> occurring 6 months after treatment encourages further investigation </plain></SENT>
