<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our goal was a prospective follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to determine what clinical, endoscopic, and histological features at the time of initial diagnosis are predictive of the development of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or multifocal high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients were prospectively followed with a standardized endoscopic and bioptic surveillance protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Features examined by chi2 and stepwise logistic regression analyses as potential predictors the development of multifocal HGD or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> included age, length of Barrett's segment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> size, severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at diagnosis, severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> during surveillance, and type of long-term medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred-eight Barrett's patients have had follow-up ranging from 12 months to 101 months (mean +/- SD, 39.9+/-20.8 months), for a total of 361.8 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, five patients developed multifocal HGD and five developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> as well as multifocal HGD was 1 per 71.9 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chi2 analysis showed progression to Barrett's multifocal HGD/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (p = 0.02), the length of Barrett's (p = 0.001), the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at diagnoses (p &lt; 0.001) or anytime during surveillance (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed progression to multifocal HGD or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was significantly and independently associated with presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at diagnosis (p &lt; 0.0001) or anytime during follow-up (p &lt; 0.03), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> size (p &lt; 0.02, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> &gt; or =3 cm), and length of Barrett's (p = 0.009, &gt;2 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic and histological features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients at initial diagnosis are predictive of risk of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
