<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the regression rate of BE by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> and predictable markers related to regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five patients diagnosed as BE were consecutively enrolled and most of them took continuous <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 25 patients underwent endoscopic surveillance and received biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) was lost at any point of surveillance and did not recur, the case was regarded as the regression group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of SIM was graded and the mucin phenotype was decided using immunohistochemistry for MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To assess the cell proliferation indexes and the degree of intestinal maturation, immunohistochemistry for Ki67 and CDX2 were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The regression of BE occurred in the 11 (44%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical and demographic factors showed no difference between the regression (n = 11) and persistence group (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lower grade of SIM (P &lt; 0.001) and gastric predominant mucin phenotype (P = 0.018) were more frequent, and the number of Ki67 positive cell per gland (P = 0.008) and the mean extent of CDX2 (P = 0.022) were lower in the regression group than in the persistence group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The regression of BE by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment was frequent in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical detection of mucin phenotype, grade of SIM, Ki67 and CDX2 expression in Barrett's mucosa could be useful as a predictable marker for regression of SIM in BE </plain></SENT>
