<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Racial differences in the prevalence of BE are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to study the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) symptoms, and the differences between these two groups in terms of race, age, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) reports from the PENTAX EndoPRO database for the Endoscopy Unit at the University of Texas Medical Branch from 2005 to 2007 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and ten patients who underwent upper endoscopy because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms that were not responding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) therapy or with alarm symptoms and 4,047 patients undergoing upper endoscopy for other reasons without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE was significantly more common among males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BE was higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms than those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, more cases of BE, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were found among the patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms than those that underwent endoscopy because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BE among Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, and "other" groups with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms were 5%, 2.56%, 4.4%, and 0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BE among these racial groups without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms were 1.9%, 0.9%, 1.57%, and 0.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The association between race and BE was not statistically significant (df = 3, P = 0.2628), including after adjusting for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms (df = 3, P = 0.2947) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms that presented with BE were significantly older than the patients without BE (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BE is a male-dominant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was not significant different among Caucasian, Hispanics, and African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients with BE, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> did not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
