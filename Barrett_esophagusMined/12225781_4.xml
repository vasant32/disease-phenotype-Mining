<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Elevated mortality due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> has been reported for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the prevalence of risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in patients with BE, reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE), and non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> (NUD) with that of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with upper gastrointestinal complaints and BE, RE, or NUD were compared with a matched cohort from the general population using a questionnaire and blood pressure and cholesterol measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> occurred more frequently in patients with BE (odds ratio 5.1, P&lt;0.0001) and RE (odds ratio 3.8, P&lt;0.001), but not in those with NUD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum total cholesterol was higher in BE (P=0.02) and borderline in RE (P=0.06) but not in NUD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels, body mass index, and smoking did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that BE and RE found at diagnostic endoscopy are associated with an increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and a higher total cholesterol level than in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If so, this would explain the increased mortality during the follow-up of BE patients, and it should be taken into account when designing or evaluating follow-up studies of BE </plain></SENT>
