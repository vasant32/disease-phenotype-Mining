<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: There is growing evidence that iron is important in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> whose incidence is rising faster than any other in the Western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, how iron mediates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> at the molecular level remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the expression of iron transport proteins involved in cellular iron import, export, and storage in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Perls' staining was used to examine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> in tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in samples of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> matched with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and samples of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> without evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were examined by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitative immunohistochemistry was used to examine cellular localization and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of iron loading on cellular proliferation and iron transporter expression was determined in esophageal cell lines OE33 and SEG-1 using a bromodeoxyuridine assay and real-time PCR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the progression of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, there was overexpression of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), transferrin receptor 1, duodenal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38551">cytochrome b</z:chebi>, ferroportin, and H-ferritin, and these changes were associated with increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of DMT1 was further associated with metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Iron loading OE33 and SEG-1 cells caused increased cellular proliferation, which was associated with increased H-ferritin and decreased transferrin receptor 1 and DMT1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is associated with increased expression of iron import proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These events culminate in increased intracellular iron and cellular proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may represent a novel mechanism of esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
