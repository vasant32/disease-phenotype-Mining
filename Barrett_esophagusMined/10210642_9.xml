<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: APC and TP53 are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes known to be altered frequently in human esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC), which arises as a complication of reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the functional role of these genes in the development of EAC, we have created reflux in mice gene-targeted for either Trp53 or Apc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> (WT), p53-knockout (Trp53-/-), or Apc-mutated (ApcMin/+) mice were generated in our breeding colony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total gastrectomy with esophagojejunostomy was performed at 6 weeks of age, creating jejunoesophageal reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unoperated control mice were maintained under identical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were sacrificed at 30 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histology of the esophagus and jejunal anastamosis or gastroesophageal junction was reviewed by a single pathologist blinded to the genotype of the animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The esophagus was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the unoperated mice (6 ApcMin/+, 6 WT, and 6 Trp53-/-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operated mice (6 ApcMin/+, 12 WT, and 4 Trp53-/-) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_149'>squamous hyperplasia</z:mpath> and early focal ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was identified in 33% of the operated ApcMin/+ (2/6) and 25% of the Trp53-/- (1/4) mice, but not in the WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 4 operated Trp53-/- mice, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> developed severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the squamous epithelium and 2 (50%) had EAC on histology, although no gross <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was identified in any of the ApcMin/+ or WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Loss of either Trp53 or Apc leads to the development of columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, whereas loss of Trp53, but not Apc, leads to development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in mice with jejunoesophageal reflux </plain></SENT>
