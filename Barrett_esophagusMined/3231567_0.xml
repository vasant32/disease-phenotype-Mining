<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequency of mitotic figures, the proportion of atypical mitoses, and the spatial position (vertical or horizontal) of metaphasal plates were studied in resected specimens from 18 patients having Barrett's mucosa with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and/or invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number of dividing glandular cells increased (by comparison with the non-dysplastic Barrett's mucosa) in areas with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and with invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the largest percentage was found in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Atypical mitoses were often found in areas with <z:mp ids='MP_0002163'>glandular dysplasia</z:mp> and with invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The highest frequency was found in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While 90.8% of the metaphases in Barrett's mucosa without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had a vertical position, only 39.5% of the mitoses in areas with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had the same position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable, that the number of mitoses, the number of atypical mitoses as well as the spatial position of mitosis should be registered in the Barrett's mucosa with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in attempts to learn more about the biological behaviour of these lesions </plain></SENT>
