<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A more widely available, well-tolerated, and cost-effective technique is needed to screen a broad population at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An ideal solution might be to perform unsedated esophagoscopy with an entirely self-contained, small-caliber endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a prospective, blinded study in three phases, we compared the feasibility, patient tolerance, and diagnostic accuracy of esophagoscopy performed with a prototype, superthin, battery-powered esophagoscope (BPE) with standard video esophagogastroduodenoscopy (SVE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In phase I, 10 healthy volunteers underwent both peroral and transnasal esophagoscopy with BPE to evaluate the technical feasibility of the examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For phases II and III, patients were recruited to have BPE before SVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In phase II, both procedures were performed with conscious sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In phase III, the BPE was performed with only topical anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two endoscopists assessed the technical performance of the endoscope and patient tolerance and recorded the esophageal findings independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In phase I, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> endoscopists reported adequate visualization of the esophagus in the 10 volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 181 patients were evaluated in phases II and III (89 in phase II, 92 in phase III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> was 94% in phase II and 95% in phase III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> esophageal findings was 87% and 86% in phases II and III, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The technical performance of the endoscope was significantly worse for BPE compared with the SVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The patient tolerance as evaluated by the endoscopist was similar for both procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five percent of the patients undergoing unsedated BPE were willing to have the procedure repeated under similar circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unsedated esophagoscopy with a 3.1-mm, battery-powered, stand-alone esophagoscope is feasible, well tolerated, and accurate in detecting esophageal pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It might be an efficient and cost-effective screening tool for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
