<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and phenotypic features of CLE and EAC in the rat model and compares them with the corresponding lesions in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Swiss roll preparations of esophagi of EGDA rats and biopsies from human BE containing specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) and EAC were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The esophagi of EGDA rats showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, CLE, islands of multilayered epithelium (MLE), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CLE had features of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MLE frequently occurred at the neo-squamocolumnar junction and occasionally in the mid-esophagus in isolated foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scattered mucinous cells in esophageal squamous epithelium were also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CLE and MLE in EGDA rats resembled the lesions described in human BE in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, mucin features and expression of differentiation markers (CK7, CK20, Das-1, villin, and pS2/TFF1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Invasive EAC in EGDA rat is of well-differentiated mucinous type, which is in contrast to the variably differentiated glandular type of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in human BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>p53, c-myc, and cyclooxygenase 2 are expressed in both the rat and human SIM and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that, not withstanding small differences, SIM and EAC induced in EGDA rats are similar to the corresponding lesions in human BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EGDA rats may serve as a useful model to study the pathogenesis, molecular biology, and chemopreventive interventions of human BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
