<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It had been believed that over 75% of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recently, in Western countries, the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> has decreased, while the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has increased dramatically, accounting for almost 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this change, concern over <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, it was believed that BE affected Asians less frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, accelerated westernization has changed the lifestyle of Asians dramatically, and this raises the question that the prevalence might be changed in Asians living in Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lacking reports on the prevalence of BE in the Korean population, we examined the data from endoscopic examinations performed at five referral hospitals in Seoul, Korea, to estimate the period prevalence of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One thousand five hundred and fifty-three patients who presented themselves to five referral hospitals due to various gastrointestinal symptoms prospectively underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations and were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two biopsy specimens were taken from any parts of pink mucosa 3 cm or more above the squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE was detected in 5 of the 1553 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations, and the approximate period prevalence of BE in Korean patients in the five referral hospitals was 3.2 per 1000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 5 patients, two were men and three women with a mean age of 65 +/- 11.8 (mean +/- SD) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 25 and were not <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regurgitation was described by 2 (40%) patients with BE, and heartburn was complained of by 4 (80%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 5 patients with BE, 3 (60%) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 2 (40%) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and none of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The gross type of BE consisted of type I (spike) in 2 (40%) patients, type II (circumferential type II) in 1 (20%) patient, type III (circumferential type III) in 1 (20%) patient, and mixed type in 1 (20%) patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The period prevalence of BE among the patients of five referral hospitals was 3.2 per 1000, and it seems that the prevalence of BE in Korean urban area is lower than that in Western countries </plain></SENT>
