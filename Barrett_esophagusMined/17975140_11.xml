<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Our aim was to investigate whether and at what stage hypermethylation of the tachykinin-1 (TAC1) gene is associated with human esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TAC1 promoter hypermethylation was examined by real-time methylation-specific PCR in 258 human esophageal specimens and 126 plasma samples from patients or tissues at various stages of neoplastic evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TAC1 hypermethylation in tissue samples showed highly discriminative receiver-operator characteristic curve profiles, clearly distinguishing esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both frequencies and normalized methylation values of TAC1 tissue methylation were significantly higher in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BE), dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, EAC, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of TAC1 hypermethylation increased dramatically and early during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>, from 7.5% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus to 55.6% in BE from patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> alone, 57.5% in dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and 61.2% in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant relationship between TAC1 hypermethylation and BE segment length, a known clinical risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve (50%) of 24 ESCC exhibited TAC1 hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall patient survival correlated significantly with TAC1 methylation status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> patients (mean survival, 22 versus 110 months; P = 0.0102, log-rank test), but not in EAC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both mean normalized methylation values and frequency of TAC1 hypermethylation in plasma samples were significantly higher in EAC patients than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of KYSE220 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> and BIC EAC cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> reduced TAC1 methylation and increased TAC1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TAC1 promoter hypermethylation is a common event in both major histologic types of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo>, occurs early, correlates with other progression risk factors in esophageal adenocarcinogenesis, and is a tissue biomarker of a poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Circulating methylated TAC1 promoter DNA also offers potential as a biomarker for the diagnosis of EAC </plain></SENT>
