<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abdominal CT confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> to the liver and lymph nodes, for which surgical excision and radiotherapy were not indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We started chemotherapy with a course of daily oral S-1 at a dose of 80 mg/m(2) for 21 days, with a 2-hour drip of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> at 60 mg/m(2) on day 8 </plain></SENT>
