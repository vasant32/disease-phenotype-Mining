<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is safe and effective in eradicating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and may reduce rates of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed rates of and risk factors for disease recurrence after successful treatment of BE with RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who completed RFA for dysplastic BE or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IMC), achieved complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (CE-D) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CE-IM), and underwent subsequent endoscopic surveillance at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rates of disease recurrence and progression were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> were compared to determine risk factors for recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-two subjects underwent RFA during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 119 and 112 patients were retained in endoscopic surveillance after CE-D and CE-IM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median observation time was 397 days (range: 54-1,668 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (7% of those with CE-IM) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> after a median of 235 days (range 55-1,124 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progression to IMC (n=1) or EAC (n=2) occurred in three of these eight patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had pre-ablation high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients had recurrence of non-dysplastic BE (n=3), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n=1), and HGD (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During 155 patient-years of observation, recurrence occurred in 5.2%/year, and progression occurred in 1.9%/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No clinical characteristics were associated with disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> who achieved CE-IM, BE recurred in â‰ˆ 5%/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics did not predict recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Subjects undergoing RFA for dysplastic BE should be retained in endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
