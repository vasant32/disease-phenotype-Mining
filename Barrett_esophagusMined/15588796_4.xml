<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the early 1900's, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) was an almost unknown entity with less than 200 cases reported worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently the disease is regarded as almost endemic with as much as 25% of the population in some countries exhibiting signs or symptoms of reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early therapies directed at chemical neutralization (milk drip, antacids) were of modest effect and required constant administration for efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The introduction of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> 2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> in the 1970's dramatically improved the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, but was limited by problems of tachyphylaxis and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The advent of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> class of drugs revolutionized medical care of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, given their efficacy and safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the surgical approach with its pronounced dependence on individual operator skill and its high morbidity and even mortality has fallen into disregard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, modest surgical outcome results as compared to the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> has led to the widespread recognition that pharmacological therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> represents the <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> standard of care and the current consensus is that the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> class of drugs provide the safest and most effective form of therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is apparent based on acid suppression, symptom relief and healing rates, that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> are on a milligram for milligram basis similarly efficacious for the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While a consensus exists in regard to the current management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> there is little agreement as to the management of the associated mucosal metaplastic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At this time there is inadequate understanding of the biological basis of the mucosal transformation and minimal information about the mechanistic regulation of this event and its perpetuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A future consensus thus requires the identification of the appropriate tools to detect Barrett's early, identify the specific molecular markers associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> and establish a definitive therapeutic algorithm </plain></SENT>
