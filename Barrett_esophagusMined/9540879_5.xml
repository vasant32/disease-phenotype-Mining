<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients enrolled to date in a study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had an India ink tattoo placed at the most proximal level of the squamocolumnar junction and were examined endoscopically at 3, 9, 15, 24, and 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen of nineteen patients (94.7%) were judged to have a good to excellent tattoo persistence at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the 19 patients (5.3%) had poor tattoo persistence and was retattooed at the 3-month interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eventually, 15 of the 15 patients (100%) who remained in the study had a good or excellent tattoo persistence at 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no complications related to India ink tattooing including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At follow-up endoscopy, no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, break in the mucosa, or pain were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: India ink tattooing in the esophagus is safe and persistent and may be used as an effective method for longitudinal follow-up of lesions in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
