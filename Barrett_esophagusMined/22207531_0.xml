<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with and without LPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the outpatient computer program of our hospital we randomly enrolled 45 GERD patients with LPR into the first group and another 45 GERD patients without LPR to the second group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records of the patients in both groups were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LPR was confirmed by laryngoscopy, and LPR-related laryngoscopy scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (NERD), erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (ERD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) were diagnosed by endoscopy and histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Various clinical parameters including status of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, topography of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For therapy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> in a dosage of 30 mg BID for at least 8 weeks were given to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with and without LPR were compared according to demographic, clinic, endoscopic and histopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that patients with LPR were younger than the patients without LPR (38.7 ± 10.2 years and 43.8 ± 11.5 years; p = 0.08); however, there was no statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients without LPR showed no gender predilection (55% male) while LPR patients showed male preponderance (71% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In LPR group, 11 patients (24%) had NERD, while 28 (62%) and 6 (13%) patients had ERD and BE, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (60%) patients without LPR were diagnosed as NERD, 15 patients (33%) without LPR had ERD and only 3 patients (6.6%) showed the histological findings of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The patients in LPR group had higher body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was more frequent in the patients with LPR (53%) than in the patients without LPR (24%) (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>LPR patients had longer duration of reflux symptoms than the patients without LPR (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>H. pylori status was not different in both groups but the patients without LPR had more corpus <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> than the patients with LPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Eight weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> treatment was successful in 71% of patients with LPR, and 86% of patients without LPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We concluded that male gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, longer duration of symptoms, high BMI, having ERD and BE seems as risk factors for the occurrence of LPR in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>H. pylori status did not have any effect on the development of LPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Corpus dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> may have a protective role against the development of LPR </plain></SENT>
