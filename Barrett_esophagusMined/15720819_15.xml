<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, Met, has established oncogenic properties; however, its expression and function in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the expression and potential alterations in Met expression in EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Met expression was investigated in surgical specimens of EA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (NE) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Met expression, phosphorylation, and the effect of COX-2 inhibition on expression were examined in EA cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IHC demonstrated intense Met immunoreactivity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (100%) EA and dysplastic BE specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, minimal immunostaining was observed in BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or NE specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Met <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were increased in three EA cell lines, and Met protein was phosphorylated in the absence of serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis found the kinase domain of c-met to be <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three EA cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was identified in two EA cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In COX-2-overexpressing cells, COX-2 inhibition decreased Met expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Met is consistently overexpressed in EA surgical specimens and in three EA cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Met dysregulation occurs early in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future study of Met inhibition as a potential biologic therapy for EA is warranted </plain></SENT>
