<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Glands with glassy cells (GGCs) were recently found in 1.8% of patients showing Barrett's mucosa in esophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar GGCs were more recently detected in a baboon having glandulo-metaplastic esophageal mucosa (GMEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to assess the frequency of baboons with GMEM having GGCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: GGCs were sought in 68 consecutive baboons having GMEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sections were stained with H&amp;E, and with alcian blue (pH 2.5) to detect sialomucins in goblet cells (a marker of Barrett's mucosa in GMEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two out of the 68 baboons with Barrett's mucosa (2.9%) showed GGCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In similarity to humans, the Barrett's mucosa in baboons may show GGCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the significance of GGCs in baboons (and in humans) remains poorly understood, their presence might not be a fortuitous event but may be linked to the molecular events leading to the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's mucosa, a known pre-neoplastic mucosal change in the distal esophagus in humans </plain></SENT>
