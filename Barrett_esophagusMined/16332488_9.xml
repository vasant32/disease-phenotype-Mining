<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study determines the relationship among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal dysmotility</z:e>, esophageal acid exposure, and esophageal mucosal injury in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 827 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (confirmed by ambulatory pH monitoring) were divided into three groups based on the degree of mucosal injury: group A, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 493 patients; group B, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> grades I to III, 273 patients; and group C, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 61 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As mucosal damage progressed from no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, there was a significant decrease in lower esophageal sphincter pressure and amplitude of peristalsis in the distal esophagus, with a subsequent increase in the number of reflux episodes in 24 hours, the number of reflux episodes longer than 5 minutes, and the reflux score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, worsening of esophageal mucosal injury may determine progressive deterioration of esophageal motor function with impairment of acid clearance and increase of esophageal acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is an end-stage form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, and that if surgical therapy is performed early in the course of the disease, this cascade of events might be blocked </plain></SENT>
