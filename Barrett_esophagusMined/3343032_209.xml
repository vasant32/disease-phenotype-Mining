<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The potential value of biopsy surveillance of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is diminished by a lack of agreement on the diagnostic criteria for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a preliminary consensus conference, experienced gastrointestinal pathologists from four medical centers agreed on criteria for a five-tiered histologic classification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>--negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight morphologists in the four centers tested the criteria for interobserver agreement by examining a set of coded slides that had been chosen to include some especially difficult interpretative problems in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five histologic classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement of 85 and 87% was achieved in successive reviews when the combined group of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was compared with the combined group of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of other groups yielded less agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example, negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> could be distinguished from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other diagnoses with an interobserver agreement of 72% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that experienced gastrointestinal morphologists can diagnose high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with a high degree of agreement and thus can detect those patients who may need immediate rebiopsy or esophageal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Either further refinement of histologic criteria or alternate diagnostic methods will be needed to achieve the reproducible diagnosis of indefinite changes and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is important because patients with such changes theoretically merit closer endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
