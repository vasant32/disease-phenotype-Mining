<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cigarette use is associated with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and cross-sectional studies suggest an association between smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We sought to examine prospectively the effect of smoking on the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study among 20,863 women within the Nurses' Health Study who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for any reason between 1980 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the association between smoking and pathologically-confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 377) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Self-reported data on smoking and potential confounding variables were collected from biennial questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with women who never smoked, former smokers of 1-24 cigarettes/day had a multivariate odds ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of 1.25 (95% CI 0.99-1.59), former smokers of ≥ 25 cigarettes/day had a multivariate odds ratio of 1.52 (95% CI 1.04-2.22), current smokers of 1-24 cigarettes/day had a multivariate odds ratio of 0.89 (95% CI 0.54-1.45), and current smokers of ≥ 25 cigarettes/day had a multivariate odds ratio of 0.92 (95% CI 0.34-2.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> increased significantly with increasing pack-years smoked among former (P = 0.008) but not current smokers (P = 0.99), especially when considering exposure ≥ 25 years before index endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were similar among women reporting regular heartburn/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid-reflux</z:e> one or more times a week, and were not accounted for by changes in weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Heavy, remote smoking is associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests a long latency period between exposure and development of the disease, even after discontinuation of smoking </plain></SENT>
