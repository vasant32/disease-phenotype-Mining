<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> might decrease <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk by affecting cell proliferation in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> on epithelial cell proliferation in BE was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients with long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> were treated in a randomized 2-year follow-up study with either <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 40 mg b.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(OME) or <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> 150 mg b.i.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(RAN) and were compared for the effect on epithelial cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were taken 3 cm above the GE junction and just below the Z-line, at 0, 3, 9, and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Epithelial cell proliferation was determined by in vitro labeling with 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2-deoxyuridine and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Labeling indices (LI) were established for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> and crypt epithelium separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH-metry was performed at 0 and 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made for the timeframes 0-3 months, 3-24 months, and 0-24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OME reduced mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> to 0.1 %/24 h, RAN to 9.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the distal and the proximal biopsies, change in LI after 3 months was n.s. at either level for both treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the distal biopsies (OME 22, RAN 23 patients) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> LI increased significantly for RAN from 3 to 24 months (+12.64% month, mean area under the curve (AUC)), while that for OME remained stable, RAN versus OME P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Crypt LI increased in both groups, only in RAN significantly so (+30.75% month), RAN versus OME n.s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the proximal biopsies <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> LI at 24 months (OME 20, RAN 21 patients) had increased slightly but not significantly in RAN (+8.86% month), RAN versus OME n.s., whereas in the crypts LI in OME it had increased significantly (+28.80% month), OME versus RAN n.s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> resulted in a stabilization of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> cell proliferative activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1258085" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barrett epithelium</z:e> in the distal esophagus, whereas this activity increased during continued <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Whether this finding has any implication for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> remains to be seen </plain></SENT>
