<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Caudal-type homeobox proteins CDX1 and CDX2 are transcription factors that regulate genes involved in intestinal epithelial differentiation and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrant expression of both ASBT and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDXs</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) prompted us to study, whether the expression of the ASBT gene is regulated by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDXs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Short interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-mediated knockdown of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDXs</z:chebi> resulted in reduced ASBT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in intestinal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDXs</z:chebi> strongly induced the activity of the ASBT promoter in reporter assays in esophageal and intestinal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi> binding sites were predicted in silico within the ASBT promoter, and binding of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDXs</z:chebi> to six of them was verified in vitro and within living cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were extracted from esophageal biopsies from 20 BE patients and analyzed by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlation with ASBT expression was found for CDX1, CDX2, and HNF-1Î± in BE biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the human ASBT promoter is activated transcriptionally by CDX1 and CDX2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our finding provides a possible explanation for the reported observation that ASBT is aberrantly expressed in esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> that also expresses <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi> transcription factors </plain></SENT>
