<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the effect of 40 mg twice daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> (high-dose) on gastric and oesophageal pH and symptoms, and biomarkers relevant to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients, treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> as prescribed by their treating doctor, had their therapy increased to high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At entry into the study, 9/18 patients had excessive 24-h oesophageal acid exposure, and gastric pH remained &lt;4 for &gt;16 h in 8/18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi>, excessive acid exposure occurred in 2/18 patients, and gastric pH &lt;4 was decreased from 38% of overall recording time and 53% of the nocturnal period to 15% and 17%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a reduction in self-assessed symptoms of heartburn (P = 0.0005) and regurgitation (P &lt; 0.0001), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and proliferation in the Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in p53, MGMT or COX-2 expression, or in aberrant DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">esomeprazole</z:chebi> achieved higher levels of gastric acid suppression and control of oesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> and symptoms, with significant decreases in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and epithelial proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no reversal of aberrant DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
