<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the long-term course of conservatively managed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> without H2-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Design: Clinical trial, uncontrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Setting: Gastroenterological outpatient department of a teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients: Sixty of 87 patients consecutively referred for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms and with objectively proven pathological reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements: Esophagoscopy, esophagography, cinecardiography of cardiac region, standard reflux test, and confirmatory Bernstein-Baker test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up included a standardized interview, esophagoscopy with biopsy, and 24-h pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At follow-up 17-22 yr after referral, symptoms were less than at the time of referral in 36 of the 50 nonoperated patients (six now symptom-free), were unchanged in five, and were worse in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Medication for reflux symptoms was no longer used by 34 of the nonoperated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> fell from 40% at referral to 27% at follow-up endoscopy; 42% of the studied patients had pathological 24-h pH, and the endoscopies revealed six new cases of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 41 nonoperated patients examined with both endoscopy and 24-h pH, 27 (66%) had erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and/or pathological pH values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 operated patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had fewer symptoms at follow-up than they had at referral (nine were symptom-free) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> fell from 60% at referral to 10% at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One of the 10 patients had pathological 24-h pH at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neither the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> nor the severity of symptoms at the time of referral predicted the course of the disease of the conservatively treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The severity of the symptoms declines in the long term, but pathological reflux persists in most of the conservatively treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, the reflux itself is not self-limiting, and therapy should be designed with this in mind </plain></SENT>
