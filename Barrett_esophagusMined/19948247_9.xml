<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the impact of depth of submucosal invasion on the presence of metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and survival in patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pathology reports of esophagectomy samples collected from 1997 to 2007 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens from patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and submucosal invasion were reviewed and classified as superficial (upper 1 third, sm1) or deep (middle third, sm2 or deepest third, sm3) invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes studied were presence of metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variables of interest were analyzed as factors that affect overall and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free survival using Cox proportional hazards modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate model was constructed to establish independent associations with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 80 patients; 31 (39%) had sm1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, 23 (29%) had sm2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and 26 (33%) had sm3 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Superficial and deep submucosal invasion were associated with substantial rates of metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> (12.9% and 20.4%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 40.5 +/- 4 months and the mean overall unadjusted survival time was 53.8 +/- 4.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors significantly associated with reduced survival time included the presence of metastatic lymph nodes (hazard ratio [HR], 2.89; confidence interval [CI], 1.13-6.88) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> recurrence (HR 6.39, CI 2.40-16.14), but not depth of submucosal invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sm1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> have substantial rates of metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic treatment of superficial submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is not advised for patients that are candidates for surgery </plain></SENT>
