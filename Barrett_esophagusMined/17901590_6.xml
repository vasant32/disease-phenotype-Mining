<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies demonstrated that inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme-A</z:chebi> reductase (HMG-CoAR), called "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>", independently of their well known plasma cholesterol lowering effect, exert favourable influence on a diverse range of physiologic processes including endothelial function, oxidant stress and antitumor effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of epidemiological studies demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may have protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in the prevention and therapy of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BA) has not been investigated so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyze: 1) the impact of HMG-CoAR inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, on human BA cell growth and 2) effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> related proteins Bax/Bcl-2 and cyclooxygenase-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BA cells (OE-19 cells) were incubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (1-30 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay was used to determine the antiproliferative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of COX-2, Bax and Bcl-2 was analyzed at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein level by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay demonstrated a significant dose-dependent inhibition of OE-19 cell growth by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, which also caused a significant reduction in Bcl-2 expression and an increase in Bax expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In OE-19 cells, the COX-2 expression was detected and significantly increased by the addition of TNFalpha into the medium, however, this effect was significantly attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro data demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> possess anticancerogenic properties possibly due to the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and inhibition of COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical trial are necessary to prove the beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on cancerogenesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
