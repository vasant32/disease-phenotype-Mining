<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Environmental factors seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of BE, especially in Western society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A multicenter case-control study was carried out between February 1995 and April 1999 in 8 Italian Departments of Gastroenterology gathered in a study group (GOSPE), in order to analyze the influence of some individual characteristics and life-style habits on the occurrence of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three groups of patients were studied: 149 patients with BE, 143 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (E) and 308 hospital controls (C) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, non-neoplastic, non-gastroenterological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of BE was based on endoscopy and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>E was defined by the Savary classification (grade I-III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data collection was performed by using a questionnaire that focused on smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption, medical history, drugs history, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation) and socio-economic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the frequency of weekly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms was significantly associated with both BE and E (p&lt;0.0001), such as the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (p&lt; or =0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>Ulcer</z:mpath> was significantly associated with BE (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients with E, the risk was directly related to spirits consumption (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms that lasted more than 13 years were more likely to have BE than E (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, results from our study point out that long-standing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and possibly alcohol consumption are risk factors in the development of the BE and E </plain></SENT>
