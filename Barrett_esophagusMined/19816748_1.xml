<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The ability to eliminate BE is appealing, given the neoplastic potential of this condition and the continued increase in incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> involving the esophagus and esophagogastric junction, a highly lethal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While a number of endoscopic technologies targeting metaplastic or neoplastic esophageal mucosa have been introduced into the clinical marketplace, most have not been widely adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation recently was developed and holds appeal as a reliable, minimally invasive, inexpensive, and well-tolerated technique to destroy pathologic esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The available data show its efficacy and safety in the short-term, though more mature follow-up is needed to demonstrate its durability in the long-term and its cost-effectiveness in ultimately saving lives </plain></SENT>
