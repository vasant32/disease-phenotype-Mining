<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed an epidemiologic study to determine if there whether prior type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>) is associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a population-based case-control study using the General Practice Research Database (GPRD), a United Kingdom primary care database that contains information from more than 8 million subjects, to identify cases of BE (using previously validated codes; n=14,245) and matched controls without BE (by age, sex, enrollment date, duration of follow up, and practice region, by incidence density sampling; n=70,361) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the association of a prior diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> with BE, using conditional univariate and multivariable regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confounders assessed included smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> measured by BMI, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE cases were more likely than controls to have smoked (52.4% vs 49.9%), have a higher mean BMI (27.2 vs 26.9), and a higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> than controls (5.8% vs 5.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariable analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> was associated with a 49% increase in the risk of BE, independent of other known risk factors (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association was stronger in women than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results remained stable with sensitivity analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large population based case-control study, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> was a risk factor for BE, independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (as measured by BMI) and other risk factors (smoking and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that metabolic pathways related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> should be explored in BE pathogenesis and esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
