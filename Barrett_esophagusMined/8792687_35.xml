<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This report presents clinical results of photodynamic therapy for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were treated with photodynamic therapy, and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> porfimer 2.0 mg/kg was used as the photosensitizing drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients also had 15 superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> (0-1.5 cm; ultrasound-T2,N-0,M-0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Red light (630 nm) was delivered to the esophageal mucosa by a diffuser inserted through the endoscope or via a windowed esophageal centering balloon designed to improve targeted delivery of light during photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were maintained on <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> and were followed for 6-62 months after photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Photodynamic therapy produced extensive mucosal damage in treated areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ablation of dysplastic or malignant mucosa was followed by healing and conversion of approximately 75-80% of treated Barrett's mucosa to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete elimination of Barrett's epithelium was achieved in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were eliminated in 29 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 malignancies were ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> was found in follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Healing was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> (four were severe) that were treated successfully by <z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>esophageal dilation</z:mp> in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Photodynamic therapy combined with long-term acid inhibition provides effective endoscopic therapy that 1) eliminates Barrett's mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, and 2) reduces the amount of, or, in some cases, eliminates Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
