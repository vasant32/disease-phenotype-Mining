<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, an International Consensus Group developed a global definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (The Montreal Definition): a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The traditional endoscopy-based classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients into one of three groups - non-erosive reflux disease, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> - is fraught with several limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to the lack of a gold standard, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is a symptom-based diagnosis, and hence symptom evaluation will remain the primary means by which treatment decisions are made for patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose that patients reporting the predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-like symptoms (GERS) in the primary care setting be classified based upon their response to an empiric trial of acid suppressive therapy: complete response to acid suppressive therapy, partial response to acid suppressive therapy, and no response to acid suppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given the limitations of objective medical testing, implementation of our proposed new symptom-based classification of patients with GERS would guide primary care physicians on when to refer patients to a gastroenterologist, which in turn could help in better resource utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Validation of this proposed classification by well-designed prospective multicenter studies is awaited </plain></SENT>
