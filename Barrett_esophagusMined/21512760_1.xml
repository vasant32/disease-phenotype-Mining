<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reflux-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> (RLD), where predominant epigastric pain is associated with heartburn and/or regurgitation, is a common clinical syndrome in both primary and specialty care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because symptom frequency and severity vary, overlap among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), and RLD, is quite common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and recurrent nature of RLD and its variable response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) therapy remain problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, NERD, and RLD in a community setting using an algorithmic approach and to assess the potential, reproducibility, and validity of a multi-factorial scoring system in discriminating patients with RLD from those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> or NERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a novel algorithmic approach, we evaluated an outpatient, community-based cohort referred to a gastroenterologist because of epigastric pain and heartburn that were only partially relieved by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After an initial symptom evaluation (for epigastric pain, heartburn, regurgitation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>), an endoscopy and distal esophageal biopsies were performed, followed by esophageal motility and 24-h ambulatory pH monitoring to assess esophageal function and pathological acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A scoring system based on presence of symptoms and severity of findings was devised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data was collected in two stages: subjects in the first stage were designated as the derivation cohort; subjects in the second stage were labeled the validation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total cohort comprised 159 patients (59 males, 100 females; mean age 52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On endoscopy, 30 patients (19%) had complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (CE) and 11 (7%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and were classified collectively as patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One-hundred and eighteen (74%) patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of these, 94 (59%) had one or more of the following: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, positive biopsy, abnormal pH, and/or abnormal motility studies and were classified as patients with NERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining 24 patients (15%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> functional studies and were classified as patients with RLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Utilizing the scoring system a total score was calculated for each patient and effectively distinguished patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (mean score 9), NERD (mean score 6), and RLD (mean score 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed the optimization of the model, particularly in RLD (P = 0.0001, 95% CI: 0.91-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a community cohort of patients presenting with heartburn and epigastric pain partly refractory to empiric <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy, the prevalence of CE was 19%, BE 7%, NERD 59%, and RLD 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>An algorithmic approach coupled with a novel scoring system, effectively distinguishes <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> from NERD and RLD and facilitates further management decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This novel and simple scoring system is both reproducible and validated as a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="33295">diagnostic aid</z:chebi> in evaluating patients presenting with both epigastric pain and heartburn </plain></SENT>
