<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the magnitude and determinants of an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and of the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE search between 1966 and October 2004 for published full studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: Studies that provided risk estimates and met criteria on defining exposure and reporting outcomes and sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently performed standardized search and data abstraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for individual outcomes were obtained or calculated for each study and were pooled by using a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DATA SYNTHESIS: Nine studies examined the association of body mass index (BMI) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of these studies found statistically significant associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six of 7 studies found significant associations of BMI with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 6 of 7 found significant associations with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and 4 of 6 found significant associations with gastric cardia <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In data from 8 studies, there was a trend toward a dose-response relationship with an increase in the pooled adjusted odds ratios for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.158 to 1.774) for BMI of 25 kg/m2 to 30 kg/m2 and 1.94 (CI, 1.468 to 2.566) for BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the pooled adjusted odds ratios for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> for BMI of 25 kg/m2 to 30 kg/m2 and BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 were 1.52 (CI, 1.147 to 2.009) and 2.78 (CI, 1.850 to 4.164), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the findings was present, although it was mostly in the magnitude of statistically significant positive associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No studies in this review examined the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The risk for these disorders seems to progressively increase with increasing weight </plain></SENT>
