<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Comprehensive understanding of the basic mechanisms in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) is urgently needed to develop a management strategy for an effective screening of BE and management of EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to provide a detailed insight of the histology and the cellular and molecular events associated with the genesis of BE and EAC under the esophagoduodenal reflux conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Esophagoduodenal anastomosis (EDA) was performed on rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were weighed weekly and killed after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The entire esophagi were examined for macroscopic and microscopic changes and for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (MnSOD) expression, and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling) assay was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Morphological transformation from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (100% of animals) to BE (66% of animals) to EAC was observed after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was marked loss of MnSOD expression in animals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and BE at 1 and 2 months, with an increase in expression during the transformation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed and reached a peak at months 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Greatly increased levels of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine was found during the progression to EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The morphological transformation of the esophageal mucosa is an adaptive process, and it is an important foundation for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_85'>transdifferentiation</z:mpath> of BE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The significant loss of MnSOD expression to achieve BE and then the adaptive increase in expression to achieve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EAC during this transformation may represent a predictive marker in identifying patients who will progress from BE to EAC </plain></SENT>
