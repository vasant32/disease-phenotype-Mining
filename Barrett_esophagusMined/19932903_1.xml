<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) is the fastest growing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in terms of incidence and has a high mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animal model to study EAC uses esophagoduodenal anastomosis (EDA) to induce mixed-reflux (bile/acid) causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and EAC sequence within 6 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of fully functional stomach in these rats leads to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have assessed the ability of a chemically pure, purified ingredient diet (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIN</z:e>-93M) to reduce surgery-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> in rats that have undergone the EDA-surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were either sham- (SH) or EDA-operated and fed either a grain-based rodent diet (RD) (SH-RD, n=3; EDA-RD, n=10) or a purified diet (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) (SH-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, n=4; EDA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were weighed periodically for assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and euthanized at the end of 24 wk to measure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumor</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Animals that underwent sham surgery continued to gain weight throughout the study period and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EDA-operated animals had significantly lower <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> compared with sham animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> among EDA animals fed two different types of diets until 9 wk after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 9 wk, EDA-RD continued to lose weight significantly, whereas the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> leveled in EDA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At termination, neither tissue histopathology nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> incidence was significantly different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results show that compared with a natural ingredient diet, a purified ingredient diet can reduce surgery-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in rats with a compromised alimentary tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> has the potential to reduce the confounding effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> on future animal studies reported </plain></SENT>
