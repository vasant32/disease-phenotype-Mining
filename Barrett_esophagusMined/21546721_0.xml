<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to assess this role in patients with non-complicated BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From October 2004 to October 2009, 43 patients with BE (32 men and 11 women) underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication surgery in the Department of Surgery at Minia University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age of these patients was 46 years (range: 22-68 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e>, or previous antireflux surgery were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 43 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heartburn was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, regurgitation in 41 (95.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in 8 (18.6%), retrosternal pain in 30 (69.8%), upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal hemorrhage</z:hpo> in 6 (13.9%), and respiratory symptoms in 19 (44.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nissen fundoplication was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients (79.1%) had concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and nine patients (20.9%) had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 25.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was significant improvement of symptoms after surgery (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight (18.6%) of those with short-segment BE had total regression and four (9.3%) of those with long-segment BE had a decrease in total length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the nine patients with preoperative low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> disappeared in seven, remained unchanged in one, and progressed to in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: laparoscopic fundoplication succeeded in controlling symptoms but had unpredictable effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and regression of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic fundoplication does not eliminate the risk of developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and therefore, endoscopic follow-up should be continued in these patients </plain></SENT>
