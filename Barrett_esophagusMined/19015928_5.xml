<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is poorly understood, but it has been suggested that cardiac mucosa is a precursor of intestinal type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of cardiac mucosa may play a role in the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to examine the presence and distribution of immune-inflammatory cells in cardiac mucosa, specifically focusing on dendritic cells because of their importance as regulators of immune reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Endoscopic biopsy specimens were obtained from 12 patients with cardiac mucosa without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and from 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to histology, in nine of the 21 specimens with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, areas of mucosa composed of cardiac type epithelium-lined glands were present as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy were used to examine immune-inflammatory cells in paraffin-embedded sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immune-inflammatory cells, including T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and mast cells, were present in the connective tissue matrix that surrounded cardiac type epithelium-lined glands in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with cardiac mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clustering of dendritic cells with each other and with lymphocytes and the intrusion of dendritic cells between glandular mucus cells were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> specimens that contained cardiac type glands, computerized CD83 expression quantitation revealed that there were more dendritic cells in cardiac mucosa than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Immune-inflammatory infiltrates containing dendritic cells are consistently present in cardiac mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The finding of a larger number of dendritic cells in areas of cardiac mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> biopsies suggests that the immune <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of cardiac mucosa might play a role in modifying the local tissue environment to promote the development of specialized intestinal type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
