<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is also found in atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005231'>chronic gastritis</z:hpo> and, to a lesser extent, if it has <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, as well as in some <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stomachs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not found in a histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> duodenum, nor in the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the fact that there was no publication on BE drew our attention, we set to make a retrospective research of CP of spinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of distal oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its presence proved to be high, 88% even in those cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> of Barrett </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have used Gram coloration and Warthin Starry with Alcian-Blue and we have classified it within the degrees set by Marshall and Warren </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have also carried out a discussion on certain physiopathological facts, such as the presence of infiltrated PMN in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases, and its importance in keeping <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> of Barrett and its possible role in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
