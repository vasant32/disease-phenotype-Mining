<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this issue, Gough et al. studied the prevalence of polymorphisms of cytokine genes in patients with uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> versus Barrett's/esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They reported a difference between the groups with respect to the interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and interleukin-10 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the number of comparisons carried out mean that the association is not statistically significant and further studies will be required to confirm/refute the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genetic markers reported would unfortunately be of little value in predicting individual risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> as they are weak predictors and relatively rare within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study demonstrate the general principle that polymorphisms of individual genes are of limited value in identifying patients at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>-types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> such as most cases of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
