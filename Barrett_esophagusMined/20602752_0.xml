<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression patterns of GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> have been studied in several <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and its down-regulation was implicated to be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, neither the exact role of GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> in the pathogenesis nor its prognostic impact in squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> is fully characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> expression on 153 archival squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> specimens with a GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistic analyses were performed to explore its association with clinicopathological factors and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> expression was greatly reduced in tissues of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> compared to adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and residual benign tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Absent of GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> protein expression in cytoplasm, nuclear and cytoplasm/nucleus was found in 51%, 64.7% and 48% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> deficiency in cytoplasm, nucleus and cytoplasm/nucleus was significantly correlated to poor differentiation (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>UICC stage and T stage were found significantly correlated to negative expression of GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> in cytoplasm (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively) and cytoplasm/nucleus (p = 0.017 and p = 0.031, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, absent of GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> protein expression in cytoplasm, nucleus and cytoplasm/nucleus was significantly associated with a shorter overall survival (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively), whereas only GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> cytoplasmic staining retained an independent prognostic significance (p &lt; 0.001) in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> expression is down regulated in the squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo>, and that the lack of GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> expression is associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, deficiency of GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> protein expression may be an important mechanism involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and progression of the squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo>, and the underlying mechanisms leading to decreased GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> expression deserve further investigation </plain></SENT>
