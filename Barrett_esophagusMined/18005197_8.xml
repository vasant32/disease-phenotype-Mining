<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that downregulation of the Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1) might be involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the DNA methylation status of the WIF-1 promoter in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, preneoplastic, and neoplastic samples from BE patients and in EAC cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of WIF-1 on EAC cell growth and the chemosensitization of the cells to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that silencing of WIF-1 correlated with promoter hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EAC tissue samples showed higher levels of WIF-1 methylation compared to the matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that WIF-1 hypermethylation was more frequent in BE samples from patients with EAC than in BE samples from patients who had not progressed to EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Restoration of WIF-1 in cell lines where WIF-1 was methylation-silenced resulted in growth suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restoration of WIF-1 could sensitize the EAC cells to the chemotherapy drug <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that silencing of WIF-1 through promoter hypermethylation is an early and common event in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Restoring functional WIF-1 might be used as a new targeted therapy for the treatment of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
