<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to establish the ability to detect nuclear accumulation of altered p53 protein in esophageal brushings as well as biopsies, and to examine for p53 alterations in a group of 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> enrolled in a surveillance and endoscopy program, p53 protein accumulation was easily detected in esophageal brushings, and the results correlated well with matched biopsies (9/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients enrolled in surveillance endoscopy, 1 brushing of 22 was positive for p53 protein accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this patient, who received preoperative radiation and chemotherapy, the positive p53 result correlated with positive cytology for residual <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
