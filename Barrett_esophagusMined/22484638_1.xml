<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> has been suggested to possess anti-neoplastic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) represent a neoplastic series, we postulated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> supplementation may slow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> at this site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> in vitro and in vivo on markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the in vitro ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> to prevent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>-induced DNA damage using micronucleus assay and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activity in the oesophageal cell lines (OE33) using real-time PCR of the extracted <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also analysed NF-κB p65 activation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-pre-treated OE33 cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (DCA) using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another pilot study, BO patients took a daily 500 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> tablet for 7 days prior to their endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In biopsies collected from these patients (n=33, 16 curcumin, 17 control), we examined NF-κB-driven gene expression (interleukin (IL)-8, inhibitor- kappaB (I-κB)) using real-time PCR of the extracted <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from the biopsy sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic frequency was assessed by counting the number of apoptotic bodies in the epithelial cells from the Barrett's tissue with and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> (50 μM) significantly abrogated DNA damage and NF-κB activity induced by bile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreating OE33 cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> (50 μM) completely abolished the ability of DCA (300 μM) to activate NF-κB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vivo, IL-8 expression was non-significantly suppressed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-supplemented patients compared to the squamous control tissue, whilst also showing a doubling in the apoptotic frequency compared to non-supplemented control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> abrogated bile-driven effects in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The in vivo data also suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> supplementation had beneficial effects (<z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp>, potentially reduced NF-κB activity) in the Barrett's tissues themselves, despite poor delivery of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> to the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
