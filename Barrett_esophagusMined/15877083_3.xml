<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adenoviral gene therapy could potentially be used for treatment of patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to study the feasibility of this approach it is important to study adenoviral intestinal transduction both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used differentiating Caco-2 cells, closed intestinal loops and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> rat model to test transduction of adenoviruses expressing green fluorescent protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed a decreased adenoviral transduction from 18.6 to 2.3% in undifferentiated and differentiated Caco-2 cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This could be improved by the use of the mucolytic agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> (NAC) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53323">polycation</z:chebi> diethylaminoethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>), which improved transduction in differentiated cells five- and ten-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also an RGD-retargeted adenovirus showed an improved transduction in differentiated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In closed intestinal loops adenoviral transduction was limited and the use of NAC and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> or RGD targeting had little effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> rat model consisted of an esophagojejunostomy, which results in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumors</z:e> within 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adenoviral transduction in this model was limited and mainly localized in the basal layer of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus and stromal tissue of a Barrett's segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that although the adenovirus shows promising results in vitro, the current adenoviral vectors are probably not suitable for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
