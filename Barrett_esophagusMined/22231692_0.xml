<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients may be unwilling to participate in clinical trials if they perceive risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were evaluated following surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> in patients recruited to randomized trials compared with patients not in trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study compared outcomes of patients who had surgery for reflux within or outside randomized trials between 1994 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The choice of procedure outside each trial was according to surgeon or patient preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were determined 1 and 5 years after surgery using a standardized questionnaire, with analogue scales to assess heartburn, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and overall satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis was undertaken for those aged less than 75 years undergoing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some 417 patients entered six randomized trials evaluating surgery for reflux and 981 underwent surgery outside the trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The trial group contained a higher proportion of men and younger patients, and patients in trials were more likely to have undergone Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, patients in the trials had slightly lower heartburn scores and less abdominal <z:mp ids='MP_0009247'>bloating</z:mp>, but otherwise similar outcomes to those not in the trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 5 years there were no differences, except for a slightly higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> score for liquids in the trial group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the subgroup analysis, demographic data were similar for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no differences at 1 year, but at 5 years patients enrolled in the trials had higher scores for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> for liquids and heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the statistically significant differences were thought unlikely to be clinically relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Participation in a randomized trial assessing surgery for reflux did not influence outcomes </plain></SENT>
