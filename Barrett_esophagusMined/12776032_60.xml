<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is no study of circumferential EMR in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> containing early stage malignant lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the effectiveness and safety of circumferential EMR by using a simple snare technique without cap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> containing multifocal high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and patients with endoscopically nonidentifiable early stage malignant mucosal changes incidentally detected in random biopsy specimens were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 30 x 50-mm polypectomy snare made of monofilament 0.4-mm steel wire was used without any additional device or submucosal injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (10 men, 2 women; median age 63.5 years, range 43-88 years) underwent circumferential EMR; 5 had multifocal lesions, and 7 had no visible lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Segments of Barrett's epithelium were circumferential (median length 5 cm) and completely removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median number of EMR sessions was 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median number of snare resections per EMR session was 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The medial total area of mucosa in resected specimens per session was 3.8 cm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed strictures that were successfully treated by bougienage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred during 4 of 31 EMR sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 9 months, no recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Circumferential EMR with a simple snare technique is feasible, safe, and effective for complete removal of Barrett's epithelium with early stage malignant changes </plain></SENT>
