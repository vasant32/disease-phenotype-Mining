<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This rate is different in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the clinical and laboratory findings in 104 patients with postoperative recurrent reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, determining the results of repeat antireflux surgery or an acid suppression-bile diversion procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeat fundoplication was performed in 26 patients, and truncal vagotomy, antrectomy, and Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy in 78 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy as a third operation was performed in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After repeat antireflux surgery, endoscopic evaluation demonstrated improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in a small proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> remained unchanged, and no regression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> or stricture was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These complications improved significantly after acid suppression-bile diversion surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incompetent lower esophageal sphincter (LES) was present in 55.8% after initial surgery and in 23% after reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">Acid reflux</z:e>, initially present in 94.6% of patients, was also observed in 93.6% after fundoplication, 68.8% after redo fundoplication, and 16.6% after treatment with the acid suppression-bile diversion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A positive Bilitec test was present in 78% of patients before the operation and 56.6% after the repeat operation, and was negative after bile diversion surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among 13 patients (50%) submitted to repeat surgery alone, esophagectomy as a third operation was necessary as a result of severe non-dilatable stricture in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our conclusions are that repeat antireflux surgery alone failed to improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> complications and that the best results were obtained in patients submitted to acid suppression-bile diversion surgery </plain></SENT>
