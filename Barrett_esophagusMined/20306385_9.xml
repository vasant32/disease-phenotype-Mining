<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Staging results have a strong impact on the decision as to whether a patient should undergo endoscopic treatment, surgery alone, or neoadjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was conducted to analyze the accuracy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> staging using EUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who received EUS for staging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> before esophagectomy from February 2003 to December 2007 at a high volume academic tertiary care center were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 179 consecutive patients (mean age 64.4 +/- 9.5 years; 142 men) underwent esophageal resection for Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 134) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137,C0751688" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous cell cancer</z:e> (n = 45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, 99 patients were staged as having T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (55 %), 30 patients T2 (17%), 46 patients T3 (26%), and four patients T4 (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of EUS relative to the T stage were 82% and 91%, respectively, for T1; 43% and 85% for T2; and 83% and 86% for T3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall accuracy for EUS in identifying the correct T stage was 74% (95%CI 66-80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positive lymph nodes were diagnosed histologically in 68 patients (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of EUS for the diagnosis of N1 were 71%, 74% and 73% (95%CI 65-79), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of EUS in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> is still unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>T2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in particular are frequently overstaged, with a significant effect on the subsequent treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
