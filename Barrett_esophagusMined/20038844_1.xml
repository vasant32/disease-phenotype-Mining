<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about patient characteristics associated with consultation in primary care and referral to secondary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND METHODS: We compared the characteristics of patients with GORS in the general population, those who consulted their general practitioner (GP) and those referred to secondary care for upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify differences between patients with short term (&lt;90 days) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> symptoms, and differences between patients with symptoms in primary and secondary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was performed in a primary care based prospective dynamic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 16% of 7237 adult patients were identified with GORS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five percent of these patients consulted the GP, of whom 40% were referred for endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GORS were older, had a higher body mass index, were more often referred for upper endoscopy (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.001) and more frequently had relevant findings during endoscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>: 50% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>: 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients referred for upper endoscopy were older than nonreferred patients (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Only a minority of people with GORS visit their GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After consulting referral for endoscopy occurs relatively often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Underlying endoscopic abnormalities are frequently found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GORS </plain></SENT>
