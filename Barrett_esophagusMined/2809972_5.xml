<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During the 5-year period from 1981 to 1985, Nissen fundoplication was performed on 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> died because of cardiac malformation 2 weeks after the operation and is excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of the remaining 12 patients had the usual malformation with distal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, while three had isolated atresia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In eight patients there was a long gap between the segments, and in five Livaditis myotomy was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients at the fundoplication was 1.3 years (range, 4.5 months to 10.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main clinical manifestations were anastomotic stricture (six patients), respiratory complications (three patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and difficulties in feeding (two patients), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> only (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether nine patients had preoperative distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up time was 4.1 years (range, 2.0 to 6.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients primarily benefited from the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Routine control endoscopy 3 to 8 months after the operation showed a competent fundoplication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in five patients the reflux later recurred, and endoscopy revealed a partially disrupted fundal wrap and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients underwent refundoplication and one is waiting for it as of this writing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at the last endoscopic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was one late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although the short-term results of Nissen fundoplication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> patients are good, the risk for late recurrence is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Regular long-term follow-up is therefore necessary </plain></SENT>
