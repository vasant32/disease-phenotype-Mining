<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has been increasing, but the prognosis of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is worse because individuals present at a late stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Attempts have been made to intervene at early stage using surveillance programmes, although proof of efficacy of endoscopic surveillance is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is much to be learned about BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whether adequate control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> early in the disease alters the natural history of Barrett's change once it has developed remains unanswered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus there is great need for carefully designed large randomised controlled trials to address these issues in order to determine how best to manage patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The AspECT and BOSS clinical trials proride this basis </plain></SENT>
