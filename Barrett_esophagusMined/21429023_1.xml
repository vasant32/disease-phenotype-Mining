<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is considered to be important because it is associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Japan, there is a high prevalence of short-segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (SS-CLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The natural history of SS-CLE is not fully understood, so the aim of the present study was to investigate the chronological changes of SS-CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 500 consecutive patients with SS-CLE (327 men and 173 women; mean age: 64.0 years) diagnosed between January 2001 and July 2002 at our hospital based on the definition of SS-CLE proposed by the Japanese Society for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Esophageal Diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up endoscopy was carried out annually for a mean period of 5.7 Â± 1.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probability of SS-CLE showing elongation was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and factors related to endoscopic findings making an independent contribution to elongation were determined with Cox's proportional hazard model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elongation of SS-CLE occurred in 29 patients (5.8%) during the follow-up period and the cumulative 5-year probability of elongation was 16.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no progression of SS-CLE to Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The absence of atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 23.4; 95%CI [6.5, 83.8]), the presence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (aOR: 4.53; 95%CI [1.2, 16.4]), and the flame-shaped type of SS-CLE (aOR: 22.4; 95%CI [7.8, 64.0]) were found to be independent contributors to the elongation of SS-CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that SS-CLE remains stable in length over time, especially in patients without atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, as well as in those with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and/or flame-shaped SS-CLE at initial examination </plain></SENT>
