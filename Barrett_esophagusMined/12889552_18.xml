<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To elucidate the histogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, we designed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodeno-gastric reflux</z:e> model in which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stomach function and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nutritional status are retained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were used in the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The esophago-gastric junction was side-to-side anastomosed to a loop of jejunum about 3 cm distal to Treitz's ligament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were not exposed to any known carcinogens during the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential morphological changes were studied for up to 50 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial sections were made and stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, immunohistochemical staining for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was performed along with histochemical staining for mucins using paradoxical concanavalin A (ConA), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> oxidase Schiff (GOS), and high-iron <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15571,23666">diamine</z:chebi>-alcian blue (HID-AB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> with squamous cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At week 20 after surgery, glandular metaplastic cells positive for ConA first appeared within the basal cell layer of esophageal squamous cell epithelium, and then GOS-positive cells and HID-AB goblet cells appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is a characteristic of the specialized columnar epithelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We detected esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in 1 out of 8 subjects at week 40 and in 3 out of 8 subjects at week 50 after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reflux of duodenal contents causes specialized columnar epithelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As part of the sequence of events leading to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, pyloric-foveolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was observed followed by the appearance of intestinal goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The pyloric-foveolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> appears to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mucosal damage and regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This multiplastic cell lineage is referred to as 'gut-regenerative cell lineage' (GRCL) </plain></SENT>
