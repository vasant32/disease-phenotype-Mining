<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and assess the proximity of reflux events in patients with histologically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> using hypopharyngeal multichannel intraluminal impedance (HMII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from patients with histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> (via lung biopsy) who underwent objective esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> testing including high-resolution manometry and HMII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Defective lower esophageal sphincter (LES) was defined as either LES pressure of &lt;5.0 mmHg, total length of LES of &lt;2.4 cm, or intra-abdominal length of LES of &lt;0.9 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal esophageal motility was considered present when failed swallows ≥30% and/or mean wave amplitude &lt;30 mmHg was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HMII used a specialized impedance catheter to directly measure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1168250" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngopharyngeal reflux</z:e> (LPR) and full column reflux (reflux 2 cm distal to the upper esophageal sphincter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the previous study of healthy subjects, abnormal proximal exposure was considered present when LPR ≥1/day and/or full column reflux ≥5/day were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From October 2009 to June 2011, 46 patients were identified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> and sufficient HMII data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 46, 10 patients were excluded because of concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e>, and 8 patients were excluded because they had undergone lung transplantation, which may impact the patterns of reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining 28 patients with histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> (male 16, female 12) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean age and BMI were 60.4 years (range, 41-78) and 28.4 (range, 21.1-38.1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients except one were symptomatic; 23 (82%) patients had concomitant typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms such as heartburn, whereas 4 (14%) patients had isolated pulmonary symptoms such as cough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Esophageal mucosal injury such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was found in 17 (71%) patients, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was found in 19 (73%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Abnormal proximal exposure, which occurred almost exclusively in the upright position, was present in 54% (15/28) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in clinical symptoms, objective findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, and pulmonary functions such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and diffusing capacity of the lung for <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> (DLCO) between patients with and without abnormal proximal exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although the total number of reflux events was significantly higher in patients with abnormal proximal exposure, a large number of patients had a negative DeMeester score regardless of whether abnormal proximal exposure was present (patients with, 80%; those without, 85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients with abnormal proximal exposure more likely had a defective LES compared with those without (93% vs. 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (56%) had abnormal esophageal motility including aperistaltic esophagus (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This first study of HMII in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is highly prevalent (&gt;70%), and abnormal proximal reflux events such as LPR and full column reflux are common despite a frequently negative DeMeester score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>HMII may be beneficial in the work-up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
