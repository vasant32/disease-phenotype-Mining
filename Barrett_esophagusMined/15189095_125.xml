<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contrast between the vascular pattern and the adjacent mucosa of the underside of the human tongue was measured using five narrow-band illuminations and three broadband illuminations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that the pathological features of a vascular pattern are dependent on the center wavelength and the bandwidth of illumination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By utilizing narrow-band illumination of 415+/-30 nm, the contrast of the capillary pattern in the superficial layer was markedly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is an important benefit that is difficult to obtain with ordinary broadband illumination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The appearances of capillary patterns on color images were evaluated for three sets of filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The narrow, band imaging (NBI) filter set (415+/-30 nm, 445+/-30 nm, 500+/-30 nm) was selected to achieve the preferred appearance of the vascular patterns for clinical tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of clinical tests in colonoscopy and esophagoscopy indicated that NBI will be useful as a supporting method for observation of the endoscopic findings of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
