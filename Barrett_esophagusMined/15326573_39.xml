<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Treatment by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) has been established for early lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the remaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> epithelium remains at risk of developing further lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of circumferential endoscopic mucosectomy (circumferential EMR)s in removing not only the index lesion (high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN) or mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>), but also the remaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 21 patients were included in the study (11 men, 10 women), who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and either HGIN (n = 12) or mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 17/21 were at high surgical risk and five had refused surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of preprocedure endosonography their lesions were classified as T1N0 (n = 19) or T0N0 (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lesions and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> epithelium were removed by polypectomy after submucosal injection of 10-15 ml of saline; a double-channel endoscope was used in 15/21 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Circumferential EMR was performed in two sessions, the lesion and the surrounding half of the circumferential <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> mucosa being removed in the first session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In order to prevent the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010450'>esophageal stenosis</z:hpo>, the second half of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> mucosa was resected 1 month later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complications occurred in 4/21 patients (19 %), consisting of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> which was successfully managed by endoscopic hemostasis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No strictures were observed during follow-up (mean duration 18 months) and endoscopic resection was considered complete in 18/21 patients (86 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For three patients, histological examination showed incomplete removal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>: one of these underwent surgery; two received chemoradiotherapy, and showed no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> at 18 months' and 24 months' follow-up, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients in whom resection was initially classified as complete later presented with local recurrence and were treated again by EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> mucosa was completely replaced by squamous cell epithelium in 15/20 patients (75 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Circumferential EMR is a noninvasive treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with HGIN or mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, with a low complication rate and good short-term clinical efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further studies should focus on long-term results and on technical improvements </plain></SENT>
