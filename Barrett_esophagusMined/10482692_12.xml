<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The optimal treatment for Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is still being debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study reported herein was designed to assess the following: (1) the incidence of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>; (2) the ability of laparoscopic fundoplication to control symptoms in patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>; (3) the results of esophagectomy in patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; and (4) the character of endoscopic follow-up programs of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's disease</z:e> being managed by physicians throughout a large geographic region (northern California) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five-hundred thirty-five patients evaluated between October 1989 and February 1997 at the University of California San Francisco Swallowing Center had a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> established by upper gastrointestinal series, endoscopy, manometry, and pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight symptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> underwent laparoscopic fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven other consecutive patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> underwent transhiatal esophagectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was present in 72 (13%) of the 535 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following results were achieved in patients who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication (n = 38): Heartburn resolved in 95% of patients, regurgitation in 93% of patients, and cough in 100% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With regard to transhiatal esophagectomy (n = 11), the average duration of the operation was 339 +/- 89 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only significant complications were two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341563" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal anastomotic leaks</z:e>, both of which resolved without sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean hospital stay was 14 +/- 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The specimens showed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in seven patients and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (undiagnosed preoperatively) in four (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results can be summarized as follows: (1) Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was present in 13% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> being evaluated at a busy diagnostic center; (2) laparoscopic fundoplication was highly successful in controlling symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>; (3) in patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> esophagectomy was performed safely (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> had eluded preoperative endoscopic biopsies in one third of these patients); and (4) even though periodic endoscopic examination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's disease</z:e> is universally recommended, this was actually done in fewer than two thirds of patients being managed by a large number of independent physicians in this geographic area </plain></SENT>
