<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural lesions can be graded on the basis of their severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In grade I, epithelial cells are well preserved in the deepest layers whereas the superficial cells display ultrastructural alterations such as irregular microridges or reduced intercellular junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In grade II, the surface is composed of extruding cells and in the intermediate layer, large intercellular spaces containing lympho-monocytic cells are visible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In grade III, the mucosal surface is characterized by crater-like <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>, degenerating cells are visible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the layers; in two patients columnar epithelium-lined areas (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that in patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, ultrastructural examination of grasp biopsies prelevated by pediatric endoscopes allows a grading of the anatomical lesions providing data that can not be obtained by conventional histology </plain></SENT>
