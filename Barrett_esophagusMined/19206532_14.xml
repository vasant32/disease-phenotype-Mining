<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence tends to produce the lowest detection limits for most forms of capillary electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two issues have discouraged its use in capillary isoelectric focusing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first issue is fluorescent labeling of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most labeling reagents react with lysine residues and convert the cationic residue to a neutral or anionic product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At best, these reagents perturb the isoelectric point of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At worse, they convert each protein into hundreds of different fluorescent products that confound analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second issue is the large background signal generated by impurities within commercial ampholytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This background signal is particularly strong when excited in the blue portion of the spectrum, which is required by many common fluorescent labeling reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This paper addresses these issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For labeling, we employ Chromeo P540, which is a fluorogenic reagent that converts cationic lysine residues to cationic fluorescent products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reaction products are excited in the green, which reduces the background signal generated by impurities present within the ampholytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To further reduce the background signal, we photobleach ampholytes with high-power photodiodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Photobleaching reduced the noise in the ampholyte blank by an order of magnitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Isoelectric focusing performed with photobleached pH 3-10 ampholytes produced concentration detection limits of 270 +/- 25 fM and mass detection limits of 150 +/- 15 zmol for Chromeo P540 labeled beta-lactoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Concentration detection limits were 520 +/- 40 fM and mass detection limits were 310 +/- 30 zmol with pH 4-8 ampholytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A homogenate was prepared from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cell line and separated by capillary isoelectric focusing, reproducibly generating dozens of peaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The sample taken for the separation was equal to the labeled protein homogenate from three cells </plain></SENT>
