<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar conditions in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal diseases</z:e> have led to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e>; i.e.: IBD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MIB-1 (Ki-67) and p53 are monoclonal antibodies that are used to detect early markers for dysplastic changes, possibly leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development in adults patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and/or the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only limited studies of these cell markers have been published in children with EoE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to examine p53 and Ki-67 cell markers in children with EoE before and after medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods: The immunohistochemical staining of cell markers p53 and Ki-67 was examined in esophageal biopsies of children diagnosed with EoE, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, biopsies from adults with EoE and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were used as positive controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 10 children who were successfully treated for EoE, immunohistochemical staining was compared before and after medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results: The immunohistochemical staining of p53 and Ki-67 was increased in children with EoE compared with children with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus but not in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Children with EoE post therapy had significantly lower immunohistochemical staining for both markers compared to pre-treatment staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: p53 and Ki-67 markers are associated with cell proliferation in children with EoE, but do not represent a pre-malignant (dysplastic) condition of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
