<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The origin of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was determined in 12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six cases arose in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 5 cases in esophageal glands, and one case in ectopic gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The postoperative prognosis was closely related to the invasion to the adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> with no adventitial invasion showed excellent results, and their early detection is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> arising in Barrett's epithelium or in leading ducts of esophageal glands presented as small elevated lesions at endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> arising in submucosal glands showed diffuse infiltration into the esophageal wall and were difficult to detect in the early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic examination aided by the staining method or brush cytology is recommended </plain></SENT>
