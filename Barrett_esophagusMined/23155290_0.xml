<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lysozyme is a natural antimicrobial enzyme that is up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathogenic microbes have recently been identified in the esophageal mucosa in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lysozyme expression was evaluated in biopsies from patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-seven consecutive esophageal biopsies with columnar-lined Barrett's mucosa (BM) were investigated: 16 had oxyntic gland-only BM, 19 pyloric gland-only BM and 62, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric biopsies and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> duodenal biopsies were included as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sections were stained with human lysozyme antiserum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lysozyme was up-regulated in the neck glands in 94% of the biopsies with oxyntic gland-only BM, in the pyloric gland in 79% of the biopsies with pyloric gland-only BM, and in goblet cells in 65% of the biopsies with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Goblet cells with faint lysozyme expression were often found in glands overexpressing lysozyme in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_547'>mucous secretions</z:mpath> in the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared to controls, lysozyme was up-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three BM phenotypes (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lysozyme is up-regulated in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is therefore, believed that lysozyme's up-regulation might mirror a molecular mechanism of self-defence aimed to safeguard the BM against the hostile pathogenic microbiota present in the esophageal microenvironment in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
