<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the difference of gene expression profile changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CIM) and to screen the novel genes in the early stage by cDNA microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: cDNA retrotranscribed from an equal amount of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from BE and CIM epithelial tissues was labeled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37990">Cy3</z:chebi> and Cy5 fluorescence as probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mixed probe was hybridized with three pieces of BiostarH-40 s double dot human whole gene chip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chips were scanned with a ScanArray 4000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The acquired images were analyzed using GenePix Pro 3.0 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 141 genes were screened out that exhibited different expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three chips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 74 upregulated and 67 downregulated genes in gene expression profiles of BE which were two times of that in CIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a difference in gene expression level between BE and CIM epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These 141 genes probably relate to the occurrence and development of BE and the progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
