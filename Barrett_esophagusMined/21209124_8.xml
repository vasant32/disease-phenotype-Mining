<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the safety of stepwise radical ER (SRER) versus focal ER followed by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for complete eradication of BO containing HGD/EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicentre randomised clinical trial was carried out in three tertiary centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with BO ≤ 5 cm containing HGD/EC were randomised to SRER or ER/RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the SRER group underwent piecemeal ER of 50% of BO followed by serial ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the ER/RFA group underwent focal ER for visible lesions followed by serial RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up endoscopy with biopsies (four-quadrant/2 cm BO) was performed at 6 and 12 months and then annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were: stenosis rate; complications; complete histological response for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (CR-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>); and complete histological response for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CR-IM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CR-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was achieved in 25/25 (100%) SRER and in 21/22 (96%) ER/RFA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CR-IM was achieved in 23 (92%) SRER and 21 (96%) ER/RFA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The stenosis rate was significantly higher in SRER (88%) versus ER/RFA (14%; p&lt;0.001), resulting in more therapeutic sessions in SRER (6 vs 3; p&lt;0.001) due to dilations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After median 24 months follow-up, one SRER patient had recurrence of EC, requiring ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with BO ≤ 5 cm containing HGD/EC, SRER and ER/RFA achieved comparably high rates of CR-IM and CR-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, SRER was associated with a higher number of complications and therapeutic sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For these patients, a combined endoscopic approach of focal ER followed by RFA may thus be preferred over SRER </plain></SENT>
