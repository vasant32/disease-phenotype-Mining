<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase isoforms pGPx and GI-GPx, which were identified recently in the mucosa of the esophagus, may play a role as defense factors to prevent such oxidative injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine alterations of the expression of pGPx and GI-GPx in Barrett's mucosa as compared to primary and regenerative squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples of oesophageal mucosa of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 12), patients with squamous restoration after thermal ablation (n = 10), and healthy controls (n = 5) were analyzed for pGPx and GI-GPx <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression by Northern blot and for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activity by enzymatic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Squamous regeneration was induced by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's epithelium <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of pGPx (the secreted isoform) were significantly reduced and of GI-GPx (the intracellular isoform) significantly increased as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In squamous mucosa that had regenerated after APC, no significant differences compared to the expression pattern of primary squamous mucosa were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to squamous mucosa, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> shows a different <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of pGPx and GI-GPx that may be associated with increased susceptibility to oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
