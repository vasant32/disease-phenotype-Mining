<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the gastric cardia and distal oesophagus are at present often considered as one clinical entity because of their comparable increasing incidence, prognosis, and optimal treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still a matter of debate whether these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> have the same pathogenesis and genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyse expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in cardia <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, and correlate this expression with clinicopathological parameters and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with the prognostic value of COX-2 found for Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> sections of 134 consecutive patients undergoing potentially curative surgery for an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the gastric cardia and substantially invading the distal oesophagus were immunohistochemically stained using a COX-2 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specimens were blindly scored based on intensity and extent of COX-2 immunopositivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: COX-2 expression was negative to weak in 59% ("COX-2 low") and moderate to strong in 41% ("COX-2 high") of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was significantly lower than in Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>COX-2 expression was not correlated with any clinicopathological parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A correlation between elevated COX-2 expression and reduced survival, as described for Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, was not identified for cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a difference in COX-2 expression with respect to intensity and prognostic significance between <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the gastric cardia and distal oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests a different pathogenesis and different genetic constitution of these two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, the role of selective COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the gastric cardia is less promising than in Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
