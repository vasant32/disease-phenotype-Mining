<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients who received esophagogastroduodenoscopy either as a part of therapy for various upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo> or as an annual health check-up were evaluated for the existence of ESEM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsy with standardized random four pieces every 2 cm from the four quarters of esophagus with ESEM lesion was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BE was defined by histological verification of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> and was categorized according to the Prague C and M criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 5,179 subjects were screened from Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2007 to Dec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study enrolled 4,797, including 3,386 for referral endoscopy and 1,411 for screening endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of BE among the referral endoscopy, screening endoscopy, and overall was 1.06%, 0.35%, and 0.85%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 41 subjects with BE were detected among 93 ESEM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Short segment BE (75.6%, n=31) was more prevalent than long segment BE (24.4%, n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proportions of BE from subjects with ESEM by Prague C and M criteria were C&lt; or =1M1 38.9% (19/50), C&lt; or =1M2 40% (12/30), and CxM&gt; or =3 76.9% (10/13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the standardized protocol with random four-quadrate endoscopic biopsy, we have demonstrated the utility of Prague C and M criteria to characterize the BE in an ethnic Chinese population </plain></SENT>
