<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> underwent digital videofluorography, endoscopy with biopsies, motility studies and 24-h oesophageal pH-monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the results of the diagnostic procedures and considering the patients' ages and response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitor</z:chebi> treatment, 8 patients underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication; in 5 cases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was present at histopathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of these had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> at endoscopy and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was associated with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in both at histology; the other 3 did not present a columnar mucosa at endoscopy and 1 had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients, at 1 year postoperative histopathological control, disappearance or decrease of metaplastic epithelium and regression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were noted, with excellent results in terms of reflux symptoms at clinical control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these preliminary data, it is our opinion that antireflux surgery is not only a suitable treatment in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> but also has a favourable effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> regression when a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal mucosa is present </plain></SENT>
