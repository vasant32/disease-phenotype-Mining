<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Accelerated cellular proliferation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has been implicated in Barrett's elongation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, growth factors may play important roles in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regenerating gene (REG), an epithelial growth factor, has been reported to link mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether REG is expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and to elucidate the relationship between REG protein expression and clinicopathological factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between July 2003 and June 2004, 266 patients with endoscopically and histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before endoscopic examination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were requested to answer structured questionnaires on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242510" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drugs usage</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mucin phenotype, cyclooxygenase-2 expression, cellular proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and REG Ialpha protein expression were investigated in the biopsy samples taken from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological factors that correlated with REG Ialpha protein expression in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: REG Ialpha protein expression was observed in 48 (18.0%) of 266 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Newly developed squamous re-epithelialization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at biopsy sites, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and aging were shown to correlate with REG Ialpha protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first to show REG expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of REG Ialpha was more frequently observed in patients who showed squamous re-epithelialization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at biopsy sites </plain></SENT>
