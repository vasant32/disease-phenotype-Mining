<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a metaplastic condition of the esophagus, in which areas or islands of "gastric-type" epithelium are found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether C. pylori colonized the esophagus of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, we studied retrospectively 23 unselected patients who had endoscopic and biopsy evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mucosal biopsy specimens were stained by the Warthin-Starry silver technique and reviewed by an experienced, "blinded" histopathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 23 patients, 12 (52%) had C. pylori in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with and those without C. pylori were of similar age and gender, had similar scores for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and had similar lengths of tubular esophagus with metaplastic gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that C. pylori commonly infects <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical importance of this finding is unknown </plain></SENT>
