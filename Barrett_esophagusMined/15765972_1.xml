<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> are analyzed as a single condition because prognosis is similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to define prognostic factors in EC, considering each histopathologic type independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied a retrospective cohort of patients treated from 1981 to 2001 at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute (Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog√≠a, INCan) in Mexico City </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with EC (including siewert I type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>), with endoscopic biopsy, of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> older than 18 years of age, and with complete clinical evaluation were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 236 cases were included: 60 (25.4%) were <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 176 (74.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median survival times were 5.2 months (95% CI, 0.7 to 9.6) and 2.9 months (95% CI, 2.2 to 3.6 months), respectively (p = 0.0042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In bivariate analysis, age, histopathologic type, T classification, M classification, differentiation grade, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, surgical resection, and use of other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> treatments were related to survival (p = 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At our hospital, EC is a lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> with a dismal prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has a better prognosis than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in multivariate analysis, T classification and possibility of surgical resection were the most important prognostic factors determining survival </plain></SENT>
