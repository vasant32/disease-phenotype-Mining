<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although short-term endpoints of ablation have been ascertained, there have been concerns about recurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to estimate the incidence and identify factors that predicted the recurrence of IM after successful RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from 592 patients with BE treated with RFA from 2003 through 2011 at 3 tertiary referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete remission of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (CRIM) was defined as eradication of IM (in esophageal and gastro-esophageal junction biopsies), documented by 2 consecutive endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was defined as presence of IM or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> after CRIM in surveillance biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two experienced gastrointestinal pathologists confirmed pathology findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on histology analysis, before RFA, 71% of patients had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 15% had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 14% had non-dysplastic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of patients treated, 448 (76%) were assessed following RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>55% of patients underwent endoscopic mucosal resection before RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time to CRIM was 22 months, with 56% of patients in CRIM by 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increasing age and length of BE segment were associated with a longer times to CRIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four months after CRIM, the incidence of recurrence was 33%; 22% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recurrences observed were dysplastic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no demographic or endoscopic factors associated with recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Complications developed in 6.5% of subjects treated with RFA; strictures were the most common complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Of patients with BE treated by RFA, 56% are in complete remission after 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, 33% of these patients have disease recurrence within the next 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Most recurrences were non-dysplastic and endoscopically manageable, but continued surveillance after RFA is essential </plain></SENT>
