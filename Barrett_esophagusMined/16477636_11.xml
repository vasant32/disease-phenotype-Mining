<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) is a gene involved in DNA repair, which is methylated in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, hypermethylation of MGMT has been correlated with p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 132 samples of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 58 samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal tissue were investigated for MGMT hypermethylation status by methylation-specific real-time PCR and results were correlated to clinicopathological parameters, patient's survival, p53 mutation and expression of p53 protein and MGMT protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, hypermethylation of MGMT was found in 63.6% of cases and loss of MGMT protein expression in 48.5% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MGMT hypermethylation was found in 5.7% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal smooth muscle tissue, in 20.0% of esophageal squamous epithelium and in 61.5% of nonneoplastic Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, hypermethylation of the MGMT gene was correlated with loss MGMT protein expression (p &lt; 0.0001) and with high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation (p = 0.0079) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no correlation between MGMT hypermethylation, Lauren's classification, WHO classification, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, gender, age, pT category and pN category, and p53 status was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither MGMT hypermethylation nor loss of MGMT protein expression was correlated with patient's survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MGMT hypermethylation in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is a frequent event that is associated with loss of MGMT protein expression but not with patient's outcome </plain></SENT>
