<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the results of a pilot, ex vivo study of tissues from 27 patients undergoing partial colonic resection surgery, conducted to evaluate the ability of a/LCI to identify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Performance was determined by comparing the nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> measurements with pathological assessment of co-located physical biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant correlation between increased average nuclear size, reduced nuclear density, and the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was noted at the basal layer of the epithelium, at a depth of 200 to 300 Î¼m beneath the tissue surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a decision line determined from a receiver operating characteristic, a/LCI was able to separate dysplastic from healthy tissues with a sensitivity of 92.9% (13/14), a specificity of 83.6% (56/67), and an overall accuracy of 85.2% (69/81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study illustrates the extension of the a/LCI technique to the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0000477'>intestinal dysplasia</z:mp>, and demonstrates the need for future in vivo studies </plain></SENT>
