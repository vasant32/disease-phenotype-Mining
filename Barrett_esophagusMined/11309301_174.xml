<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic studies of this model have thus far been limited to the DNA methylation analysis of a few genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed a panel of 20 genes using a quantitative, high-throughput methylation assay, METHYLIGHT: We used this broader approach to gain insight into concordant methylation behavior between genes and to generate epigenomic fingerprints for the different histological stages of EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study included a total of 104 tissue specimens from 51 patients with different stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and/or associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We screened 84 of these samples with the full panel of 20 genes and found distinct classes of methylation patterns in the different types of tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most informative genes were those with an intermediate frequency of significant hypermethylation [ranging from 15% (CDKN2A) to 60% (MGMT) of the samples] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This group could be further subdivided into three classes, according to the absence (CDKN2A, ESR1, and MYOD1) or presence (CALCA, MGMT, and TIMP3) of methylation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa and stomach, or the infrequent methylation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa accompanied by methylation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stomach samples (APC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other genes were less informative, because the frequency of hypermethylation was below 5% (ARF, CDH1, CDKN2B, GSTP1, MLH1, PTGS2, and THBS1), completely absent (CTNNB1, RB1, TGFBR2, and TYMS1), or ubiquitous (HIC1 and MTHFR), regardless of tissue type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each class undergoes unique epigenetic changes at different steps of disease progression of EAC, suggesting a step-wise loss of multiple protective barriers against CpG island hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The aberrant hypermethylation occurs at many different loci in the same tissues, suggestive of an overall deregulation of methylation control in EAC <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, we did not find evidence for a distinct group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a CpG island methylator phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_605'>metaplastic tissues</z:mpath> from patients with evidence of associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> had a significantly higher incidence of hypermethylation than similar tissues from patients with no further progression of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The fact that the samples from these two groups of patients were histologically indistinguishable, yet molecularly distinct, suggests that the occurrence of such hypermethylation may provide a clinical tool to identify patients with premalignant Barrett's who are at risk for further progression </plain></SENT>
