<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Testing for GER included voice analysis, EGD, esophageal manometry, Bernstein test, and ambulatory 24-hr pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six of the 11 (55%) hoarse patients studied had GER by pH monitoring (mean score 105 +/- 23), and most reflux episodes were supine and prolonged (20.9 +/- 8.2% supine pH less than 4.0, longest 129 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with abnormal pH monitoring had endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in two, peptic stricture in one, and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in three), while none of the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scores had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of throat pain or nocturnal heartburn were more common in the GER-positive patients (6 of 6 vs 1 of 5), and clinically helpful in discriminating which hoarse patients had pathologic GER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi> 150 mg per os twice a day for 12 weeks improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, but the voice improved in only one of the two patients with completely healed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that (1) GER is frequently seen in patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarseness</z:hpo> (55%), (2) hoarse patients with throat pain or nocturnal heartburn are likely to have severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and should be evaluated by EGD, and (3) additional antireflux and voice therapy may be necessary to heal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and improve the voice </plain></SENT>
