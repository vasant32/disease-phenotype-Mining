<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study documented the frequency of microsatellite alterations at 139 loci, comprising predominantly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> and tetranucleotide repeat units, in 17 cases of primary esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising against a background of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> demonstrated alterations in at least one locus studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Widespread microsatellite alterations, occurring at 45.3% (58 of 128) of loci tested, were detected in a single case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 16 tumors exhibited low levels of microsatellite instability, ranging from 0.8% (1 of 128) to 8.1% (10 of 123) of loci tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The single case with ubiquitous somatic alterations showed no significant difference in the incidence of novel alleles at di- and tetranucleotide repeat loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 16 cases showing a low level of microsatellite alterations demonstrated a 3.3-fold higher incidence of novel alleles at tetranucleotide repeat loci compared to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that ubiquitous somatic alterations at microsatellite loci, considered a phenotypic expression of defective mismatch repair, occur infrequently in Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> demonstrate a low level of microsatellite alterations, perhaps reflecting the inherent instability of these markers </plain></SENT>
