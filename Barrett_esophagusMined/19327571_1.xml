<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This difficulty stems in part from drawbacks in the classification systems designed to stratify early lesions as a guide for deciding treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These systems are complex and wrought with specific pathologic challenges brought on by new treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such interventions as endoscopic mucosal resection, photodynamic therapy, and chemotherapy/radiation combinations present the pathologist with new histologic challenges that have a direct impact on patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this article, we discuss staging issues pertinent to early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, histologic sequelae of various treatments, and how these factors affect the pathologist's role in evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
