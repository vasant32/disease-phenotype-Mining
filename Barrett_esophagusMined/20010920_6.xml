<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of endoscopic findings and their association with dyspeptic symptoms in the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1,533 inhabitants of two villages were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey, and 1,033 were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent a validated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> questionnaire, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and a (13)C-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> breath test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoscopic findings were present in 17.6% of asymptomatic subjects and in 27.4% of those with dyspeptic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in subjects with dyspeptic symptoms and without prominent reflux symptoms was 8.1 and 1.5%, respectively, and was similar to that of asymptomatic subjects (8.5 and 0.7%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>Esophagitis</z:hpo> was significantly associated with dyspeptic symptoms only in subjects with concomitant prominent reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>Peptic ulcer</z:hpo> (PU) was present in 8.8% of subjects with dyspeptic symptoms without reflux symptoms and similarly in 9.4% of those with prominent reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with dyspeptic symptoms and concomitant prominent reflux symptoms had an increased risk of having an underlying PU (odds ratio 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.30-5.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Almost three-quarters of subjects with dyspeptic symptoms do not have endoscopic findings and, in addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> may not be the cause of dyspeptic symptoms in subjects without prominent reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PU may be the cause of dyspeptic symptoms in a subgroup of subjects with prominent reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
