<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accurate dosimetry is critical for successful ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, in vivo dosimetry and kinetics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> fluorescence photobleaching were studied in a rat model of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fluence and fluence rate were standardized in vivo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> fluorescence was measured simultaneously at the esophageal wall during ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and plotted against the delivered fluence rather than time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats with BE were administered 200 mg kg(-1) ALA (n = 17) or served as control (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were irradiated with 633 nm laser light at a measured fluence rate of 75 mW cm(-2) and a fluence of 54 J cm(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Large differences were observed in the kinetics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> fluorescence photobleaching in different animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> fluorescence photobleaching rates corresponded with tissue ablation, whereas low rates corresponded with no damage to the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Attempts to influence tissue oxygenation by varying balloon pressure and ventilation were shown not to be directly responsible for the differences in effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in vivo dosimetry is feasible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> conditions such as BE, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> fluorescence photobleaching is useful to predict the tissue response to ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
