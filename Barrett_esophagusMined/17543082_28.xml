<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine interobserver variation in grading of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) between non-expert general pathologists and expert gastrointestinal pathologists on the one hand and between expert pathologists on the other hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective multicentre study, non-expert and expert pathologists graded biopsy specimens of 920 patients with endoscopic BO, which were blindly reviewed by one member of a panel of expert pathologists (panel experts) and by a second panel expert in case of disagreement on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Agreement between two of three pathologists was established as the final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis was performed by kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, 127/920 (14%) patients were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interobserver agreement for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> [no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND) versus indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (IND/LGD) versus high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD)/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC)] between non-experts and first panel experts and between initial experts and first panel experts was fair (kappa = 0.24 and kappa = 0.27, respectively), and substantial for differentiation of HGD/AC from ND/IND/LGD (kappa = 0.62 and kappa = 0.58, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable interobserver variability in the interpretation of ND or IND/LGD in BO between non-experts and experts, but also between expert pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that less subjective markers are needed to determine the risk of developing AC in BO </plain></SENT>
