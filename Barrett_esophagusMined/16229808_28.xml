<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of GPx3, and explored promoter hypermethylation as an epigenetic mechanism for GPx3 gene inactivation during Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on 42 Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (BAs) revealed consistently reduced levels of GPx3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in 91% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GPx3 promoter hypermethylation was detected in 62% of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, 82% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 88% of BA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of both alleles of GPx3 was most frequently seen in BAs (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining of GPx3 in matching tissue sections (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, BE, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and BA) revealed strong immunostaining for GPx3 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal and gastric tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, weak to absent GPx3 staining was observed in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> samples where the promoter was hypermethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of loss of immunohistochemistry correlated with the hypermethylation pattern (monoallelic versus biallelic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observed high frequency of promoter hypermethylation and progressive loss of GPx3 expression in BA and its associated lesions, together with its known function as a potent <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, suggest that epigenetic inactivation and regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> pathway may be critical in the development and progression of BE </plain></SENT>
