<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclo-oxygenase-2 appears to play an important role in gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies on cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression in Barrett's oesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> have utilized tissue samples obtained from different patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought a definitive comparison of cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression in the sequence of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> within the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paraffin-embedded oesophago-gastrectomy specimens from 20 patients, containing successive stages of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, were analysed for cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cyclo-oxygenase-2 was constitutively expressed in the basal layers of cells in the adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous oesophageal epithelium, but a higher cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression was observed in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A further increase in cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression was detected in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, but cyclo-oxygenase-2 was decreased in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissue, regardless of its stage or level of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression is progressively increased when squamous oesophageal epithelium develops into Barrett's metaplastic epithelium and then into high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, but appears to decrease when <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> develops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings may be significant for an effective chemo-prevention strategy with selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
