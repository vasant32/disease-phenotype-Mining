<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was identified in 84 patients (8 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 362 patients seen between 1980 and 1981 were reviewed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The symptoms in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> differed from those of the patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> was more often present in the former group (34 percent versus 16 percent, p less than 0.05) and epigastric distress was less frequent (11 percent versus 27 percent, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Objective findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcers</z:mp> occurred more commonly in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> than in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (70 percent versus 48 percent, 31 percent versus 4 percent, and 14 percent versus 6 percent, respectively, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> were associated almost exclusively with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (five of six patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At esophagoscopy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> was seen more commonly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was suspected by the endoscopist in only 34 percent of patients subsequently demonstrated histopathologically to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the prevalence of a positive Bernstein test result or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> on upper gastrointestinal series in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter</z:e> was found more commonly in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (100 percent versus 53 percent, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 84 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (15 percent) had a coexistent <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising from Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These patients, when compared with the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, were more often male (77 percent versus 51 percent, p = 0.1), more often had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (69 percent versus 34 percent, p less than 0.05), and more frequently had a comparatively short duration of symptoms (67 percent versus 36 percent, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have a high risk of development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because the entity is often not recognized at endoscopy, routine esophageal biopsy should be performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing esophagoscopy for symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> should be followed closely with repeated endoscopy and biopsy </plain></SENT>
