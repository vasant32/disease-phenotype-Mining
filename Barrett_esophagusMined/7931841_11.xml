<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the two trefoil <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> pS2 and human spasmolytic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (hSP) and their <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> was investigated in 90 selected oesophageal biopsies, 23 of which contained epithelium with wholly gastric cardiac-type <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, 52 specialized (intestinal)-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, and 15 non-metaplastic oesophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No fundic-type epithelium was represented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cardiac-type epithelium resembled true gastric antral epithelium, with hSP and pS2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> localization to the superficial/foveolar compartment and hSP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> alone in deeper glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> distribution was broadly in line with the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, but hSP <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was generally not demonstrable in the surface epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>pS2 immunostaining was diffusely cytoplasmic, whereas in specialized-type mucosa it was aggregated and cytoplasmic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>hSP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was demonstrable in surface epithelium of incomplete- but not complete-type intestinal (specialized) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deep glands with morphological features of pyloric glands/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>-associated cell lineage (UACL) typically contained only hSP <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three biopsies containing specialized epithelium, small foci morphologically identical to true small intestinal surface epithelium were seen in which only pS2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were found and then only in rare goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither squamous epithelium nor oesophageal glands contained demonstrable pS2/hSP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their localization facilitates definition of the disparate epithelium types seen in this portion of the gut, with both native gastric and intestinal epithelia, and may help to pinpoint high-risk epithelium in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, a potentially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282313" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preneoplastic condition</z:e> </plain></SENT>
