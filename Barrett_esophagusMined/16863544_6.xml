<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Esophageal mucosal response to acid exposure varies from minimal changes to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>/ulcerations and Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While differences in acid contact time have been suggested, the reason for these different responses is not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify and compare gene expression differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distal and proximal squamous esophageal mucosa (SM) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients with that of healthy controls and Barrett's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gene microarray was performed on laser-capture microdissected epithelial cells isolated from biopsy specimens followed by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of acidic pH (pH 4.5) on Dickkopf Homolog 1 (Dkk-1) expression in the human esophageal epithelial cell line (Het-1A) was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gene microarray analysis demonstrated that the upregulation of five genes in the distal compared with the proximal SM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients was greater than the healthy controls and Barrett's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Dkk-1 and Dkk-4 was further confirmed by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dkk-1 and Dkk-4 mRNA levels in the distal SM of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients were 7.0- and 3.1-fold higher, respectively, than in the distal SM of the Barrett's patients and 4.1- and 4.1-fold higher than in healthy controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dkk-1 protein expression in the distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> SM was also higher than the Barrett's patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Acidic pH exposure of Het-1A cells resulted in Dkk-1 upregulation at the level of both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dkk-1 and Dkk-4 may potentially be involved in the development of different injuries in response to pathological gastroesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
