<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Variceal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is a major complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, and is associated with a 20 % mortality at 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current international guidelines recommend that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> are screened by conventional upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, EGD) in order to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recently developed PillCam ESO esophageal capsule endoscope has been shown to be an accurate diagnostic tool in the investigation of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the PillCam ESO capsule endoscope with EGD for the detection of esophagogastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580174" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal hypertensive gastropathy</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A pilot trial was conducted at three sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> who were undergoing clinically indicated EGD for screening or surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> underwent a PillCam ESO study followed by an EGD within 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Capsule videos were assessed by an investigator who was blinded to the patient's medical history and EGD findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 23 of the 32 enrolled patients were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> at both EGD and PillCam ESO endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one patient PillCam ESO detected small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> that were not seen at EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall concordance between PillCam ESO and EGD was 96.9 % for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> and 90.6 % for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580174" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal hypertensive gastropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no adverse events related to PillCam ESO endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a high-prevalence population, PillCam ESO may represent an accurate noninvasive alternative to EGD for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580174" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal hypertensive gastropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A large-scale trial is underway to validate and expand these findings </plain></SENT>
