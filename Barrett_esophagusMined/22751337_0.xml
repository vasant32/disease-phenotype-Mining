<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms reported in patients with eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> has suggested that the two disorders may be associated; however, few studies have systematically addressed this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GOALS: To determine the frequency of the simultaneous occurrence of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and define the clinical characteristics of patients with both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY: From a national pathology database of patients who had esophagogastroduodenoscopy with mucosal biopsies we extracted patients with a diagnosis of Barrett mucosa, eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> pattern of injury [(���15 eosinophils/high-power field (HPF)], or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then evaluated their respective clinicopathologic associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 233,662 unique patients evaluated during the study period, Barrett mucosa without increased eosinophils was diagnosed in 29,733 patients (12.7%; median age 63 y; 67.6% male); eosinophil counts of ≥15/HPF were recorded in 9509 patients without Barrett mucosa (4.1%; median age 44 y; 63.9% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A simultaneous diagnosis of Barrett mucosa and ≥15 eosinophils/HPF in the squamous epithelium and was made in 404 unique patients (0.17%; median age 56 y; 79.5% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed prevalence of the simultaneous occurrence of the two conditions was one third of that expected if they occurred independently (odds ratio 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.33; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a strong inverse relationship between Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and eosinophilic infiltrates in the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the influence of diagnostic bias cannot be excluded, the possibility that eosinophilic infiltrates in the esophageal mucosa prevent subsequent metaplastic changes may deserve to be explored </plain></SENT>
