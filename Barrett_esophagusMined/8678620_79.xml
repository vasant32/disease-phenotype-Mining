<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The authors review the results and outcomes of esophagectomy (prophylactic esophagectomy) for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The role of prophylactic esophagectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with HGD is controversial, with some authors recommending surgery and others favoring endoscopic surveillance until biopsy diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1982 and 1994, 30 consecutive patients with HGD underwent esophagectomy and had the pre- and postoperative pathology reviewed at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The medical records were reviewed to determine patient characteristics, preoperative endoscopic data, surgical approach, operative morbidity and mortality, length of hospitalization, and treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups based on whether invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was found in the resection specimen (group 1) or not (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The duration of reflux symptoms was 22 +/- 14 years for group 1 and 9 +/- 11 years for group 2 (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was one operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (3.3%) and six complications (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients (43%, group 1), invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was found in the resected esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> stage for these patients was stage I (8 patients), stage II (2 patients), and stage III (3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One stage I patient died of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (72 months) in an incompletely excised HGD segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other stage I and II patients are alive without <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with an 18-and 63-month mean follow-up, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Outcome for stage III patients was one operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, one noncancer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (6 months), and one patient with metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (26 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For group 2 (57%), there were no <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (40 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath> is an indication for esophagectomy because of the prevalence of occult <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy can be performed safely, and survival in patients with completely resected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and early-stage <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is excellent </plain></SENT>
