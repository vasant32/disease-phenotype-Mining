<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cervical inlet patch (CIP) is defined by the presence of gastric mucosa within the first few centimeters of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several endoscopic series have demonstrated a frequent association of CIP with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) suggesting a pathogenetic link </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A histochemical study reporting the presence of acid mucin in CIP, including sulfomucin, supports this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated mucin core protein expression and cytokeratins 7 and 20 (CK7/CK20) pattern in biopsies of CIP, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antrum, and BE to comment on a possible relationship of CIP with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed that both lesions have similar cytokeratin patterns with mixed CK7/CK20 reactivity on the surface and pits and lone CK7 positivity in the glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MUC5AC was strongly expressed on the surface and pits but not in the glands of CIP and antral mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within BE, MUC5AC positivity was noted not only on the surface and pits but also in the glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MUC6 similarly decorated the glands of CIP and BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MUC2 was expressed rarely in CIP with goblet cells but conspicuously on the surface and pits of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MUC5B was seen in both CIP and BE and rarely in the antral mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The similarities between CIP and BE but not with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antral mucosa fits with the hypothesis that both lesions may originate from submucosal esophageal mucous glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two pathogenetic pathways can be entertained: focal upper esophageal mucosal misdevelopment in pediatric population and patchy metaplastic replacement of squamous mucosa in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
