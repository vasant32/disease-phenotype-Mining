<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The causes of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus and gastric cardia are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted an epidemiologic investigation of the possible association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a nationwide, population-based, case-control study in Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case ascertainment was rapid, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were classified uniformly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on the subjects' history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> was collected in personal interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios were calculated by logistic regression, with multivariate adjustment for potentially confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the patients interviewed, the 189 with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and the 262 with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the cardia constituted 85 percent of the 529 patients in Sweden who were eligible for the study during the period from 1995 through 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we interviewed 820 control subjects from the general population and 167 patients with esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among persons with recurrent symptoms of reflux, as compared with persons without such symptoms, the odds ratios were 7.7 (95 percent confidence interval, 5.3 to 11.4) for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.9) for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The more frequent, more severe, and longer-lasting the symptoms of reflux, the greater the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among persons with long-standing and severe symptoms of reflux, the odds ratios were 43.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 18.3 to 103.5) for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 4.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 11.0) for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinoma</z:hpo> was not associated with reflux (odds ratio, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 1.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong and probably causal relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The relation between reflux and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the gastric cardia is relatively weak </plain></SENT>
