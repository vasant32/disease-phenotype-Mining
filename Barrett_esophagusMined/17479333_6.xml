<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report details our experience with this technique and the lessons we have learned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent minimally invasive transhiatal esophagectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parameters assessed included patient demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathology, operative and postoperative course, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients underwent minimally invasive transhiatal esophagectomy [median age = 69 years (range = 36-79)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen were operated on for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, including 13 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> (median histological stage = 2, range = 1-3), and 1 for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had neoadjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent nonemergency conversion to open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median duration of operation was 300 min (range = 180-450) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> anastomoses were end-to-side hand-sewn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patients received a red cell transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality was zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complications developed in 15 patients, including 7 respiratory and 10 recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were two anastomotic leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Six patients developed stenosis requiring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The median length of stay was 15 days (range = 10-39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The median number of nodes harvested was 10 (range = 2-26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 13 months (range = 4-42), 13 patients were alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive transhiatal esophagectomy is feasible in our unit, with acceptable mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The high rate of anastomotic stenosis has resulted in a change to a semimechanical, side-to-side isoperistaltic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The high rate of recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries has resulted in the avoidance of metal retractors at the tracheo-esophageal groove </plain></SENT>
