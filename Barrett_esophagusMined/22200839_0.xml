<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the stem cell organisation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophagus or Barrett's metaplastic oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using non-pathogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA mutations as clonal markers, the authors reveal the stem cell organisation of the human squamous oesophagus and of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and determine the mechanism of clonal expansion of mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mutated cells were identified using enzyme histochemistry to detect activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase (<z:chebi fb="12" ids="16236">CCO</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="12" ids="16236">CCO</z:chebi>-deficient cells were laser-captured and mutations confirmed by PCR sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell lineages were identified using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous oesophagus contained <z:chebi fb="12" ids="16236">CCO</z:chebi>-deficient patches varying in size from around 30 Î¼m up to about 1 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patches were clonal as each area within a <z:chebi fb="12" ids="16236">CCO</z:chebi>-deficient patch contained an identical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> partially <z:chebi fb="12" ids="16236">CCO</z:chebi>-deficient glands indicate that glands are maintained by multiple stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Wholly mutated Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> glands containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the expected differentiated cell lineages were seen, demonstrating multilineage differentiation from a clonal population of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patches of clonally mutated Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> glands were observed, indicating glands can divide to form patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one patient, both the regenerating squamous epithelium and the underlying glandular tissue shared a clonal mutation, indicating that they are derived from a common progenitor cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal squamous epithelium, a single stem cell clone can populate large areas of epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> glands are clonal units, contain multiple multipotential stem cells and most likely divide by fission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a single cell of origin can give rise to both squamous and glandular epithelium suggesting oesophageal plasticity </plain></SENT>
