<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from the prospective Netherlands Cohort Study were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cohort study was initiated in 1986, when 120,852 subjects aged 55-69 years completed a questionnaire on dietary habits and lifestyle, and provided toenail clippings for the determination of baseline <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 16.3 years of follow-up, 253 BE cases (identified through linkage with the nationwide Dutch pathology registry) and 2,039 subcohort members were available for case-cohort analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate incidence rate ratios (RR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The multivariable-adjusted RR for the highest versus the lowest quartile of toenail <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> was 1.06 (95% CI 0.71-1.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No dose-response trend was seen (p trend = 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was found in subgroups defined by sex, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), or intake of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For BE cases that later progressed to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the RR for a <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> level above the median vs. below the median was 0.64 (95% CI 0.24-1.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective cohort study, we found no evidence of an association between <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> and risk of BE </plain></SENT>
