<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare the characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and identify potential risk factors for the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outpatients from a gastroenterology clinic who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24-hr pH monitoring were recruited into a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 256 case subjects with endoscopically and histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were compared to a control group of 229 subjects with nonerosive reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As compared to nonerosive reflux disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was strongly associated with more reflux episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> occurred more frequently among subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> and among subjects who consumed large amounts of alcohol or cigarettes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequent reflux episodes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo>, smoking, and alcohol consumption were also risk factors for an <z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>increased length</z:mp> of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total esophageal mucosal acid contact time at pH &lt; 4 was a significant risk factor for the length but not the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intake of aspirin or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> was similar in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in comparison with nonerosive reflux disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is characterized by risk factors usually indicative of severe types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms in addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> must contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
