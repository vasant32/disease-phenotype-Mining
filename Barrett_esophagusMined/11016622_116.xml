<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional silencing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes by promoter CpG island hypermethylation has been observed in many types of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of CpG island hypermethylation in EAC has thus far been limited to the CDKN2A (p16) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we extend the methylation analysis of EAC to include three other genes, APC, CDH1 (E-cadherin), and ESR1 (ER, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor alpha), in addition to CDKN2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis can provide insight into the complex relationships between tissues with different histologies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have mapped the spatial distribution of methylation patterns in six esophagectomy cases in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of the four CpG islands was analyzed by the MethyLight technique in 107 biopsies derived from these six patients for a total of 428 methylation analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous epithelium is unmethylated at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four CpG islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CDH1 is unmethylated in most other tissue types as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of ESR1 is seen at high frequency in inflammatory reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequent stages, whereas APC and CDKN2A hypermethylation is found in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When it occurs, hypermethylation of APC, CDKN2A, and ESR1 is usually found in a large contiguous field, suggesting either a concerted methylation change associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or a clonal expansion of cells with abnormal hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
