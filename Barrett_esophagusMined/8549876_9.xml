<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> are present in up to 60% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002044'>Zollinger-Ellison syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ZES</z:e>), although esophageal function has been studied in only a few patients and the prevalence of Barrett's mucosa is unknown in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether the high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> is related to gastric acid hypersecretion alone or to abnormalities of esophageal motility or lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function in addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address these issues in the present study esophageal function was evaluated prospectively in 92 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ZES</z:e> (66 with active disease, 26 disease-free after curative resection) seen during a 1-year period after controlling acid hypersecretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients with active disease the mean basal acid output (BAO) was 33 +/- 3.0 mEq/h, the maximal acid output (MAO) was 56 +/- 4.0 mEg/h, fasting serum gastrin was 8,736 +/- 4,813 pg/ml and duration of disease prior to study was 12.5 +/- 2.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of manometry, gastric acid secretion was controlled in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and no patient had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> at upper gastrointestinal endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Esophageal manometry revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motility in 85% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven percent had low LES pressures, and only 1% of patients had an elevated LES pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of Barrett's mucosa (3%) was similar to that found in the general population but much less than that reported in patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was noted between LES pressures or manometric abnormalities and the fasting serum gastrin, BAO, MAO or the presence or absence of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0100568'>endocrine neoplasia</z:hpo> type I or previous vagotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Esophageal manometric results and LES pressure were similar in disease-free patients and those with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ZES</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results suggest that hypergastrinemia or other disease-specific abnormalities are not contributing to the high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ZES</z:e> because esophageal function in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ZES</z:e> is similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specifically, motility disorders in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ZES</z:e> occur in similar frequency to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, and LES pressure is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the high levels of acid secretion and prominence of symptoms, the occurrence of Barrett's mucosa was uncommon (3%) raising the possibility of additional protective mechanisms in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ZES</z:e> </plain></SENT>
