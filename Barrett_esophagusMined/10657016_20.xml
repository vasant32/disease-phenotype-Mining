<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Decision models for surveillance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) are governed by the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on endoscopic biopsy, but subjective grading is prone to observer variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computerized morphometry and immunoquantitation can objectively discriminate between different grades of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in oesophagectomy specimens with BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated the feasibility of such quantitative analysis on surveillance biopsies of BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy criteria for quantitative analysis were defined, excluding 101 (21%) of 472 archival BO surveillance biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) sections, 105 areas that distinctively displayed no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) were demarcated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Agreement on double-blind examination by two experienced pathologists was reached in 66 areas (63%; kappa: 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For 21 ND/LGD and 11 LGD/HGD disagreement areas, corresponding sections for p53 and Ki67 immunohistochemistry were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The best combination of two discriminating features was stratification index (SI) with p53 area % for ND versus LGD (89% correct classification), and SI with Ki67 area % for LGD versus HGD (91% correct classification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 21 ND/LGD disagreement areas could be classified uniquely as either ND or LGD by SI and p53, and eight of the 11 LGD/HGD disagreement areas as either LGD or HGD by SI and Ki67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlation coefficients for repeated measurements of SI, Ki67, and p53 by the same observer were 0.94, 0.92, and 0.86, and by two independent observers 0.86, 0.93, and 0.92, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Computerized quantitative pathology on BO surveillance biopsies is feasible provided that well-defined biopsy criteria are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of features associated with cellular differentiation and proliferation, such as SI, p53, and Ki67, quantitative pathological analysis assists in reducing diagnostic variability in the grading of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> during surveillance of BO </plain></SENT>
