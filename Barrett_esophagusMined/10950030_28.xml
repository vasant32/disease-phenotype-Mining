<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were: 1) to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) to that of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> who did not have BE; 2) to compare HRQL of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) patients to that of normative data for the US general population; and 3) to examine the impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptom frequency and severity on HRQL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The SF-36 and a validated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> questionnaire were administered to 107 patients with biopsy-proven BE and to 104 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> but no BE by endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequent symptoms were defined as symptoms that occurred at least once weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severity of symptoms was rated on a scale from 1 to 4 (mild to very severe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 85% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients and 82% of BE patients completed the questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the scores of the eight subscales of the SF-36 between BE patients and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> but without BE (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, both groups scored below average on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subscales of the SF-36 compared to published US norms for an age- and gender-matched group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using multivariable linear regression, the social functioning subscale of the SF-36 correlated with the presence of heartburn or acid regurgitation, severity of acid regurgitation, frequency of heartburn, frequency of acid regurgitation, and number of comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the physical functioning subscale correlated with age, frequency of heartburn, and number of comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The bodily pain subscale correlated with the frequency of heartburn and number of comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The bodily pain subscale correlated with the frequency of heartburn and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, whereas the role emotional subscale correlated with the frequency of heartburn and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although there were no differences in HRQL between BE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients, both groups scored below average on the subscales of the SF-36 compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptom frequency and severity were associated with bodily pain and with impaired social, emotional, and physical functioning, suggesting a profound impact on daily living </plain></SENT>
