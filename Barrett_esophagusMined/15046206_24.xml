<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reflux of gastric and duodenal contents is facilitated through the denervated stomach following esophagectomy, but the development of Barrett's changes in this model and the relationship to gastric and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To document the development of new Barrett's changes, i.e., columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) above the anastomosis, and relate this to the recovery of gastric acid production, acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e>, manometry, and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients at a median follow-up of 26 months (range = 12-67) postesophagectomy underwent endoscopy with biopsies taken 1-2 cm above the anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indication for esophagectomy had been <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 27), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 2), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137,C0751688" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous cell cancer</z:e> (n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>Physiology</z:mp> studies were performed in 27 patients and included manometry (n = 25), intraluminal gastric pH (n = 24), as well as simultaneous 24-hour esophageal pH (n = 27) and bile monitoring (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Duodenogastric reflux</z:e> increased over time, with differences between patients greater than and less than 3 years postesophagectomy for acid (p = 0.04) and bile (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (50%) developed columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and of these 13 had SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> did not relate to the magnitude of acid or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e>, to preoperative neoadjuvant therapies, or to the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of reflux was most significant, with increasing prevalence over time, with SIM in 13 patients at a median of 61 months postesophagectomy compared with 20 months in the 35 patients who were SIM-negative (p &lt; 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Supine reflux correlated with symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The development of Barrett's epithelium is frequent after esophagectomy, is time-related, reflecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> acid and bile exposure, and is not specific for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or the presence of previous Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This model may represent a useful in vivo model of the pathogenesis of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
