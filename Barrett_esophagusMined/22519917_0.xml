<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to characterize partial response to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> among adult patients in UK primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients aged 20-79 years who were prescribed <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were identified in The Health Improvement Network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those with a treatment change suggesting partial response to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> (new treatment added to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009141'>increased PPI</z:mp> dose, or switching <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) during the subsequent 6 months were identified as potential cases and confirmed after manual review of each patient's complete computer medical record including free-text comments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients without these treatment changes were study controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A nested case-control analysis was conducted using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with partial response to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy was 18.6% (1201/6453) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partial response was associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR]: 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.37), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.00-1.31), and prescription of â‰¥ 6 drugs in the month before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> diagnosis (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.14-1.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among new <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> users (n = 2907), partial response was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcer</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at initial diagnosis (OR: 3.14; 95% CI: 1.60-6.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one in five newly diagnosed patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> appear to have a partial response to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Female gender, polymedication, and a severe initial diagnosis may be associated with partial response </plain></SENT>
