<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>GOALS AND BACKGROUND: To assess whether prolonged use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori has adverse effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY: We studied 34 H. pylori-positive individuals with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nonulcer dyspepsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Half of them were on maintenance treatment with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> (mean, 8 years) and half were not.H. pylori and CagA status were tested serologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gastric biopsies were classified histopathologically by the updated Sydney classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">Proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> in H. pylori <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> are associated with significantly less antral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and lower H. pylori density, regardless of CagA status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency toward more antral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in patients with the CagA strain who were undergoing maintenance treatment with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> (p = 0.08), but there was an opposite tendency in CagA-negative individuals (p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was seen more frequently in CagA-positive, treated individuals (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that CagA status is important in the progression to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and that maintenance treatment with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> accelerate this progression, while reducing inflammatory infiltration </plain></SENT>
