<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: High-frequency catheter ultrasound (C-EUS) probes provide high resolution images of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their use in the esophagus is limited by the requirement for a water-filled lumen for good acoustical coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a system using a condom that provides a continuous column of water for high resolution C-EUS imaging of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients underwent condom C-EUS for evaluation of esophageal mucosal and submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A standard latex condom was attached to a 2-channel endoscope and filled with water after esophageal intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 20 MHz C-EUS probe placed within the water-filled condom was used to characterize <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The condom C-EUS system provided a 360 degree, high resolution image throughout the length of the esophagus without air artifact and without the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> associated with filling the esophageal lumen with water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete imaging of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, and no additional C-EUS procedures were required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The condom C-EUS was subjectively rated superior overall in comparison to standard C-EUS by 4 independent endosonographers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Condom C-EUS is a new method of high resolution imaging of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This method provides a contained column of water within the esophagus that improves image quality and ease of use and may reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
