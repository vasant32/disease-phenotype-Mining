<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at the gastro-oesophageal junction is on the increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> are usually diagnosed too late and thus have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only early diagnosis can improve the situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Classical Barrett oesophagus (length, &gt;3 cm) is a known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous condition</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is also specialized columnar epithelium (SCE) in the grossly unremarkable gastro-oesophageal transitional zone (short Barrett) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To determine the frequency of SCE, 370 patients were investigated by gastroscopy (OGD) consecutively between September 1995 and February 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Classical Barrett oesophagus was found to have an incidence of 4.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, microscopic evidence of SCE was observed in 13.6% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with short Barrett presented with reflux symptoms (odds ratio (OR), 4.7), irregular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e> serrata ('tongues') in the cardia (OR, 2.8), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e> significantly more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with reflux symptoms and concomitant 'tongues', however, had an OR of 13.16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Careful history-taking, together with a subtle histologic work-up of the gastro-oesophageal transitional zone can improve the rate of detecting patients with short Barrett </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with reflux symptoms and irregular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e> serrata should be selectively biopsied at the gastro-oesophageal junction, even when the latter presents a grossly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance, with the aim of detecting patients at risk of developing a Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
