<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The volume-outcome relationship for complex surgical procedures has been extensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most studies are based on administrative data and use in-hospital mortality as the sole outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is still unknown if concentration of these procedures leads to improvement of clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to audit the process and effect of centralizing oesophageal resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> by using detailed clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1990 until December 2004, 555 esophagectomies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were performed in 11 hospitals in the region of the Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center West (CCCW); 342 patients were operated on before and 213 patients after the introduction of a centralization project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this project patients were referred to the hospitals which showed superior outcomes in a regional audit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this audit patient, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and operative details as well as clinical outcome were compared between hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The outcome of both cohorts, patients operated on before and after the start of the project, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite the more severe comorbidity of the patient group, outcome improved after centralizing esophageal resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Along with a reduction in postoperative morbidity and length of stay, mortality fell from 12% to 4% and survival improved significantly (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hospitals with the highest procedural volume showed the biggest improvement in outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Volume is an important determinant of quality of care in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Referral of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> to surgical units with adequate experience and superior outcomes (outcome-based referral) improves quality of care </plain></SENT>
