<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Esophageal acid exposure is important in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), and possibly in the progression of BE to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to compare the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE patients treated with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> 2-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (H2RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed prospectively collected data by a single endoscopist on patients with BE in a VA (Veterans Affairs) setting over a 20-yr time period (1981-2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A pathologist used standard criteria to diagnose BE/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacy information after 1994 was retrieved from a computerized database, and from research files for the period before that </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The receipt and the duration of H2RA and/or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use was compared between those with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was examined in a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis stratified by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment status, and the risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was examined in a Cox multiple regression analysis controlling for demographic features, length of BE, and the year of BE diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We analyzed data for 236 unique veteran patients with a mean age at BE diagnosis of 61.5 yr, 86% Caucasian, and 98% male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During 1,170 patient-yr of follow-up, 56 patients developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> giving an annual incidence rate of 4.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of those, 14 had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was significantly lower among patients who received <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> after BE diagnosis than in those who received no therapy or H2RA; log rank test (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, among those on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>, a longer duration of use was associated with less frequent occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> after BE diagnosis was independently associated with reduced risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, hazards ratio: 0.25 (95% CI 0.13-0.47), p &lt; 0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Longer segments of BE and Caucasian race were other independent risk factors for developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In general, similar findings were observed when only cases with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, more studies are required to confirm this finding </plain></SENT>
