<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis, providing a quantitative estimate of the increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A search was conducted through four electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Current Contents Connect) to 4 April 2012, for observational studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using a random effects model for the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> with any length <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, as well as with short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>33 studies comprising 4390 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients were eligible for the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of any length (odds ratio 3.94; 95% confidence interval 3.02-5.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> was present (I2 = 82.03%, P &lt; 0.001), and the Egger test for publication bias was significant (P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> subgroup analysis likewise showed an increased risk (odds ratio 2.87; 95% confidence interval 1.75-4.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The strongest association was between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (odds ratio 12.67; 95% confidence interval 8.33-19.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increased risk was present even after adjusting for reflux and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:  The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, even after adjusting for clinically significant confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The strongest association was found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
