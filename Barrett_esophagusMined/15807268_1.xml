<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical, pathological features of severe reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (SRE) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and search for expression and significance of Ki-67 and COX-2 in their tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both SRE (n = 15) and BE (n = 25) cases were retrospectively analyzed for clinical manifestations, endoscopic findings and pathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of Ki-67 and COX-2 of esophageal epithelium in the two groups were compared with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal (NE) epithelium (n = 10) by immunoperoxidase staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was found that the positivity and staining intensity of Ki-67 expression in SRE and BE were higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium (P&lt;0.01), but there were no statistical differences between these two groups (P&gt;0.05); COX-2 was selectively expressed in some BE epithelium, but not in SRE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There were intensified Ki-67 expressions in the epithelium of SRE and BE, which could help us to evaluate the prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) patients clinically by surveillance of Ki-67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>COX-2 was selectively expressed in BE epithelium, so COX-2 inhibitors may have the potential for treatment of BE and for chemoprevention of its malignant change </plain></SENT>
