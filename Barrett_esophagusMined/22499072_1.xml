<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ex vivo pathologic diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0008012'>duodenal polyps</z:mp> causes time delay, requiring separate procedures for diagnosis and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It also involves small risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> in ampullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and can make subsequent endoscopic mucosal resection more difficult by "tacking down" mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo diagnosis with pCLE and NBI may avoid these complications and may guide immediate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY: During high-definition white light endoscopy, 1 endoscopist (M.B.W.) performed NBI and then, pCLE of duodenal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Matched tissue sampling or endoscopic mucosal resection was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Confocal videos were recorded, de-identified, and reviewed by same endoscopist, blinded to histopathology, 1 month later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Confocal features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> were applied for detection of duodenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 65 sites from 36 participants, 24 lesions showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, whereas 41 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and control sites were nondysplastic on histopathology, used as standard reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of pCLE were 83%, 92%, and 78%, whereas that of NBI were 80%, 83%, and 78%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In subset of 49 lesions with similar pCLE and NBI diagnosis, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, improved significantly and was found to be 92%, 95%, and 90%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pCLE has superior sensitivity as compared with NBI for detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:mp ids='MP_0008012'>duodenal polyps</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Combined accuracy of pCLE and NBI approaches that of ex vivo pathology, which may help in avoiding biopsy sampling </plain></SENT>
