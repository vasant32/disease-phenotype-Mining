<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of BE patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) is expected to reduce the risk of BEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed an immunohistochemical study to examine the formation of nitrative and oxidative DNA lesions, 8-nitroguanine and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxygaunosine (8-oxodG), in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal, BE with pre- and post-treatment by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> and BEA tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also observed the expression of an oxidant-generating enzyme (iNOS) and its transcription factor NF-ÎºB, an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme (Mn-SOD), its transcription factor (Nrf2) and an Nrf2 inhibitor (Keap1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity of DNA lesions was significantly higher in the order of BEA&gt;BE&gt;<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>iNOS expression was significantly higher in the order of BEA&gt;BE&gt;<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, while Mn-SOD expression was significantly lower in the order of BEA&lt;BE&lt;<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Mn-SOD expression and the nuclear localization of Nrf2 were significantly increased, and the formation of DNA lesions was significantly decreased in BE tissues after <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> treatment for 3-6months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Keap1 and iNOS expression was not significantly changed by the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> treatment in BE tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that 8-nitroguanine and 8-oxodG play a role in BE-derived BEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> treatment may trigger the activation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 resulting in the expression of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> genes, leading to DNA damage suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These DNA lesions can be useful biomarkers to predict both the risk of BEA and the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> treatment to prevent BEA in BE patients </plain></SENT>
