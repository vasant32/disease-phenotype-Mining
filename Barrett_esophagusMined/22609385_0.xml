<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although some studies have indicated that RFA is effective at eradicating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, most have found that RFA is not as effective in eradicating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether uncontrolled reflux is associated with persistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with BE underwent RFA, high-resolution manometry, and 24-hour impedance-pH testing; they received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients returned every 2 months for repeat treatment or standard surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as complete responders (CRs) if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was eradicated in fewer than 3 ablation sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analyzed clinical parameters to identify factors associated with a CR or incomplete responder (ICR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 37 patients, 22 had a CR and 15 had an ICR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mann-Whitney U tests revealed that length of BE, size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and frequency of reflux, but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, differed between CRs and ICRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CRs had fewer weakly acidic events than ICRs (29.5 vs 52; P &lt; .05) and total reflux events (33.5 vs 60; P &lt; .05), and a trend toward fewer weakly alkaline events (1.0 vs 5.0; P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No other clinical or manometric features differed between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Uncontrolled, predominantly weakly acidic reflux despite twice-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy before RFA increases the incidence of persistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> after ablation in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Length of BE and size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> also were associated with persistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> after RFA </plain></SENT>
