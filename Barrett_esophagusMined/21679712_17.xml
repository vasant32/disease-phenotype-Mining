<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed long-term rates of eradication, durability of neosquamous epithelium, disease progression, and safety of RFA in patients with dysplastic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a randomized trial of 127 subjects with dysplastic BE; after cross-over subjects were included, 119 received RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were followed for a mean time of 3.05 years; the study was extended to 5 years for patients with eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> after 2 and 3 years, durability of response, disease progression, and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 2 years, 101 of 106 patients had complete eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (95%) and 99 of 106 had eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2 years, among subjects with initial low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was eradicated in 51 of 52 (98%) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was eradicated in 51 of 52 (98%); among subjects with initial high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was eradicated in 50 of 54 (93%) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was eradicated in 48 of 54 (89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 3 years, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was eradicated in 55 of 56 of subjects (98%) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was eradicated in 51 of 56 (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> remained eradicated in &gt;85% of patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in &gt;75%, without maintenance RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 119 subjects (3.4%); the rate of stricture was 7.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was 1 per 181 patient-years (0.55%/patient-years); there was no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related morbidity or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The annual rate of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> was 1 per 73 patient-years (1.37%/patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with dysplastic BE, RFA therapy has an acceptable safety profile, is durable, and is associated with a low rate of disease progression, for up to 3 years </plain></SENT>
