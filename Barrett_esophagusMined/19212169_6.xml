<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: After a partial resection of the stomach, the continuity of the gastrointestinal tract can be restored either by a Billroth II gastrojejunal anastomosis or a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each procedure has its advantages and disadvantages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine through a prospective and random clinical trial, the clinical outcome and the endoscopic and histologic alterations of the distal esophagus and the gastric remnant in patients who received a partial distal gastrectomy due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo> and a Billroth II or Roux-en-Y reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective random trial, a total of 75 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A bilateral selective vagotomy and partial distal gastrectomy were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Billroth II or Roux-en-Y 60-cm-long loop was randomly used for reconstruction of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the latest follow-up clinical evaluation, upper endoscopy and biopsy samples from the distal esophagus and gastric remnant were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was 1 operative mortality and 6 patients had some morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up period was 15.5 years (range, 11-21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy were significantly more asymptomatic and had greater Visick I grading than patients with Billroth II reconstruction (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the distal esophagus, endoscopic findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 90% of the Roux-en-Y group, but only in 51% of the Billroth II group (P &lt; 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nearly 25% of the latter group had the appearance of a short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> compared with 3% of the Roux-en-Y group (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The gastric remnant endoscopic findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 100% of the Roux-en-Y group and in 18% of the Billroth II group (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Histologic analyses showed similar proportions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fundic mucosa and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active fundic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> atrophic fundic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were significantly more frequent after Billroth II reconstruction (P &lt; 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Helicobacter pylorus was present in a similar proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This prospective and random study showed that Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy is significantly better than a Billroth II reconstruction in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo>, through subjective and objective endoscopic and histologic evaluations during the latest follow-up evaluation </plain></SENT>
