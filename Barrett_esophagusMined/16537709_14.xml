<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It could be (a) DNA deletion, (b) LOH without copy number change, or (c) tetraploidy followed by genetic loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If an alternative biomarker assay, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), provided equivalent results, then translation to the clinic might be accelerated, because LOH genotyping is presently limited to research centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated mechanisms of TP53 LOH to determine if FISH and TP53 LOH provided equivalent results on the same flow-sorted samples (n = 43) representing established stages of clonal progression (diploid, diploid with TP53 LOH, aneuploid) in 19 esophagectomy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LOH developed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three mechanisms: 32% had DNA deletions, 32% had no copy number change, and 37% had FISH patterns consistent with a tetraploid intermediate followed by genetic loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, FISH and LOH are not equivalent (P &lt; 0.000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LOH develops by multiple chromosome mechanisms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which can be detected by genotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH cannot detect LOH without copy number change, and dual-probe FISH is required to detect the complex genetic changes associated with a tetraploid intermediate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternative biomarker assay development should be guided by appreciation and evaluation of the biological mechanisms generating the biomarker abnormality to detect potential sources of discordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FISH will require validation in adequately powered longitudinal studies before implementation as a clinical diagnostic for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> risk prediction </plain></SENT>
