<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms linking <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and progression of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of adipokines receptors in BE and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium in the same patients in correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: Expression of adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 protein (AdipoR1, AdipoR2) as well as leptin receptor protein (ObR) in biopsies from 27 BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium (N) in the same patients as well as in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were assessed with Western-blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These correlations were confirmed with the quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AdipoR1 and ObR protein levels were similar in BE mucosa and squamous epithelium in the same patients in Western-blot analysis (2303 vs. 2448 OB units; 106927 vs. 103390, respectively; p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR analysis confirmed this observation for AdipoR1, R2 and ObR genes expression (0.11±0.08 vs. 0.19±0.24, p=0.78; 0.24±0.36 vs. 0.33±0.49, p=0.5375; 0.71±0.8 vs. 1.33±2.95, p=1.0; respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using linear correlation analysis we found the positive correlation between AdipoR1 expression in Barrett's epithelium compared to squamous epithelium in the same patients (N) (r=0.5; p=0.008) and between ObR expression in BE and N (r=0.8; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The AdipoR1 and ObR protein levels were significantly higher in BE patients compared to controls and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> controls (2303 vs. 895 vs. 1674 and OD units, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: in opposite to the prior hypothesis adiponectin and leptin receptors activation in BE may be not caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
