<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess more accurately the incidence and types of p53 mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) with and without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, using pure preparations of epithelial cells obtained by laser capture microdissection (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assays were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antrum and premalignant and malignant esophageal samples from 57 patients, including 16 controls, 10 with BE <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> alone, 20 with BE-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 11 with BE-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> tissues were processed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from isolated cells, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using oligonucleutide primers for exons 5-8 of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR products were processed for DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p53 sequence abnormalities were identified in 2/16 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antrum and regenerative/chemical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, 1/10 cases of BE, 1/20 cases of BE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 2/11 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities occurred in exons 7 and 8 in the form of point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results, using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>, show that p53 gene mutations are relatively rare in esophageal preneoplastic and neoplastic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only point mutations were detected, but no deletions/insertions were identified </plain></SENT>
