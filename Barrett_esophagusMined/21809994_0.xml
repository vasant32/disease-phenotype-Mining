<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of IMP3 in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) and its precursor lesions including distinctive type Barrett mucosa (BM, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) and esophageal columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>) is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the patterns of IMP3 expression in EAC and its precursor lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Samples from 132 cases of EAC, 28 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> (16 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 12 low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> cases), 28 cases of BM without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 138 cases of nonneoplastic esophageal mucosa without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or BM within formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue microarray blocks were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissues were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-IMP3 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intensity (1-3+) and percent (0%-100%) of positive cytoplasmic and/or membranous IMP3 staining cells were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most of EAC cases (93 of 132; 70%) showed cytoplasmic and membranous IMP3 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Poorly and moderately differentiated EAC showed statistically significant higher IMP3 expression compared with well-differentiated EAC (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A subset of <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> cases (7 of 28; 25%) was positive for IMP3, including 3 low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> cases (focal 1+ IMP3 staining) and 4 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> cases (more diffuse 1-2+ IMP3 staining) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No IMP3 staining was observed in any nonneoplastic esophageal mucosa and BM tissues without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that IMP3 may play a role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of EAC and has diagnostic utility in differentiating neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
