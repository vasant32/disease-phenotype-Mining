<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was carried out in a large prospective series of 391 patients who had undergone upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the position of squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE) and its degree were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) in biopsy specimen was typed according to histochemistry and HE and alcian blue (pH2.5) staining separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results correlating with clinical, endoscopic, and pathological data were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of IM endoscopically appearing Long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> (LSBE) was 26.53%, Short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) was 33.85% and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) was 34.00% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IM increased with age of above 40 years old and no difference was found between male and female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve were diagnosed as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (7 low-grade, 5 high-grade), 16 were diagnosed as cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 1 as esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The more far away the SCJ moved upward above GEJ, the higher the prevalence and the more severe the RE were </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no difference of the prevalence of IM in different places of SCJ, and IM increased with age of above 40 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is important to pay attention to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the distal esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is more common in cardia than in esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BE is a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
