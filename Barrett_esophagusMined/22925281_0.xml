<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Endoscopic diagnosis of the lateral extension of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> under the squamous epithelium (BCUS) is sometimes difficult because the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is unobservable in the esophageal lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to clarify the endoscopic features of the extension of BCUS and verify the usefulness of the <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>-spraying method (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e>) for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 25 patients with Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> who had undergone endoscopic resection were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of patients' resected specimens was performed to identify the presence of BCUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, the endoscopic images of the BCUS cases were reviewed to summarize the findings and to evaluate the feasibility of diagnosing the extent of BCUS with each imaging technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 25 patients, 10 (40%) had BCUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With white-light imaging, subtle reddish change was observed in the area of BCUS in 80% of the patients, and a flat elevated lesion was recognized in 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With narrow band imaging, slight brownish change was observed in the area of BCUS in 86% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Slight white changes were visualized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extension of BCUS was correctly diagnosed by white-light imaging, narrow band imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> in 50%, 43% and 100% of the cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histology verified the opening of cancerous glands, which extended under the squamous epithelium, into the esophagus in the area showing slight white changes by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> can be useful for diagnosing the extension of BCUS </plain></SENT>
