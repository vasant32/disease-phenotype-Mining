<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate prospectively the accuracy of preoperative high-frequency (20 MHz) probe ultrasonography (HFPUS) for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> in patients referred for esophagectomy because of an endoscopic biopsy diagnosis of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (ICA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine consecutive male patients (median age of 69 yr) who were referred for esophagectomy for HGD or ICA in BE agreed to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed conventional upper gastrointestinal endoscopy followed by HFPUS using a through-the-scope ultrasound probe (20 MHz), and we compared our preoperative findings with the pathologist's findings in the resected esophageal specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was complete agreement between the postoperative pathological findings and the preoperative HFPUS findings in only 4 of the 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HFPUS resulted in two false-negative diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> (both had T1 lesions in the resected specimens), one false-positive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, and two errors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging (1 understaged, 1 overstaged) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HFPUS has limited accuracy for identifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> in patients found to have HGD or IMC in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pending further refinements in technology, clinical management decisions in such patients should not be based solely on the results of HFPUS </plain></SENT>
