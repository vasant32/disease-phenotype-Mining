<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of antireflux procedures in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> on the regression of columnar epithelium and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and its potential protective effect on the subsequent development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 241 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> treated at the Lahey Clinic from 1973 to 1989, 37 patients underwent an antireflux operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regression was defined as histological evidence of regenerating squamous mucosa that completely or partially replaced the columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Improvement in lower esophageal sphincter pressure to 12 mm Hg or greater occurred in 19 of 26 patients (73%) who had perioperative manometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic relief of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> occurred in 34 of 37 patients (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had partial regression with regenerating squamous mucosa juxtaposed with areas of columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinoma</z:mp> developed in 3 of 37 patients (8.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had recurrence of severe symptoms of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> before development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who have undergone a successful antireflux operation with symptomatic relief and evidence of improvement in lower esophageal sphincter pressures rarely show regression of Barrett's mucosa and may still be at risk for development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the indications for antireflux operation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> should remain the same as for other patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, but yearly endoscopic and histological surveillance should be continued postoperatively </plain></SENT>
