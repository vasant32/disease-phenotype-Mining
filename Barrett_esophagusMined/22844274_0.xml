<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two main nonsurgical endoscopic approaches for ablating dysplastic and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> lesions in the esophagus have gained popularity, namely, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryospray ablation (CSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a uniquely suited endoscopic and near-microscopic imaging modality, three-dimensional (3D) optical coherence tomography (OCT), to assess and compare the esophagus immediately after RFA and CSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximum depths of architectural changes were measured and compared between the two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RFA was observed to induce 230~260 μm depth of architectural changes after each set of ablations over a particular region, while CSA was observed to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>-like spongiform changes to ~640 μm depth within the ablated field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability to obtain micron-scale depth-resolved images of tissue structural changes following different ablation therapies makes 3D-OCT an ideal tool to assess treatment efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such information could be potentially used to provide real-time feedback for treatment dosing and to identify regions that need further retreatment </plain></SENT>
