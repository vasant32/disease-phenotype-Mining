<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) appears to be effective in the eradication of nondysplastic Barrett's mucosa, but no results are available in the management of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> complicating BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our initial experience in the application of APC in this indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients (mean age 74.2) with histologically proven HGD (n = 7) or in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 3) associated with BE (mean length 6 cm) and unfit for surgery were treated using APC and high-dose <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (40 mg daily) until squamous re-epithelialization or complete eradication of the initially apparent lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic follow-up was maintained at every 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete eradication of HGD and in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was achieved after a mean number of 3.3+/-1.5 APC sessions in 8/10 patients (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The eight patients with complete clearance of the neoplastic areas did not show any evidence of local recurrence during a median follow-up of 24 months (range 12-36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with initial HGD had persistence of HGD 30 months after initial diagnosis, and one patient progressed to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> after failure of APC and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: APC is safe and effective in the management of HGD and in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> associated with BE, and might represent an interesting alternative in selected patients who are not candidates for surgery </plain></SENT>
