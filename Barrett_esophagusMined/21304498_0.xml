<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have demonstrated high esophageal eosinophil counts in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> similar to eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EoE) yet the frequency of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the prevalence of dense esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> as a manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Mayo Clinic pathology database was reviewed for patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> from January to December 2008 with squamous mucosa obtained during endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical, endoscopic, and histologic findings were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with ≥15 eosinophils per high powered field were identified and compared to those without esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and squamous tissue obtained at the time of biopsy were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 200 patients (7%) had ≥15 eosinophils per high powered field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Demographics, symptoms, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapies were similar between those with and without esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic features suggestive of EoE were found in the squamous mucosa of 2 patients with and 7 patients without esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of photodynamic, radiofrequency ablation, or monopolar electrocoagulation therapy for ablation of Barrett's mucosa was not associated with a higher rate of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_152'>Basal cell hyperplasia</z:mpath>, papillary elongation, and spongiosis occurred frequently in association with esophageal eosinophilic infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High esophageal eosinophil counts were found in 7% of this cohort of 200 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and likely underestimates prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The finding of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> in this cohort was independent of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> use, features of EoE, or endoscopic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to assess if these findings are applicable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
