<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BE is a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anatomical abnormalities of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) are an important factor in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the prevalence of BE in Turkey, which is geographically located between Europe and Asia, and to investigate the frequency of BE according to the degree of anatomical disruption in the EGJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This prospective study was performed on 1000 consecutive patients referred for endoscopy for any clinical indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a structured interview that assessed major symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (regurgitation and heartburn) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BE was diagnosed when specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was detected histologically in the esophageal biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopically assessed integrity of the EGJ was classified as one of three types, as follows: 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> EGJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The endoscope shaft was gripped tightly by the cardia in retroflexed endoscopy, or it was gripped less tightly but the cardia was seen to open and close with respiration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2 Widened EGJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cardia was open during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phases of respiration in retroflexed endoscopy, but there was no endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (HH) on the antegrade view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>3 HH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The axial length from the EGJ to the diaphragmatic hiatus was at least 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BE was found in 12 patients (1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> EGJ was seen in 90.7% of patients, widened EGJ in 4.3%, and HH in 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with widened EGJ had a significantly higher incidence of major reflux symptoms and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> compared with those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EGJ (P= 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>BE was found in 14% of patients with HH and in 0.5% of patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EGJ (P= 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with widened EGJ had BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In terms of BE frequency, these patients did not differ significantly from those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EGJ (P= 0.793) but did differ significantly from those with HH (P= 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BE was 1.2% in a Turkish population undergoing endoscopy for any reason </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In terms of EGJ integrity, comparison of the groups showed that even in the absence of HH, patients with widening of the EGJ had an increased prevalence of major reflux symptoms and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, histologically confirmed BE was not seen among patients with widened EGJ </plain></SENT>
