<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In comparison with open procedures, laparoscopic antireflux surgery has a lower morbidity rate, a better early and late postoperative outcome and is more cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antireflux surgery can be performed after a critical evalutation of the patient including gastroscopy, biopsy, 24h-pH-manometry and after a long lasting conservative medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications for antireflux surgery are given by a failed medical treatment, an insufficient compliance, complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, i.e. stenosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett-esophagus</z:hpo> and atypical reflux symptoms like <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cough, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarseness</z:hpo> or thoracic pain with presence of a pathological pH-monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic 360 degrees Nissen-fundoplication with crurorrhaphy is our standard procedure, whereas the 270 degrees Toupet technique in our tailored approach is the technique of choice for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal motility disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
