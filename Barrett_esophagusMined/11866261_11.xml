<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development stage of BE is not well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological evidence indicates that the columnar epithelium in BE is acquired and reaches its full length rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that BE might result from direct replacement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> in reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: At endoscopy, we compared the length and distribution of esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> in 50 patients with RE with the length and distribution of columnar epithelium in 50 patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median length of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> in RE was 2 cm, less than the median length of columnar epithelium in BE, 5 cm (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>Erosions</z:mpath> in RE were usually multiple and scattered, involving the entire circumference of the esophagus in only 10% of cases, but circumferential involvement by columnar epithelium was found in 68% of BE cases (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Circumferential involvement, 3 cm or longer, was found in 0% of cases of RE versus 56% of BE cases (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients without RE or BE had large areas of epithelial loss of uncertain etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The length and distribution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> in RE differ greatly from the length and distribution of columnar epithelium in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that BE arises directly from areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that BE may develop after loss of a long segment of squamous epithelium, with columnar replacement in the presence of continuing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
