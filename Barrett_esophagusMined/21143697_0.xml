<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective in this study was to develop an optimized ex vivo biopsy culture technique to study the molecular signaling events induced after insult with individual refluxate constituents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We illustrate the utility of this method by showing results for NF-kB centered cell signaling, and compare the results with those obtained from esophageal cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that upregulation of the two NF-kB target genes show differences in pH preference, with IL-8 being preferentially upregulated by DCA at neutral pH, and IkB being upregulated by neutral DCA, acidic DCA, and acid alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was found to be true in both cell lines and biopsy cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum responses were noted in both models when mixed reflux (DCA at pH 6) was utilized, perhaps reflecting the pH preference of DCA (pKa 6.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the optimized ex vivo models, and the in vitro cell lines show that bile and acid are capable of inducing NF-kB dependent gene expression, with some interesting differences in preferred transcriptional target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in both cells and cultured biopsies, similar reflux driven gene expression changes were noted, with maximum effects noted with DCA exposures at pH 6 </plain></SENT>
