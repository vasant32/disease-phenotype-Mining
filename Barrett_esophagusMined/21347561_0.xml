<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) displays familial aggregation, known as familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (FBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pedigrees and characteristics of EAC in these families have been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We aimed to evaluate endoscopic and clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in FBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 979 BE patients were retrospectively evaluated for FBE, defined as having a first-degree relative with BE or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, confirmed when possible by interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FBE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> BE were compared regarding demographic, clinical, and endoscopic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Potential FBE probands were contacted and interviewed to obtain full family pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 603 BE probands (61.6% of total cohort) with a documented family history, 35 (5.8%) had FBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between FBE and non-FBE probands with regard to BE length (median: 3 cm, IQR 2-5 vs. 3 cm, IQR 1-6 cm, respectively; p = 0.78) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> size (p = 0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FBE probands were younger (mean, 58.4 vs. 63.8; p = 0.02) and had a significant association with less-advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no obvious association between FBE and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in endoscopic characteristics between FBE and non-FBE probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While FBE patients were younger and had less-advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, we speculate that these findings may have been the result of more aggressive screening due to the family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to determine whether familial clustering is due to genetic predisposition to development of BE or to risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
