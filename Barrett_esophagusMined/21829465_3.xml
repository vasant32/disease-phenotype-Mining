<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) has become a major concern in Western countries due to rapid rises in incidence coupled with very poor survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the key risk factors for the development of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), which is believed to form in response to repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we performed comparative, genome-wide expression profiling (using Illumina whole-genome Beadarrays) on total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted from esophageal biopsy tissues from individuals with EAC, BE (in the absence of EAC) and those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We combined these data with publically accessible raw data from three similar studies to investigate key gene and ontology differences between these three tissue states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results support the deduction that BE is a tissue with enhanced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> synthesis machinery (DPP4, ATP2A3, AGR2) designed to provide strong mucosal defenses aimed at resisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EAC exhibits the enhanced extracellular matrix remodeling (collagens, IGFBP7, PLAU) effects expected in an aggressive form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, as well as evidence of reduced expression of genes associated with mucosal (MUC6, CA2, TFF1) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi> (AKR1C2, AKR1B10) defenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When our results are compared to previous whole-genome expression profiling studies keratin, mucin, annexin and trefoil factor gene groups are the most frequently represented differentially expressed gene families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven genes identified here are also represented in at least 3 other profiling studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We used these genes to discriminate between squamous epithelium, BE and EAC within the two largest cohorts using a support vector machine leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While this method was satisfactory for discriminating squamous epithelium and BE, it demonstrates the need for more detailed investigations into profiling changes between BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
