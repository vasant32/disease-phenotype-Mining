<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Unsedated transnasal endoscopy (TNE) may be safer and less expensive than standard endoscopy (SE) for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emerging technologies require robust evaluation before routine use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and acceptability of TNE in diagnosing BE compared with those of SE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, crossover study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single, tertiary-care referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study enrolled consecutive patients with BE or those referred for diagnostic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent TNE followed by SE or the reverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spielberger State-Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory short-form questionnaires, a visual analogue scale, and a single question addressing preference for endoscopy type were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Diagnostic accuracy and tolerability of TNE were compared with those of SE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 95 patients randomized, 82 completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We correctly diagnosed 48 of 49 BE cases by TNE for endoscopic findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> compared with the criterion standard, SE, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 0.98 and 1.00, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The BE median length was 3 cm (interquartile range [IQR] 1-5 cm) with SE and 3 cm (IQR 2-4 cm) with TNE, giving high correlations between the two modalities (R(2) = 0.97; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity for detecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> by TNE compared with those by SE was 0.91 and 1.00, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean (± standard deviation) post-endoscopy Spielberger State-Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory short-form score for TNE (30.0 ± 1.10 standard error of the mean [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>]) was lower than that for SE (30.7 ± 1.29 SEM), (P = .054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The visual analogue scale scores were no different (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (59%) expressed a preference for TNE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This is a small study, with limited generalizability, a high prevalence of patients with BE, differential drop-out between the two procedures, and use of sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TNE is an accurate and well-tolerated method for diagnosing BE compared with SE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>TNE warrants further evaluation as a screening tool for BE </plain></SENT>
