<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> develops with the following 2 distinct types of lining mucosa: with and without specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Goblet cells found only in SIM areas identify an intestinal phenotype, recognized as the histological hallmark diagnosing Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, and selecting high-risk patients for endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The columnar non-goblet cells are the major component of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> Barrett's metaplastic cell population and are present in areas either with or without SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their significance in the differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e>, and their relationship to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This immunohistochemical study used two markers of enterocytic differentiation, to explore the intestinal phenotype of the non-goblet cell population of Barrett's epithelium and Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and dipeptidilpeptidase IV (DPP) immunoexpression was assessed in paraffin-embedded samples of 12 surgical specimens containing Barrett's esophageal mucosa in association with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>/high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ileal mucosa and mucosa from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric and esophageal segments of the surgical specimen were used as positive and negative controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SI and DPP were expressed by the neoplastic cells and the columnar non-goblet, being negative in goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The localization of the enzymes was predominantly apical for SI and cytoplasmatic for DPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was immunoreactivity for SI in 58.3% of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and in 66.6% of Barrett's mucosa, with equal frequency in areas with and without SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DPP was identified in 66.6% of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, in 50% of the cases of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> with SIM, and in 75% of those without SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The columnar non-goblet cell components of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> contain small intestine enzymes in the areas either with or without SIM, which suggests that they identify an "incomplete form" of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The demonstration that the two enzymes, SI and DPP, are produced by the columnar non-goblet cell metaplastic population and by the neoplastic cells of the associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, indicates that, in addition to the goblet cells, the non-goblet elements may also be involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
