<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The histological definition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is debated, particularly regarding the phenotype of its metaplastic columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologically proven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) was the sine qua non condition for a diagnosis of BE but, more recently, non-intestinalized (i.e., cardiac gastric-type; GM) columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> has been re-included in the spectrum of Barrett's histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs modulate cell commitment, and are also reportedly dysregulated in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigates miRNA expression in the histological spectrum of esophageal columnar metaplastic changes, specifically addressing the biological profile of GM vs. IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A study was performed to discover microRNA microarray in 30 matching mucosa samples obtained from 10 consecutive BE patients; for each patient, biopsy tissue samples were obtained from squamous, GM and intestinalized epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microarray findings were further validated by qRT-PCR analysis in another bioptic series of 75 mucosa samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MicroRNA profiling consistently disclosed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-specific microRNA signatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six microRNAs were significantly dysregulated across the histological phenotypes considered; five of them (two overexpressed (hsa-miR-192; -miR-215) and three under-expressed (hsa-miR-18a*; -miR-203, and -miR-205)) were progressively dysregulated in the phenotypic sequence from squamous to gastric-type, to intestinal-type mucosa samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A consistent microRNA expression signature underlies both gastric- and intestinal-type esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pattern of microRNA dysregulation suggests that GM may further progress to IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinico-pathological implications of these molecular profiles prompt further study on the "personalized" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk associated with each of these metaplastic transformations </plain></SENT>
