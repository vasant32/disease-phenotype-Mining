<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Induction chemotherapy has become an accepted choice for the treatment of locally advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that early assessment of metabolic response using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography predicts response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolic response has also been revealed to be an independent prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surgical risk and outcome in metabolic responders were compared with those in nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study design predefined a 12-week multicourse preoperative chemotherapy regimen in metabolic responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, chemotherapy was stopped after a 2-week induction period in metabolic nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were scheduled for surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 110 evaluable patients, 50 metabolic responders and 54 nonresponders underwent resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications occurred in 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (1.8%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between responders and nonresponders in terms of postoperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Major histologic remissions were seen in 58% of metabolic responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Metabolic responders had an increased chance of having an R0 resection (96% vs. 74%; P=0.002) and a decreased risk of developing hematogenous or distant lymphatic recurrence (32% vs. 54%, P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This translated into better recurrence-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Induction chemotherapy and early metabolic response assessment is a new concept in the treatment of locally advanced Barrett <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Metabolic responders undergoing multicourse preoperative chemotherapy have a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The best treatment strategy for nonresponders remains to be defined </plain></SENT>
