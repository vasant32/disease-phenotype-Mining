<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment complications, risk of recurrence, and buried <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of diode laser treatment on BE, studied in a group of patients over a long-term period, is presented here </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment sessions were carried out every 3 months and bioptic follow-up examinations were done yearly </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 20 patients with IM, four of them with LGD, were treated with 161 laser sessions (in mean eight per patient) without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete, sustained endoscopic and histologic remission was obtained in 13 patients (11/12 with BE ≤ 3 cm and 2/8 with BE &gt;3 cm, p &lt; 0.01) and a mean of 83 ± 27% of the metaplasic tissue was removed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diode laser ablation is a safe and effective method in most cases of short BE, while it is less effective in the long form, requiring a large number of sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term results show that the risk of recurrence and of buried <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> underneath neosquamous epithelium is negligible </plain></SENT>
