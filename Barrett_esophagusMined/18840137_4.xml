<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to compare intracellular acid loading in BE cells with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary squamous and BE cells were obtained endoscopically and cultured for up to 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines TE7 and OE-33 were compared with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal (NE) cell line OE-21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extracellular pH was lowered to 6.0 using HCl; specific ion exchangers were blocked pharmacologically and pH microfluorimetry was performed using 2'7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of prolonged acid preincubations and repeated acid exposure on acid loading and recovery were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Acid loading was greater in primary BE than NE cells (DeltapHi -0.22 +/- 0.08 vs.-0.13 +/- 0.01) and maximal in the BE <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line TE7 (DeltapHi -0.30 +/- 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas TE7 cells were able to recover fully from repeated acid exposure, OE-21 cells remained profoundly acidic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BE primary and transformed cells utilize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4286">DIDS</z:chebi> inhibitable <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-independent <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>/bicarbonate exchange as well as <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>/hydrogen ion exchange for acid loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SE only requires <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-independent <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>/bicarbonate exchange for acidification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The degree of acid loading is greater in BE than NE cells and it occurs via dual ion exchangers similar to gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only Barrett's epithelial cells can maintain a physiological pHi following prolonged and repeated reflux exposure, which may confer a teleological advantage </plain></SENT>
