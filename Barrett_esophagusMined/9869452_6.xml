<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The identification of markers that distinguish primary pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> from pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> secondary to the digestive tract would be clinically important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Villin, a specific marker in digestive-tract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, was evaluated in 57 pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, six samples of proximal bronchial tissue, and five metastatic pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (three colon and two esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>) by using immunohistochemical and molecular analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Villin was expressed in 31.6% (18 of 57) of the pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and showed either a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern (10.5%) or a primary cytoplasmic pattern with minor brush-border staining (21.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, none of those samples demonstrated the primary brush-border staining pattern that was characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five of the metastatic digestive-tract <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the positive brush-border staining pattern between the primary and metastatic pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Villin protein was expressed in bronchial epithelial cells, and villin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Northern analysis demonstrated 3.5- and 2.7-kb villin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in villin protein-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, but villin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was not detected in non-tumorous lung tissue, indicating the transcriptional upregulation of villin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An additional smaller-sized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (1.8 kb) was observed in six of 10 pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and in the bronchoalveolar <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line A549 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two small villin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were cloned from the cell line A549 and were found to represent an alternatively spliced (exon 8-exon 14) 1.85-kb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and a 1.8-kb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> that was missing a portion of the 5' region (exon 1-exon 9) of the native villin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrated that the pattern of villin expression and the presence of altered villin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> may be useful markers for pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> as well as provide support for the potential origin of villin-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from bronchial epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
