<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The following epidemiologic data were used: total population figures, the prevalence and incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and its complications, and data on patients with poorly treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, as well as data on treatment costs and active workers' presenteeism and absenteeism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data were used to calculate the economic consequences arising from the population with poorly treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> for the healthcare system and employers in each country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The size of the population with poorly treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was estimated to be 29,678 in Spain, 19,327 in Germany and 10,079 in Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Costs for the healthcare systems in Spain, Germany and Italy for the population with poorly treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were estimated to be €18, 12 and 7 million, respectively, for each country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total costs for absenteeism and presenteeism for employers due to poorly treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were €10 million for Germany, €1 million for Italy and none for Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Costs due to poorly treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> represent a substantial burden for the healthcare systems of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three studied countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Costs for employers owing to absenteeism or presenteeism of employees were low or no costs were found </plain></SENT>
