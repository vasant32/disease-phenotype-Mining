<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the current study we aimed to clarify the potential of EpCAM and villin as in vivo biomarkers for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE)-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and BE versus cardiac mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining in BE with various degrees of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (IN), Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (BC) and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac mucosa (CM) revealed a lack of EpCam and villin in squamous esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> specimens of IN and BC showed EpCam with varying staining intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 57% of CM samples a weak signal was detected; the remainder displayed strong EpCam expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Villin was found in 97% of BE specimens and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those with IN; 37% of BC and 75% of CM specimens were~also positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that expression of EpCam and villin differs only between squamous epithelium and BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Determination of these proteins does not allow discrimination between different degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> or between esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and cardiac mucosa </plain></SENT>
