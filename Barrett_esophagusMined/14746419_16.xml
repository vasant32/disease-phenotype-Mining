<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most prior studies have been retrospective or screened only a selected population of patients with small bowel biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To more accurately define the true prevalence of this disorder in patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> (with or without stool hemoccult positivity), we initiated this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with small bowel biopsies and colonoscopy were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> patients (including those with hemoccult-positive stools) referred to the gastroenterology service during a 2-year period (1998-2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> as defined by a serum ferritin &lt; 25 ng/ml and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> &lt; 12 g/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded for documented prior erosive, ulcerative, or malignant disease of the gastrointestinal tract, previous gastrointestinal surgery, overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> within the past 3 months, or inability to access the duodenum for biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent upper endoscopy with more than two biopsies of the distal duodenum and colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A serum immunoglobulin A antiendomysial antibody test was to be performed in those patients with a positive small bowel biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred five of 139 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven men (mean age, 51.6 yr) and 48 women (mean age, 54.1 yr) constituted the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The demographics of this study population included 36 blacks, 38 Hispanics, and 22 whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were of mixed or unknown ethnic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Forty-three and eight-tenths percent of the men and 37.5% of women had hemoccult-positive stools, accounting for a total of 40.9% of the study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Upper endoscopic findings included <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> in 22.8%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcers</z:hpo> in 9.5%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenitis</z:e> in 8.5%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 7.6%, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in 2.8%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo> in 2.8%, gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> in 2.8%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> in 2.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopic findings included <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colon polyps</z:mp> in 21.9%, diverticula in 10.4%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> in 16.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Multiple findings were found in 32.3% of patients, and there were no findings in 28.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> in this prospective study of patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> was 2.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A significant number of other gastrointestinal lesions amenable to therapy were also found on upper and lower endoscopy in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Given the treatable nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo>, it should be screened for in patients with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> with or without hemoccult-positive stools </plain></SENT>
