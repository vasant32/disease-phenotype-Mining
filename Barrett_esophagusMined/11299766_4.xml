<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Samples of metaplastic specialised epithelium (SE; n = 28), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD; n = 21), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD; n = 19) and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (CA; n = 35) derived from 36 oesophagectomy specimens were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the cases that were informative for the RB gene (n = 27), loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in none of the 22 SE, in none of the 14 LGD, in 1 of the 12 HGD (8.3%) and in 5 of the 27 CA (18.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, an enhanced expression of pRb protein in LGD, HGD and CA as compared with SE was found in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> samples, however, a marked reduction (3 cases) or complete absence (1 case) of pRb protein expression was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two out of these 4 CA samples showed LOH in the RB gene whilst one case was heterozygous and one case was homozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the positive controls used, CDK4 amplification was not detectable by means of differential PCR in any of the samples under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study indicated that allelic loss of the RB gene occurs late in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>--<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>--<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence in BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically determined loss of pRb protein expression may indicate LOH of the RB gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CDK4 gene amplification does not seem to play a role in the development of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
