<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is a major risk factor for both BE and EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary purposes of this study were to determine whether circulating levels of leptin and adiponectin, both of which are deregulated in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> states, predict risk of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) occurring in the esophagus (BE) and/or gastroesophageal junction, and evaluate the extent to which they mediate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case-control study, 177 persons newly diagnosed with SIM were compared with 173 general population controls using unconditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Females in the highest tertiles of BMI and waist circumference were at the greatest risk (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 4.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9, 11.6), P(trend) = 0.002; OR = 5.1 (95% CI = 2.0, 13.0), P(trend) = 0.002, respectively) compared to females in the lowest tertiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for leptin and adiponectin attenuated these associations by 52 and 42%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Males in the highest tertile of waist-to-hip ratio were at the greatest risk (adjusted OR = 2.8 (95% CI = 1.3, 5.9), P(trend) = 0.014) compared to males in the lowest tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, adjustment for leptin and adiponectin did not attenuate these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study results are consistent with the notion that circulating leptin and adiponectin partially mediate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-BE relationship in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Leptin and adiponectin's role in the progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelium to SIM/BE and on to EA should be further elucidated </plain></SENT>
