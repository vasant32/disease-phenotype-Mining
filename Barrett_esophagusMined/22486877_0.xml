<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Endoscopic definitions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) vary among countries, mainly because of the difficulty in diagnosing short-segment BE (SSBE) endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether the endoscopic identification of squamous islands and the specific position of columnar epithelium helps improve the diagnosis of SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: First, we prospectively enrolled 100 consecutive patients with SSBE and evaluated the number of identified squamous islands in the columnar epithelium with different modalities: white light (WL), narrow band imaging (NBI), and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, in another group of 100 consecutive patients with tongue-like SSBE, the correlation of the location of Barrett's mucosa to the esophageal longitudinal folds (ridge or valley) was evaluated endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was possible to detect squamous islands in 48, 71, and 75 patients by WL, NBI, and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detection rate of squamous islands by NBI or <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy was significantly superior to that by WL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tongue-like SSBEs were predominantly found on the ridge of mucosal folds (71%), similar to the location of mucosal breaks (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Squamous islands in the columnar epithelium were efficiently observed by NBI or <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SSBE was found more frequently on the ridges but not in the valleys of esophageal longitudinal mucosal folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NBI endoscopic observation focusing on columnar epithelium with squamous islands on the ridges of distal esophageal folds may improve endoscopic detection of SSBE </plain></SENT>
