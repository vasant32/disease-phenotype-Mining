<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence and incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in short segment and traditional long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-four patients with short segment Barrett's and 78 with traditional Barrett's entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age or gender between the two groups of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A greater percentage of patients with short segment barrett's were black (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at diagnosis in patients with short segment Barrett's was 8.1% versus 24.4% in patients with traditional Barrett's (p &lt; 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was noted at diagnosis only in patients with traditional Barrett's (p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients with short segment Barrett's and 29 with traditional Barrett's were followed prospectively for 12-40 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> developed during follow-up in two patients with short segment Barrett's and in six patients with traditional Barrett's (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> developed in any patients with short segment Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> did develop in two patients with traditional <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> developed in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on the latest surveillance examination continued to be significantly higher for patients with traditional Barrett's (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up surveillance biopsy specimens of Barrett's mucosa frequently demonstrated an absence of goblet cells in patients with short segment Barrett's compared with patients with traditional Barrett's (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with traditional <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are significantly higher than in patients with short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further prospective surveillance is required to determine whether the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients with short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is significantly lower </plain></SENT>
