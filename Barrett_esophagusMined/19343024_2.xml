<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The view that specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with goblet cells is the predominant preneoplastic phenotype has had wide, but by no means universal, acceptance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An important caveat is presented in the thoughtful paper by Liu et al. in this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 68 patients with columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, 22 patients had no goblet cells identified and 46 had goblet cells in their biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both groups there were chromosomal and DNA content abnormalities and genetic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences between these cellular DNA abnormalities in the two groups </plain></SENT>
