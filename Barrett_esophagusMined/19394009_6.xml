<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Autofluorescence imaging is a novel imaging technique that may improve the detection of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autofluorescence imaging is, however, associated with a 40% to 81% false-positive rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to identify endoscopic features that may predict the presence of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in autofluorescence-positive areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Descriptive and prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary referral centers for the detection and treatment of early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing autofluorescence endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-quality images with autofluorescence imaging and white-light endoscopy were obtained with corresponding histologic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A systematic image evaluation process was performed, including an unblinded orientation phase (10 areas), a blinded derivation phase, and a blinded validation phase by 5 international experts in autofluorescence imaging (80 areas) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequently the identified features were validated in a prospective pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Association between endoscopic features and presence of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in autofluorescence-positive areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Autofluorescence intensity, proximity of gastric folds &lt;1 cm, and different appearance on white-light endoscopy were independently associated with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in autofluorescence-positive areas on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The kappa values for interobserver agreement of these factors were moderate, ranging between 0.49 to 0.56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The association with autofluorescence intensity and different appearance on white-light endoscopy was confirmed in a prospective pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: Selected set of images from a high-risk population (tertiary referral center) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found specific endoscopic features that were associated with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in autofluorescence-positive areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings can be used in future prospective studies to improve the accuracy of autofluorescence imaging without performing magnification endoscopy for detailed inspection of suspicious areas </plain></SENT>
