<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: Previous studies have demonstrated an improved prognosis in patients with Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> as compared with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> without Barrett </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that an earlier presentation due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) may lead to detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at an earlier stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The records of 178 patients with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> presenting to Roswell Park <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute (Buffalo, NY) between 1991 and 1996 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The clinical presentation, work-up, therapy, and outcome were compared between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 66) and those without endoscopic or pathologic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 112) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were several favorable prognostic signs in the Barrett group, including smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, lower grade, and earlier stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More patients in the Barrett group had surgically resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, resulting in an improved overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there were no differences in the type or duration of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, very few patients presented because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, and only slightly more in the Barrett group (14% vs 4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While survival greatly improved in patients diagnosed with Barrett due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, this did not account for the difference in prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Improved prognosis and survival for the Barrett group is not due to earlier presentation due to symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is more likely that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arises from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and that it is obscured by larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reviews limited to resected patients greatly overestimate the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cases diagnosed due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased efforts to identify high-risk patients and initiate screening are necessary to diagnose <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at an earlier stage </plain></SENT>
