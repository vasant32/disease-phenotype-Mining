<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The frequency of progression from low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) to high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (HGD/ CA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) varies among studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current assessment is made more difficult because of pathologists' interobserver variability in diagnosing LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently conducted an interobserver study on LGD and reported a positive correlation between the extent of agreement among GI pathologists and progression of LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we analyzed the immunohistochemical staining for p53 in patients diagnosed with LGD with known clinical outcome and interobserver agreement data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fixed, paraffin-embedded endoscopic biopsy specimens from 16 patients diagnosed with LGD in BE were immunostained for p53 (DO-7, Dako, Carpinteria, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained and immunostained sections were examined in tandem to determine whether the LGD areas in question stained for p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The p53 immunoreactivity was correlated with clinical progression and with the interobserver agreement among three GI pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall mean follow-up was 23 months (range 2-84 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LGD areas in seven of eight patients (88%) who progressed to HGD/CA stained positively for p53 compared to only two of eight nonprogressors (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A correlation with clinical progression was seen for p53 positivity (p = 0.017; log-rank test), and for either p53 positivity or complete agreement among three GI pathologists on LGD diagnosis (p = 0.014; log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The p53 staining demonstrated 88% sensitivity and 75% specificity for progression of LGD to HGD/CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adding complete interobserver agreement on LGD among three experienced GI pathologists to p53 positivity resulted in improved sensitivity with no change in specificity (100% and 75%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with histological evaluation by GI pathologists for a diagnosis of LGD, immunohistochemical staining for p53 can be used as an adjunctive test, as it correlated with progression to HGD/CA in this series </plain></SENT>
