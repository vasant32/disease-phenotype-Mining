<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptides</z:chebi> are promising for use as novel molecular probes that identify cell surface targets unique to disease and can be fluorescence-labeled for detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to select and validate an affinity <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> that binds to <z:mp ids='MP_0000467'>esophageal dysplasia</z:mp> for future clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> selection was performed using phage display by removing nonspecific binders using Q-hTERT (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) cells and achieving specific binding against OE33 (esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selective binding was confirmed on bound phage counts, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, competitive inhibition, and fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On stereomicroscopy, specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> binding to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on endoscopically resected specimens was assessed by rigorous registration of fluorescence intensity to histology in 1-mm intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequence SNFYMPL was selected and showed preferential binding to target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduced binding was observed on competition with unlabeled <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in a dose-dependent manner, an affinity of K(d) = 164 nmol/L was measured, and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> binding to the surface of OE33 cells was validated on fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On esophageal specimens (n = 12), the fluorescence intensity (mean ± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) in 1-mm intervals classified histologically as squamous (n = 145), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (n = 83), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 61), and gastric mucosa (n = 69) was 46.5 ± 1.6, 62.3 ± 5.8, 100.0 ± 9.0, and 42.4 ± 3.0 arb units, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequence SNFYMPL binds specifically to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and can be fluorescence labeled to target premalignant mucosa on imaging </plain></SENT>
