<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is the only known risk factor for these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, emphasis has been placed on the significance of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) on esophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the prevalence of SIM at different esophageal locations in patients who are at higher risk of developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (Caucasians) and patients with lower risk of developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (African-Americans) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven unselected patients (42 Caucasians and 45 African-Americans) underwent routine upper endoscopy with biopsies from the proximal margin of columnar mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We classified patients into those with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> with SIM (CLE with SIM); CLE without SIM; or SIM with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing gastroesophageal junction (SIM-GEJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of CLE with SIM, CLE without SIM, and SIM-GEJ was 28%, 10%, and 10% in Caucasians compared to 0%, 18% and 11% in African-Americans (P = 0.0001, 0.26, and 0.81, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found CLE with SIM only in patients with reflux symptoms at least twice a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that CLE with SIM is seen most commonly in patients thought to be at risk for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (Caucasians with reflux symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is rarely seen in other groups with lower risk for this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (African-Americans, nonrefluxers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely, SIM-GEJ and CLE without SIM are common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups and are of questionable significance </plain></SENT>
