<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend consideration of screening patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unsedated esophagoscopy (UE) is a less costly alternative to standard EGD for identifying BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the indications for EGD referral, the barriers to screening, and the interest in performing UE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A one-page survey was mailed to a random sample of 500 family practitioners and 500 internists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This sample was obtained from the American Academy of Family Physicians and American Society of Internal Medicine (500 from each organization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 54% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority (78%) refer more than 50% of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients for EGD; however, 34% also refer more than 10% of their patients for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary care physicians cited alarm symptoms, refractory symptoms, and chronicity and severity of symptoms as the major indications for referral for EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gender, age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and tobacco use were cited less frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cost of endoscopy, poor patient acceptance, and lack of evidence were the most common reasons cited for not referring for EGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A majority of respondents (62%) indicated that the availability of UE would increase referral for the procedure, and 52% would be willing to perform UE in their office </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Severe, refractory, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> symptoms are the primary reasons for endoscopic referral from primary care physicians who manage patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other risk factors for BE, such as gender and age, do not appear to be important determinants for endoscopic referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of UE as a mechanism to increase screening for BE in primary care patients is merited </plain></SENT>
