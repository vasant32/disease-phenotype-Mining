<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the association between alcohol use, alcohol type, sociodemographic profiles, other lifestyle factors, and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: With the use of a case-control study within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California membership, patients with a new diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 320) diagnosed between 2002 and 2005 were matched to persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>; n = 316) and to population controls (n = 317) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We collected information using validated questionnaires during direct in-person interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses used multivariate unconditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total alcohol use was not significantly associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, although stratification by beverage type showed an inverse association for wine drinkers compared with nondrinkers (&gt;/=7 drinks of wine per week vs none: odds ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.99; multivariate analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among population controls, those who preferred wine were more likely to have college degrees and regularly take vitamin supplements than those who preferred beer or liquor, although adjustment for these factors or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms did not eliminate the inverse association between wine consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Education status was significantly inversely associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are associations between alcohol types, socioeconomic status, and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although choice of alcoholic beverages was associated with several factors, multiple adjustments (including for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) did not eliminate the association between alcohol and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research to evaluate the associations among socioeconomic status, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is warranted </plain></SENT>
