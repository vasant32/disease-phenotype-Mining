<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Esophageal shortening is a known complication of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> that may preclude a tension-free antireflux procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was performed to test the accuracy of preoperative testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From September 1993 to December 1998, 39 patients underwent esophageal mobilization with intraoperative length assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were selected on the basis of irreducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, stricture formation, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the upright position with a fixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> larger than 5 cm on an esophagram were considered to have a short esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Manometric length two standard deviations below the mean for height was considered abnormally short </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 31 patients, intraoperative mobilization was sufficient to allow the gastroesophageal junction to lie 2 cm below the diaphragmatic crus, so no esophageal-lengthening procedure was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with a short esophagus required an esophageal-lengthening procedure after complete mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients subsequently underwent intrathoracic migration of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), with recurrence of symptoms and required gastroplasty during the second surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An esophagram had a sensitivity of 66% and a positive predictive value of 37%, whereas manometric length had a sensitivity of 43% and a positive predictive value of 25% for the diagnosis of short esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The preoperative endoscopic finding of either a stricture or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was the most sensitive test for predicting the need for a lengthening procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Manometry and esophagraphy are not reliable predictors of the short esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional tests and/or tests combined with other parameters are needed </plain></SENT>
