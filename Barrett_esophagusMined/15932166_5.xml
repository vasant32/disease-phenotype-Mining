<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Few studies have evaluated p53 accumulation in the squamous mucosa contiguous (SMC) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and in the new squamous epithelium after endoscopic ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the p53 expression in BE, in the SMC, and in the new squamous mucosa generated after ablation by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Endoscopic biopsy specimens from 37 BE patients, before and after ablation by APC, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The p53 immunostaining criterion used was the staining of at least half of the nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p53 was detected in BE in 5 (13.5%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases, SMC was p53(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, SMC was p53(-) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of p53(-) BE (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 5 cases with p53(+) BE and SMC, the new squamous mucosa continued to be p53(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in the 32 cases with p53(-) SMC, the new squamous mucosa was also p53(-) (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No case with p53(+) SMC turned out to be p53(-) after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no case with p53(-) BE and SMC before eradication became p53(+) after ablation (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: p53 was highly prevalent in the contiguous squamous mucosa when it is present in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After ablation, none of the cases lost p53 expression, and none of the negative cases turned out to be positive </plain></SENT>
