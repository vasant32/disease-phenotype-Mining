<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete eradication was achieved in 77% of 48 patients, with a 10% rate of major complications including <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, and esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although these observations indicate that high-power APC can eradicate Barrett's epithelium in some patients, it is not clear that this expensive and hazardous therapy conveys any clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Even if one makes the substantial leap of faith that APC can decrease the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, that risk is so small for patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> that the number needed to treat is unacceptably large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Available data do not support the routine application of endoscopic ablative therapy for patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
