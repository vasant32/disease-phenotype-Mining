<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME(2)), a promising anticancer agent, modulates Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BEAC) cell growth and behavior through a cellular pathway involving beta-catenin in partnership with E-cadherin, which seems to play a critical role in the induction of antitumor responses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that 2-ME(2) markedly reduced the BEAC cell proliferation through regulating apoptotic machinery such as Bcl-2 and Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It may nullify the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> of the cells by reducing the migratory behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expressions of beta-catenin and E-cadherin and binding of these two proteins is activated in a 2-ME(2)-dependent fashion in Bic-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, overexpressions of these two proteins may be due to the stabilization of these proteins by 2-ME(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that 2-ME(2)-induced antimigratory effects are mediated through the beta-catenin-E-cadherin signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In view of these results, we determined whether 2-ME(2) reduces BEAC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of 2-ME2 significantly decreased the growth of BEAC cells xenografted on the flank of <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The evidence presented points out that the effect of 2-ME(2) on beta-catenin-orchestrated signal transduction plausibly plays a multifaceted functional role to inhibit the proliferation and cell migration of 2-ME(2)-treated malignant cells and it could be a potential candidate in novel treatment strategies for Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
