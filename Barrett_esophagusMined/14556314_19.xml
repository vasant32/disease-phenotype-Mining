<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the reproducibility of the effects should be improved to optimize treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accurate irradiation with light of a proper wavelength (633 nm), fluence and fluence rate has shown to be critical for successful ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we have used in situ light dosimetry to adjust the fluence rate measured within the esophagus for individual animals and monitored <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi>) fluorescence photobleaching simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were administered 200 mg kg-1 ALA (n = 14) or served as control (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were irradiated with an in situ measured fluence rate of 75 mW cm-2 and a fluence of 54 J cm-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, this more accurate method of light dosimetry did not decrease the variation in tissue response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large differences were also observed in the dynamics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> fluorescence photobleaching in animals that received the same measured illumination parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> fluorescence photobleaching rates corresponded with more epithelial damage, whereas lower rates corresponded with no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A two-phased decay in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> fluorescence could be identified in the response group, with a rapid initial phase followed by a slower rate of photobleaching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Non-responders did not show the rapid initial decay and had a significantly lower rate of photobleaching during the second phase of the decay (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
