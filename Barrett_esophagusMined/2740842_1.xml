<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 8 patients with long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> complicated by peptic stricture (n = 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 5), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcer</z:mp> (n = 2), and/or failure or prior antireflux surgery (n = 4), and 4 patients with rapidly advancing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> following surgical resection of the cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After an 8-week course of full-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37961">H2-receptor antagonists</z:chebi>, domperidone and antacids, marginal clinical improvement and unchanged or worsened endoscopic appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, in an attempt to enhance esophageal mucosal resistance, sucralfate alone (4.0 g/d) was given for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both symptoms and endoscopic appearance improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after sucralfate, and the need for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of strictures was lessened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On follow-up, complete healing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was demonstrated by endoscopy in 6 patients after 4 to 6 months of uninterrupted sucralfate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this pilot study indicate that (cyto)protection with sucralfate has an important therapeutic potential in reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also suggest that impaired esophageal epithelial resistance is an important pathophysiological factor in persistence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> refractory to conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
