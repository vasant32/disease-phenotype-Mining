<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic injury and mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> are a known sequlae to pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of acid and duodenogastroesophageal reflux (DGER) to endoscopic severity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-one patients complaining of reflux symptoms were studied with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and graded to non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), erosive reflux disease (ERD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal manometry and simultaneous ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring (Bilitec 2000) were done to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy one patients (78.0%) had ERD (Savary-Miller (grade I-III), 11 patients (12.1%) had NERD and 9 patients (9.9%) had BE suspected endoscopically and diagnosed by histological esophageal biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined 24-h esophageal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and pH monitoring revealed that 39 patients (42.9%) had mixed acid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e>, 16 (17.6%) had pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> only, 18 (19.8%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> only and 18 patients (19.8%) had no evidence of abnormal reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of the total time of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> absorbance above 0.14, in 71 patients with ERD was (8.18 +/- 11.28%), and in 9 patients with BE was (15.48 +/- 30.48%) which was significantly greater than that in 11 patients with NERD (4.48 +/- 8.99%), p &lt; 0.05 and p = 0.01 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BE patients had abnormal esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> (3 bile alone and 6 mixed bile and acid); 44 of 71 patients (61.97%) with ERD had abnormal esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> (13 bile alone and 31 mixed bile and acid); meanwhile 15 of them (21.2%) had abnormal acid exposure alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 patients with NERD, 4 patients (36.4%) had abnormal esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e>, 2 of them mixed with acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Bilitec method reliably identifies the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and quantitatively detects duodenogastroesophageal reflux of bile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mixed reflux (acid and bile) is the chief pattern of reflux in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients in this study </plain></SENT>
