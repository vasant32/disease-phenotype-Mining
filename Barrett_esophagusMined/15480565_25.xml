<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare ante- versus post mortem findings in a multidisciplinary ICU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Thirty-one-bed, medico-surgical ICU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who died on the ICU and underwent an autopsy examination in 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Records from autopsies were compared with clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A modified Goldman's criteria was used to categorize the post mortem diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpected findings were evaluated according to the duration of hospitalization prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (fewer than or more than 10 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 2,984 ICU admissions, there were 489 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; 222 autopsies were conducted (45.4% autopsy rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post mortem examination revealed unexpected findings in 50 patients (22.5%), including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (22 [9.9%]), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> (9 [4%]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (7 [3.2%]), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nosocomial infections</z:e> (3 [1.3%]), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677607" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hashimoto's disease</z:e> (3 [1.3%]), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267406" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mesenteric infarction</z:e> (2 [0.9%]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (2 [0.9%]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (1 [0.5%]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (1 [0.5%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These unexpected findings were considered as major (Class I/II) in 19 (8.5%), and minor (Class III) in 31 (14%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with a short ICU length of stay (&lt;10 days), there were more major unexpected findings than minor, while after a prolonged stay (&gt;10 days), minor unexpected findings were more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After a short ICU stay (&lt;10 days), autopsy revealed discrepancies primarily related to the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> associated with diseases whose diagnosis can be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Following more prolonged ICU stays (&gt;10 days), autopsy was more likely to reveal coexisting diseases unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
