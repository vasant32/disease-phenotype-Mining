<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many modalities have been used to ablate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, long term results and comparative effectiveness are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Our aim was to compare the long term efficacy of achieving complete reversal (endoscopic and histological) between multipolar electrocoagulation (MPEC) and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) in BO patients and assess factors influencing successful ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with BO, 2-6 cm long, underwent 24 hour pH testing on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were then randomised by BO length to undergo ablation with MPEC or APC every 4-8 weeks until endoscopic reversal or maximal of six treatment sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty five BO patients have been followed for at least two years following endoscopic ablation, 16 treated with MPEC and 19 with APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was complete reversal of BO in 24 patients (69%); 75% with MPEC and 63% with APC (p = 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the number of sessions required in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in age, pH results, BO length, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> dose, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> size between patients with and without complete reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient developed an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014866" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophageal stricture</z:e> but there were no major complications such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In BO patients treated with MPEC or APC in combination with acid suppression, at long term follow up, complete reversal of BO can be maintained in approximately 70% of patients, irrespective of the technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There are no predictors associated with achieving complete reversal of BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Continued surveillance is still indicated in the post ablative setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As yet, these techniques are not ready for clinical application (other than for high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) and cannot be offered outside the research arena </plain></SENT>
