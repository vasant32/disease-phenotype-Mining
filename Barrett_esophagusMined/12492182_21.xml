<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive Barrett's patients in whom HGD or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was detected were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radial array echoendosonography and high frequency catheter probe ultrasonography were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded if ultrasound revealed the presence of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> with regional lymph nodes or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> trunk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> or extension of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> into superficial submucosa (T1sm1) or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nd:YAG laser used <z:chebi fb="115" ids="46727">quartz</z:chebi> contact probes, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Barrett's epithelium targeted at each session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete ablation was confirmed with Lugol's <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy followed by surveillance biopsies of the neosquamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were ascertained by scheduled telephone contact interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 36 patients with HGD/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were evaluated at our center, 17 of whom met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 14 have remained in the study, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> have had successful elimination of HGD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, 11 patients (78.6%) achieved complete endoscopic and histological ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Barrett's tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (14.3%) achieved 95% destruction of Barrett's with residual metaplastic columnar epithelium containing goblet cells without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient has obtained 75% ablation of Barrett's, with residual metaplastic columnar epithelium harboring Barrett's with low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Major complications included two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> (11.8%) and one mild upper GI bleed (5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary experience with Nd:YAG contact laser for the treatment of Barrett's HGD and early superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> seems promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The need for additional controlled trials with larger numbers of patients with longer follow-up, as well as consideration of a head-to-head trial with Photofrin photodynamic therapy, is warranted </plain></SENT>
