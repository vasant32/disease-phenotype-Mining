<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the proliferative activity of intestinalized epithelium of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (IMEGEJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections from 78 consecutive patients (20 with IMEGEJ, 58 without IMEGEJ) who had elective upper gastrointestinal endoscopy over a 6-month period were immunohistochemically stained with MIB-1, the Ki-67 proliferation-antigen-associated marker, for evaluation of the crypt MIB-1 proliferation index (PI), size of the proliferative zone (PZ), and the presence of surface epithelial staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from the IMEGEJ and non-IMEGEJ groups, and from 15 age-matched patients with traditional long-segment BE (&gt;3.0 cm), were compared statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IMEGEJ patients showed a statistically significant increase in the mean crypt PI compared with non-IMEGEJ controls (21.9+/-19.5 v 14.3+/-9.3; P=.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, IMEGEJ cases showed an increase in the mean crypt PZ (52.3+/-16.4 v 45.2+/-17.2; P=.05), and a trend toward an increase in the percentage of cases with MIB-1-positive surface epithelial cells (50% v 33%, P=.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with IMEGEJ did not differ from patients without IMEGEJ with respect to any other clinical or histological feature, including signs or symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MIB-1 results of the patients with long-segment BE (MIB-1 PI = 22.6+/-20.5, MIB-1 PZ = 51.8+/-19.6, proportion of cases with MIB-1-positive surface cells = 66%) were similar to those with IMEGEJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intestinalized epithelium in the distal esophagus or gastroesophageal junction shows increased proliferative activity in comparison with patients without intestinalized epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding supports an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in patients with IMEGEJ </plain></SENT>
