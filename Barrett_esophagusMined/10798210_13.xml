<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was assessed as fractions of cells in the S and G2 phases, measured in biopsies of Barrett's tissue and analyzed by DNA content flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevated proportions in the S and G2 phases predict progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cells in the S phase was positively associated with waist-to-hip ratio (r = 0.33, p &lt; 0.05) and negatively associated with serum and dietary <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> (r = -0.34 and -0.32, respectively, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cells in the G2 phase was positively associated with weight change from age 25 (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.01) and negatively associated with dietary <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> (r = -0.31, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that increasing <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in adulthood, increasing waist-to-hip ratio, and decreasing dietary <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> intake and serum levels increase the risk of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
