<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Relatives of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have an increased prevalence of reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to find if these relatives were at increased risk of having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: First degree relatives of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> completed the Reflux Symptom Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relatives with reflux symptoms, never previously investigated. were invited for endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls were patients with similar reflux symptoms and no family histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found previously undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (&gt;3 cm) in eight of 100 relatives (8%) from 53 families and in five of 100 controls (5%) (adjusted OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 0.46-5.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Including another 27 previously investigated cases, 10 of the 53 families had two or more cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> prevalence increased with age (p = 0.014) and was associated with reflux symptoms of &gt;10 yr (p = 0.020), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was twice as common in males (p = 0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was found in 74% of relatives and 57% of controls without Barrett's (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in any one symptomatic relative of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was not statistically higher than in other persons with reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, more relatives of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients have reflux symptoms, so the overall prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in relatives may also be greater than in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In considering whether to screen patients with reflux symptoms for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, age and duration of symptoms are stronger predictors than having a relative with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
