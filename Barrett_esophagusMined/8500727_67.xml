<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Antireflux therapy has generally failed to induce regression of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that squamous epithelium could be restored if the columnar tissue was ablated while gastric acid secretion was suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten white men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> received 40 mg of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, every 2-5 weeks they underwent videotaped endoscopies to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser photoablate columnar tissue, obtain biopsy specimens, and assess results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Squamous re-epithelialization was assessed by correlation of videotapes and directed biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients had one to eight areas ablated, totaling 0.5-12.0 cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Videotape assessments were corroborated by biopsy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one instance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight of 40 treatment locations partially or completely re-epithelialized with squamous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Squamous regrowth appeared to occur by spread from contiguous squamous borders and de novo from glandular tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regrowth was influenced by the extent of squamous borders and completeness of ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nonablated glandular tissue persisted beneath squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ablation of Barrett's epithelium and suppression of acid secretion facilitated squamous re-epithelialization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A progenitor cell within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_605'>metaplastic tissue</z:mpath> has the potential to differentiate normally </plain></SENT>
