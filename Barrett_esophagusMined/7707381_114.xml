<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the United States, the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus, including the esophagogastric junction, has been increasing rapidly over the past two decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Except for an association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, little is known about the etiology of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Our purpose was to investigate dietary and nutritional risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based, case-control interview study of 174 white men with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and 750 control subjects living in three areas of the United States was conducted during 1986 through 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Risk was significantly elevated for subjects in the heaviest quartile compared with the lightest quartile of body mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8-5.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were seen with total calories from food, number of meals eaten per day, level of fat intake, or consumption of coffee and tea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risks were highest for those consuming the least amount of vegetables, with some evidence of a dose response for the subcategories of cruciferous vegetables (P for trend &lt; .001) and vegetables consumed raw (P for trend = .10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significantly elevated risk was also seen for those consuming the least amount of raw fruit (P for trend = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No clear associations were reported for intake of particular micronutrients overall or in supplements, but a significant protective effect was associated with increasing intake of dietary fiber (P for trend = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings of an increased risk with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and decreased risks with intake of raw fruits and vegetables and dietary fiber provide useful directions to pursue in further investigations of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS: The finding with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is particularly noteworthy, since it may explain at least a portion of the recent epidemic increases reported in the incidence of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
