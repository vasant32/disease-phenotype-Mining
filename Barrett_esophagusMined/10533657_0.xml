<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 4 of them displayed a Barrett's epithelium (BE) with a specialized columnar epithelium and globet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As it is already published, a male predominance was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In three of these patients some predisposing factor to develop BE was detected (i.e. severe central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> and chemotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) with abnormal pH probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was suggested by characteristic endoscopy images in 2 patients and was confirmed by biopsy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been primary treated with proton-bomb inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients were treated by a Nissen fundoplication, 4 and 6 month after diagnosis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with severe neurological damage will undergo the same surgery soon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In another patient with caustic esophageal injury, the affected esophagus will be resected, restoring continuity with stomach or colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In view of the potential oncogenous transformation of BE, the importance of not overlooking this anomaly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with severe GER is highlighted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases with predisposing factors to develop BE should be closely followed by periodic examination and multiple biopsies </plain></SENT>
