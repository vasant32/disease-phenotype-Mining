<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to examine the impact of treating patients with BE and with HGD by using porfimer <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (POR) and photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) for ablating HGD and reducing the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The design was a multicenter, partially blinded (pathology), randomized clinical trial conducted in patients with BE who have HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 30 contributing centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 485 patients were screened, with 208 in the intent-to-treat population and 202 in the safety population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized on a 2:1 basis to compare <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> with POR plus <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (PORPDT) with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> only (OM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measurement was complete HGD ablation occurring at any time during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant difference (p &lt; 0.0001) in favor of PORPDT (106/138 [77%]) compared with OM (27/70 [39%]) in complete ablation of HGD at any time during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the PORPDT group (13%) (n=18) was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.006) compared with the OM group (28%) [corrected] (n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The safety profile showed 94% of patients in the PORPDT group and 13% of patients in the OM group had treatment-related adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The limitations of the study were that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> therapy may have had to be applied more than once and that patients spent more time in treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients and the physicians were not blinded to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PORPDT in conjunction with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> is an effective therapy for ablating HGD in patients with BE and in reducing the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
