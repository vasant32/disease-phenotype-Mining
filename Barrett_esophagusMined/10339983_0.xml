<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparison was also made with postoperative radiographs of resected esophageal specimens from 3 of the patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 14 of the 17, the classification based on the gastrointestinal radiographs was consistent with the gross classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 10 of the 18 patients, rough mucosa was seen on gastrointestinal radiographs in the same area in which Barrett's epithelium was observed in the histopathological specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sliding esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> was present in 12 of the 18 patients, a relatively high incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regular granular or reticular shadows were observed on the mucosal surface of the esophagus on the postoperative radiographs of 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is believed that a diagnosis of Barrett's epithelium can be made from gastrointestinal radiographs if these mucosal patterns are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although a definitive diagnosis of Barrett's epithelium based on upper gastrointestinal radiographs is considered difficult, the presence of rough mucosa in the esophagus around the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in combination with esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> are suggestive of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising from Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
