<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Operability was 90% (232/257); overall resectability, 77% (198/257), and for the operated group, 85% (198/232) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality rate was 9.6% but decreased to 3% over the period 1986 to 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 65% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous cell epitheliomas</z:e> and 35% <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e>, nodes, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (pTNM) staging was as follows: stage I, 11.6%; stage II, 23.2%; stage III, 37.9%; stage IV, 27.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rate was 62.5% at 1 year, 42.4% at 2 years, and 30% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the pTNM staging, 5-year survival was 90% for stage I, 56% for stage II, 15.3% for stage III, and 0 for stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization, pathologic type, sex, or age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Introducing extensive resection and extended lymphadenectomy seems to improve significantly survival in patients in whom an operation with curative intention was performed, the 1 year survival rate being 90.8% versus 72%; 2-year survival, 81% versus 46%; and 5-year survival, 48.5% versus 41% for radical and nonradical resections, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on multivariate Cox regression analysis, only TNM stage and presence or absence of lymph nodes are important factors in predicting survival: stage 1 tumors have lower risk, and involvement of lymph nodes creates higher risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using this analysis, there was only for the patients with involved lymph nodes (N1) a significantly better prognosis when a radical lymph node dissection was performed (p = 0.0055) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> have no worse prognosis than other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo>, with a 5-year survival rate of 91.5% if lymph nodes are negative, and a 54% overall 5-year survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Functional results after restoration of continuity with gastric tubulation were judged excellent to very good in 86.5% at 1 year, but infra-aortic anastomoses have a much higher incidence of peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>: 53% versus 8% for cervical anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>From this study it can be concluded that in experienced hands surgery today offers the best chances for optimal staging, potential cure, and prolonged high-quality palliation </plain></SENT>
