<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We looked for evidence of acid-induced DNA damage, including DSBs, in benign Barrett's epithelial (BAR-T) cell lines in vitro and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In BAR-T cells, we also explored the mechanisms underlying acid-induced DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We exposed BAR-T cells to acid in the presence of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39442">fluorescent probe</z:chebi> for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in the presence or absence of disodium 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (which prevents intracellular acidification) and N-acety-l-cysteine (a scavenger of ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DSBs were detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H2AX phosphorylation and by CometAssay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During endoscopy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, we took biopsy specimens from the metaplastic mucosa before and after esophageal perfusion with 0.1 N HCl for 3 min and sought DSBs by Western blotting for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H2AX phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In BAR-T cells, acid exposure resulted in ROS production and caused a time-dependent increase in levels of phospho-H2AX that continued for at least 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with disodium 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate or N-acety-l-cysteine prevented the acid-induced increase in phospho-H2AX levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DSBs also were detected in biopsy specimens of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> following esophageal acid perfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Acid exposure causes DSBs in Barrett's epithelial cells through ROS produced as a consequence of intracellular acidification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that acid can be considered a carcinogen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
