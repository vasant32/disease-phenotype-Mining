<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>White males predominated (73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A history of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> was frequently absent, being elicited in only eight of 14 patients (57%) with a carefully obtained history at the time of presentation with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival was relatively short with a median survival of 23 +/- 5 months, and only three patients had a disease-free survival longer than 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A pathologic spectrum of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was found: differentiation ranged from well to poorly differentiated in the 20 patients with a single <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; two separate <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were found in four patients; and a spectrum of differentiation in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1298180" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">single tumor</z:e> was found in the other two cases, one an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334302" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adenocarcinoid tumor</z:e> and the other an adenosquamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were generally far advanced, with extension through the esophageal wall in 23 of 26 cases (88%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastases to lymph nodes</z:e> in 17 of 24 cases (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>Epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath>, including <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ in some cases, was found in Barrett's mucosa adjacent to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that a surveillance program for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients known to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is warranted in an attempt to improve the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of surveillance on the incidence of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> may be lessened by its frequent occurrence in patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
