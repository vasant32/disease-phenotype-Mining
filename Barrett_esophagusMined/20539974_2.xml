<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the influence of endoscopic therapy on quality of life (QOL) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233705" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">fear of cancer</z:e> recurrence is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored QOL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233705" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">fear of cancer</z:e> recurrence 12 - 60 months after endoscopic and surgical treatment for early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, using a cross-sectional design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 81 patients with early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> underwent endoscopic treatment and 33 patients underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The choice of treatment was based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, depth of penetration or patient preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QOL was measured using the SF-36, EORTC-QLQ-C30, and the EORTC-QLQ-OES18 questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and fear of recurrence were measured using the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (HADS) and the Worry Of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Scale (WOCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 66 endoscopy patients and 29 surgery patients were eligible for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires were completed by 64/66 (97 %) endoscopy patients and 27 / 29 (93 %) surgery patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses were conducted, with sex, age, comorbidity, and histology of the resected specimen used as covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients in the surgery group reported significantly more eating problems (OR = 18.3; P &lt; 0.001) and reflux symptoms (OR = 3.4; P = 0.05) on the EORTC-OES18 questionnaire, whereas endoscopy patients reported more fear of recurrence on the WOCS than surgery patients ( P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between the two groups on the other outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preservation of the esophagus after endoscopy treatment, which is preferred from a clinical perspective, may induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233705" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">fear of cancer</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Proper patient education with specific attention to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233705" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">fear of cancer</z:e> recurrence may therefore be required </plain></SENT>
