<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Endoscopic eradication therapy for dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has become an encouraging alternative to esophagectomy or continued endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of SSIM before and after ablation is concerning because this tissue may have potential for malignant progression, is not visible by conventional endoscopy, and may evade detection by random esophageal biopsy sampling methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Advances in endoscopic high-resolution three-dimensional optical coherence tomography recently have revealed SSIM in a majority of patients both before and after complete eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> by radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies suggest that although cells of Barrett's glands are highly proliferative, the cells of these buried glands are more dormant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the malignant potential of SSIM cells remains undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Novel endoscopic imaging demonstrates that SSIM is present in the majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, both before and after ablative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although these subsquamous cells exhibit less proliferative activity than those of typical surface Barrett's glands, the malignant potential of the buried glands, especially when challenged by injurious factors, remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future methods to detect subsurface <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> will be needed </plain></SENT>
