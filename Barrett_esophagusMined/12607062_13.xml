<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether cardia <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> should be categorized as a distinct entity independent of subcardial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 65 patients undergoing resection for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> involving the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> center within 5 cm of the EGJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the EGJ were classified into Type I, Type II, and Type III according to Siewert's criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was only one Type I <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and it was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had their center between 1 cm and 2 cm proximal to the EGJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic features and prognosis were compared among patients with Type II <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> ( n = 31), patients with Type III <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> ( n = 33), and patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in the upper third of the stomach not invading the EGJ ( n = 153) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Siewert's Type II <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was associated with a higher male/female ratio and with higher incidences of well-demarcated appearance and differentiated histology than <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the upper third of the stomach without esophageal invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lymph nodes along the greater curvature and parapyloric nodes were rarely involved in Type II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the pT2 category, patients with Siewert's Type II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed a higher incidence of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and a significantly lower survival rate than did patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the upper third of the stomach without esophageal invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, cardia <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, appropriately defined as <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with its epicenter between 1 cm proximal and 2 cm distal to the EGJ, should be categorized as a distinct entity </plain></SENT>
