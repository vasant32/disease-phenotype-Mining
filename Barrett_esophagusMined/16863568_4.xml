<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) requires histologic confirmation of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) through biopsy, a technique prone to sampling error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One method designed to improve the yield of biopsy uses <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> with magnification endoscopy: enhanced magnification endoscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This technique identifies several mucosal surface patterns, and of these, pattern types III and IV have been associated with SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized trial to compare <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e>-directed biopsies and standard endoscopy with random biopsies in patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the standard endoscopy group with evidence of BE had four-quadrant random biopsies taken every 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If there was no BE, four-quadrant biopsies were taken at the SCJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e> group had the mucosa at the SCJ classified as type I-IV based on published criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopsies targeted to type III and IV were compared to random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven patients enrolled (68 randomized to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e>, 69 to standard endoscopy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six (41%) had endoscopic evidence of BE (20 standard endoscopy [29%] vs 36 EME [53%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with apparent BE, standard endoscopy with random biopsies confirmed SIM in 12 (60%) compared to 11 of 18 (61%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e> targeted biopsies of patterns type III or IV (p = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients without apparent BE (N = 81) had SIM of the SCJ confirmed in 16% (8 of 49) with standard endoscopy and random biopsies compared with 8% (1 of 12) using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e>-directed biopsy of pattern III or IV (p = 0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Random biopsies of endoscopically apparent BE and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SCJ yield SIM at the same rate as targeted biopsies with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e> in patients with pattern types III or IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This calls into question the utility of this technique in reducing sampling error to identify SIM </plain></SENT>
