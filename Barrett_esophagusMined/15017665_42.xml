<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For these patients, the multimodal approach of endoscopic mucosal resection and photodynamic therapy (EMR/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) may be a viable, less invasive option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review (1996-2001) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing either combined EMR/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> group or esophagectomy (SURG) for early-stage Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on patient demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging, procedure-related morbidity and mortality, persistence or recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in outcomes between the 2 groups were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were identified in the EMR/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> group and 64 in the SURG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SURG group was found to have a significantly higher procedure-related complication rate compared with the EMR/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> group (31 vs. 4; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the EMR/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> group, whereas one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in the SURG group as a result of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three percent of patients (20 of 24) in the EMR/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the SURG group remained free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> over a follow-up of 12 +/- 2 and 19 +/- 3 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients in the EMR/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> group failed to respond to therapy; 2 of them underwent alternate therapies and are free of disease, whereas the other 2 died of unrelated causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of EMR/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> seems to be a viable and less morbid alternative to standard esophagectomy in patients presenting with early Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A prospective randomized, controlled trial of EMR/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> compared with esophagectomy for managing early <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may be warranted </plain></SENT>
