<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) in the columnar lined distal oesophagus defines <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> with the risk of future <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of both IM and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (low grade (LGD) and high grade (HGD)) within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e> is patchy and mosaic requiring random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Techniques that could help target areas of high yield within Barrett's mucosa would be helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the utility of high magnification chromoendoscopy (MCE) in the detection of IM, LGD, and HGD in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients detected with columnar mucosa in the distal oesophagus were studied using an Olympus magnification endoscope (GIF-Q16OZ, 115x) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distal oesophagus was sprayed with indigo carmine solution and the oesophageal columnar mucosa patterns were noted under high magnification and targeted for biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsies were read by pathologists blinded to the endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (that is, columnar lined distal oesophagus) were studied: mean age 62.7 years (range 35-81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean length of columnar mucosa was 3.7 cm (range 0.5-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three types of mucosal patterns were noted within the columnar mucosa after spraying indigo carmine and using MCE: ridged/villous pattern, circular pattern, and irregular/distorted pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The yield of IM on target biopsies according to the patterns was: ridged/villous 57/62 (97%) and circular 2/12 (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients had an irregular/distorted pattern and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had HGD on biopsy (6/6 (100%)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had LGD on target biopsies; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had the ridged/villous pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with long segment Barrett's were identified using MCE whereas 23/28 patients (82%) with short segment Barrett's had the ridged/villous pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MCE helps visually identify areas with IM and HGD having specific patterns but not patients with LGD (appear similar to IM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>MCE may be a useful clinical tool for the increased detection of patients with IM as well as for surveillance of patients for the detection of HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>If these preliminary results are validated, MCE would help identify high yield areas, potentially eliminating the need for random biopsies </plain></SENT>
