<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The comparative effectiveness (CE) of endoscopic screening (versus no screening) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, or among different endoscopic surveillance strategies in patients with BE, for the early detection of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is unclear if patients or providers have or will adopt any of these strategies (screening only, screening and surveillance, vs. none), irrespective of their effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic screening and surveillance is expensive and can be risky </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is imperative to establish the CE and acceptability about the risks and outcomes related to these practices to better inform expert recommendations and provider-patient decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS/RESULTS: We propose a mixed methods study which will involve: (1) an analysis of secondary databases (VA and VA-Medicare linked datasets for 2004-09) to examine CE of endoscopic screening and surveillance in an observational study cohort (an estimated 680,000 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>; 25,000-30,000 with BE; and 3,000 with EA); (2) a structured electronic medical record (EMR) review on a national sample of patients using VA EMRs to verify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EA cases, identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-targeted therapy, and validate the screening and surveillance endoscopy; and (3) qualitative in depth interviews with patients and providers to elicit preferences, norms, and behaviors to explain clinical contexts of these findings and address gaps arising from the CE study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study will compare clinical strategies for detecting and monitoring BE, a pre-cancerous lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, by eliciting acceptability of these strategies for patients and providers, we will be able to propose effective and feasible strategies that are likely to be implemented in routine use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings will inform recommendations for clinical practice guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our innovative approach is consistent with the methodological standards of patient-centered outcomes research, and our findings will offer a significant contribution to the literature on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveillance </plain></SENT>
