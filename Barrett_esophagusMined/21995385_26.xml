<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a nationwide, population-based, cohort study involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in Denmark during the period from 1992 through 2009, using data from the Danish Pathology Registry and the Danish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the incidence rates (numbers of cases per 1000 person-years) of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a measure of relative risk, standardized incidence ratios were calculated with the use of national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> rates in Denmark during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 11,028 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and analyzed their data for a median of 5.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the first year after the index endoscopy, 131 new cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During subsequent years, 66 new <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were detected, yielding an incidence rate for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of 1.2 cases per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As compared with the risk in the general population, the relative risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was 11.3 (95% CI, 8.8 to 14.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The annual risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Detection of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> on the index endoscopy was associated with an incidence rate for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of 5.1 cases per 1000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the incidence rate among patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 1.0 case per 1000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risk estimates for patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were slightly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a strong risk factor for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, but the absolute annual risk, 0.12%, is much lower than the assumed risk of 0.5%, which is the basis for current surveillance guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Data from the current study call into question the rationale for ongoing surveillance in patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
