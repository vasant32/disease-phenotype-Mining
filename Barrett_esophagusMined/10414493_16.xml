<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to evaluate the prognostic utility of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16069">IMD</z:chebi> in esophageal Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AdCa) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>), and to determine the effect of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (chemrad) on this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> from 67 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> (45 with Barrett's-associated AdCa, 22 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) were stained with the vascular marker CD31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16069">IMD</z:chebi> was calculated by evaluating at least 5 different 200 x fields of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> hot spot areas to obtain the mean microvessel count (MVC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data then were correlated with the clinical and pathological features, chemrad status, and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MVC was significantly higher in AdCa (143 +/- 63.2) compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> (77.2 +/- 38.6, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In AdCa, no correlation was noted between the MVC and any of the clinical or pathological features, including chemrad status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>, a statistically significant higher MVC was detected in patients who did not receive chemrad (97.2 +/- 37.3) compared with those who did (48.3 +/- 15.9, P = .002) and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that were larger in size (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the MVC did not correlate with survival in either AdCa or <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is not a significant prognostic indicator in either esophageal AdCa or <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preoperative chemrad has a positive effect on reducing the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo>, particularly <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
