<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLE has the potential to be a disruptive technology in that it can change the current algorithms that depend on biopsy to perform surveillance of high-risk conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it allows on-table decision making that has the potential to guide therapy in real time and reduce the need for repeated procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLE and related technologies are often termed "virtual biopsy" as they simulate the images seen in traditional histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the imaging of living tissue allows more than just pragmatic convenience; it also allows imaging of living tissue such as active capillary circulation, cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and vascular and endothelial translocation, thus extending beyond what is capable in traditional biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediate potential applications of CLE are to guide biopsy sampling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> surveillance, evaluation of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and intraductal imaging of the pancreas and bile duct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data on these applications is rapidly emerging, and more is needed to clearly demonstrate the optimal applications of CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we will focus on the role of CLE as applied to colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> detected during colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
