<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, including associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, can be achieved by various techniques, but few long-term results are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was ablation of intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with a combination of Nd:YAG laser plus multipolar electrocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> who either had refused surgery or were poor candidates for surgery because of high risk were offered endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent therapy with Nd:YAG laser and multipolar electrocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were treated with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> (20 mg twice daily) as maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients were enrolled in the study over a 7-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were men with a mean age of 78.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was 6.0 cm (range, 3 to 10 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen Nd:YAG laser (mean, 2.8/patient) and 20 multipolar electrocoagulation (mean, 3.3/patient) sessions were used during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a complete initial response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> immunosuppressive medications had recurrence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> after an initial complete response (36-month follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients have no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and 3 patients have residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> on biopsy of an irregular appearing "neo" Z-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up in this group is 3.4 years (range, 9 to 86 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laser photocoagulation and multipolar electrocoagulation can be successfully and safely used to ablate intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients remain functional with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> swallowing </plain></SENT>
