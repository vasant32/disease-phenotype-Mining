<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this ongoing 12-month trial is to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> eradication after radiofrequency ablation using a balloon-based (HALO-360) and a plate-based (HALO-90) device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here our experience with the first 10 patients (out of 40) who have completed 12 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Following radiofrequency ablation using the HALO-360 device <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were maintained on double-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic evaluation was performed at 3 and 12 months postablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at 3 months underwent repeat ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients, seven with nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, two with low-grade and one with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> have completed the study to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> eradication was achieved in seven patients, and partial eradication was achieved in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One case of buried Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was encountered and successfully re-ablated, with complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> eradication achieved at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, Barrett's eradication rates were comparable to previously published reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One case of buried Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was identified out of 247 biopsies and was eradicated with repeat ablation </plain></SENT>
