<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, a novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated protein, termed MN, has been described in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the uterine cervix, where its expression has been shown to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in the esophagus develops through a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence similar to that which occurs in the cervix, this study was performed to evaluate MN expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, preneoplastic, and neoplastic tissues of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Esophageal tumor</z:e> resection specimens from 27 patients (12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo>, one multifocal squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 10 Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, two adenosquamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) were immunohistochemically stained with a monoclonal antibody (clone M75) directed against the MN antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The localization of MN antigen, as well as the proportion of positively stained cells, were determined in sections of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, dysplastic, and carcinomatous tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The staining characteristics were correlated with the pathological features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weak intracellular MN expression was detected only in the basal cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, inflamed and reactive squamous epithelium showed increased staining in the basal layer and in the overlying mature squamous cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MN expression was significantly increased in dysplastic squamous epithelium (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> (100%) stained positively for MN antigen, where the pattern of staining was predominantly membranous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the degree of MN staining did not correlate with any of the pathological features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's epithelium, MN stained positively in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of metaplastic cells and showed no difference in dysplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo>, only 80% of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were positive for MN, but the degree of MN expression was inversely correlated with histological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation (P &lt; .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that (1) the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated MN antigen may play a role in proliferation and regeneration in esophageal squamous epithelium, and (2) loss of MN expression may be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> in Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
