<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was studied using data from 51,311 patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy between 1976 and 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three hundred seventy-seven patients had greater than or equal to 3-cm columnar epithelium in the esophagus and no <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> increased with age to reach a plateau by the seventh decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half of the maximum prevalence was reached by age 40 years, the estimated median age of development of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike prevalence, the mean length of columnar epithelium did not increase with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant change in length was found in 21 patients followed up for a mean of 7.3 years (mean initial length, 8.29 +/- 0.85 cm; mean final length, 8.33 +/- 0.77 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The length of columnar epithelium did not increase in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or decrease when <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age at diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was 63 years without <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and 64 years in a separate group of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data are consistent with a fairly rapid evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to its full length with little subsequent change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may develop more than 20 years before the mean age of clinical recognition or the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
