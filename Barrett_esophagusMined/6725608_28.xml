<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CELO consists of three histological types of epithelium: gastric-fundic, junctional, and specialised columnar, the last resembling <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a previous study of CELO an incompletely differentiated variant of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> secreting sulphomucins (type II B) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was shown to be associated with well differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, as in the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper has been to define by histochemistry the mucin profile of CELO in 17 patients and to compare it with the mucin profile of the gastroesophageal junction in 27 patients without CELO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In CELO a specialised columnar epithelium was always found and type II B <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (with sulphomucins) showed the highest incidence (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, this type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was found in only three of 27 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type II B <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> has often been considered as a precancerous lesion or as an equivalent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; consequently, its high incidence in our study on CELO raises the question of whether this lesion should be considered a high risk condition for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the lower oesophagus </plain></SENT>
