<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Barrett's mucosa is a risk factor for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and should be detected at an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CDX2 and liver-intestine (LI)-cadherin are intestine-specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrant CDX2 expression has been demonstrated in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The relationship between CDX2 and LI-cadherin expression was investigated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastroesophageal (n = 24) and in Barrett's (n = 20) mucosa, in low-grade (n = 15) and high-grade (n = 13) intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (IEN) as well as in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 16), using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nuclear positivity for CDX2 coupled with membranous expression of LI-cadherin was observed in about 70% of the epithelial cells of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intensity of staining and the percentage of positive cells increased within the sequential steps of low-grade to high-grade IEN, whereas the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cylindric epithelium lacked the expression of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, the expression of LI-cadherin and CDX2 was significantly weaker or absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CDX2 and LI-cadherin are sensitive markers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the upper gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both can be helpful for the early histologic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and its subsequent lesions; however, they do not significantly discern between different grades of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
