<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study patients were separated into group A, with proven residual HGD/EC, and group B with possible HGD/EC (positive lateral margins in the endoscopic resection specimen, without HGD/EC in the remaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> treatment consisted of 5-aminolevulinic (5-ALA) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">photosensitization</z:e> (40 mg/kg) followed by illumination of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> with a total light dose of 100 J/cm (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was defined as the absence of HGD/EC in biopsies taken in two consecutive follow-up endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, as well as the recurrence rate of HGD/EC, was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 20 patients underwent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> (group A, 11; group B, 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mild complications were seen in 4/26 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall success rate was 15/20 (75 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in success rate between group A (55 %) and group B (100 %); P = 0.03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>; the median regression percentage was 50 % (IQR 25 - 70 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of HGD/EC occurred in four patients (two each in groups A and B) after a median follow up of 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this selected group of patients, the addition of 5-ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> after endoscopic resection for HGD/EC had a disappointing success rate in patients who had residual HGD/EC after endoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most patients undergoing 5-ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> have residual Barrett mucosa after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and 5-ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> does not seem to prevent recurrences during follow-up </plain></SENT>
