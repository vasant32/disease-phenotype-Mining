<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are part of the regular staging protocol in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The value of the two methods was assessed in patients with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients (median age 64 yr, interquartile range [IQR] 58-72) with suspected early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who were referred to our hospital for endoscopic therapy were prospectively included in a standardized staging program with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, EUS (7.5 MHz in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases plus 12.5 or 20 MHz for elevated and/or depressed lesions), CT of the chest and upper abdomen, and abdominal ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were summarized in accordance with the TNM classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the lymph node findings on CT and/or EUS, the patients were assigned to three categories: C1, no suspicious lymph nodes; C2, paraesophageal lymph nodes &lt; or =1 cm in size at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> level, lymph nodes &gt; or =1 cm in size not at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> level in the mediastinum or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> trunk; and C3, paraesophageal lymph nodes &gt; 1 cm in size at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EUS and CT findings were checked every 6 months in patients who underwent endoscopic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection was scheduled in operable patients if staging showed a T category higher than T1 and/or the lymph node staging was assessed as C3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with suspected submucosal infiltration underwent diagnostic endoscopic resection, and if submucosal involvement was confirmed were referred for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 25 months (IQR 19.5-30.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The T category diagnosed with CT was &lt; or = T1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On EUS, the T category was classified as T1 in 92% of cases (N = 92) and as &gt; T1 in 8% (N = 8, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>Enlarged lymph nodes</z:mp> (C2 and C3) were detected in 45% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significantly more C2 lymph nodes were diagnosed with EUS than CT (28 vs 19, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lymph nodes at the level with the highest suspicion, C3, were detected using CT in only three of nine cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of CT for N staging was not acceptable compared with EUS (38%vs 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No extranodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were found on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In suspected early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, EUS is superior to CT for T staging and N staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>As CT had no influence on the TNM classification in any of these patients, it may be possible to dispense with this method as a staging procedure in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>By contrast, EUS is required in order to differentiate between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in whom endoscopic therapy is suitable and those in whom surgical treatment is required </plain></SENT>
