<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An accurate determination of the extent of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is critical to the study of its natural history and response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis is that area calculations offer advantages over length estimates of Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Changes in both measures and estimates of progression or regression between two endoscopies in 17 patients were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Area was calculated using a computer image analysis technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although there was no significant difference in length correlation versus area correlation between endoscopies (r = 0.90 vs 0.99), the mean change in absolute length (1.4 +/- 0.2 cm) was greater than the change in area (4.5 +/- 1.4 cm2, equivalent to a length of 0.67 +/- 0.2 cm, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percent change in absolute length (26.9%) was greater than the change in area (16%, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discordance of estimates of progression or regression between area and length was found in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The image technique detected no change in the area of squamous islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Imaging analysis can precisely measure the extent of Barrett's including squamous islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Area showed little change, whereas measures of length were more varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Computer based image analysis provides a more precise estimate of interval change of Barrett's </plain></SENT>
