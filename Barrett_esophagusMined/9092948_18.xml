<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently showed, using an ex vivo organ culture system of human mucosal Barrett's esophageal biopsies, that acid has a highly variable effect on cell proliferation and differentiation depending on the pattern of acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study of the mechanisms underlying these dynamic effects of acid on this premalignant intestinal-like epithelium is hampered by lack of an immortalized cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the effect of acid exposure on the human colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line HT29, chosen because of its intestinal cell derivation and its ability to differentiate in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HT29 cells exposed to pH 5 medium either continuously (up to 3 weeks), or as a short (1 hour) pulse, were compared with cells cultured at pH 7.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Villin expression was induced only by long term acid exposure, and correlated with the development of differentiated polarized cells that contain a brush border and microvillus inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> acid exposure arrested cell proliferation, whereas a 1 hour acid-pulse enhanced cell proliferation, as determined by [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation assays and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum starvation attenuated the hyperproliferative effect of an acid-pulse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the doubling time of at least the first cell cycle after an acid-pulse was shortened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Na/H exchanger is likely to play a role since the hyperproliferative acid-induced response was blocked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2639">amiloride</z:chebi>; and the activity of the exchanger was increased at acidic pH as determined by 22Na uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results support a role for extracellular pH on cell proliferation and differentiation of HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these findings parallel the dynamic effects of acid on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and suggest that HT29 cells could serve as an in vitro model for studying the mechanism of acid modulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
