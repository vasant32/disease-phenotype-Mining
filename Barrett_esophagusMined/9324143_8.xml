<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy with extensive lymph node dissection is the best way to give Barrett's patients with locally advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> a good chance of cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients underwent subtotal (n = 47) or distal (n = 8) esophagectomy for Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 43) or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (23.6%) never had had any reflux symptom before disclosure of the neoplastic lesion, and 20 patients (36.4%) had esophageal shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ro resections (n = 50) included removal of the esophageal tube en bloc with the locoregional lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was found in the resected specimen of 4 of the 12 patients operated on for HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the 5 patients whose <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was surveyed endoscopically were operated on for an advanced lesion (T2N1, T3N1) because they had not strictly complied with the proposed schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of the 4 patients whose HGD was followed up endoscopically until disclosure of deeper mucosal invasion had positive lymph nodes at operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of early lesions (Tis, T1, T2, No) was 7.4% in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related symptoms versus 85.7% in those having unrelated symptoms (P = 0.0000), which resulted in a 5-year survival rate of 33.8% and 82.4%, respectively (P = 0.0012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival rate after Ro resection made for invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was 59.3% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases), 73.1% (No), 61.5% (&lt; or =5 positive lymph nodes), and 0% (&gt;5 positive lymph nodes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is an indication for esophageal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early detection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of obstructive symptoms gives the best chance of cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy with radical lymph node clearance is capable of curing a large proportion of the patients having no or a limited number of metastatic lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
