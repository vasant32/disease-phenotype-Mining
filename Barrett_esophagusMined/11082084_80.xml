<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To review the benefit of an endoscopic surveillance programme for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 409 patients in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was identified during 1984-94; 143 were entered into the annual surveillance programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average period of surveillance was 4.4 years; 55 patients were reassessed in 1994 but only eight remained in the programme in 1999, withdrawal being due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (not from <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus), illness, or frailty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of the patients who entered surveillance developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was identified as a result of a surveillance endoscopy, the others being detected during endoscopy to investigate altered symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 266 patients who were not suitable for surveillance, one died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> and 103 from other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surveillance has resulted in 745 endoscopies and about 3000 biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The current surveillance strategy has limited value, and it may be appropriate to restrict surveillance to patients with additional risk factors such as stricture, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, or long segment (&gt;80 mm) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
