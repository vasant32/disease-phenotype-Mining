<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the possible relationship between the depth of infiltration of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, its degree of differentiation and the incidence of lymphatic vessel and venous invasion in early Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this end, a total of 805 endoscopically resected specimens obtained from 472 patients with early Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of this analysis revealed that increasing depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> infiltration is associated with an increase in the incidence of poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>--from 0.8% for lesions limited to the mucosa (m1) to 41.4% when the depth of infiltration extended to the lower third of the submucosa (sm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A similar correlation was also found for the incidence of lymphatic vessel invasion (m1, 0.6%; sm3, 44.8%) and for venous invasion (m1, 0%; sm3, 13.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these observations proved to be statistically highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results show that the degree of differentiation, as well as the incidence of lymphatic vessel and venous invasion, correlates with the depth of infiltration of the early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
