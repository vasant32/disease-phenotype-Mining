<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aberrant expression of small noncoding endogenous <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> molecules known as microRNAs (miRNAs) is documented to occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple cancer</z:e> types including esophageal adencarcinoma (EAC) and its only known precursor, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have linked dysregulation of specific miRNAs to histological grade, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> and metastatic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, we present a summary of previously reported dysregulated miRNAs in BE and EAC tissues as well as EAC cell lines and evaluate a cranberry <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26267">proanthocyanidin</z:chebi> rich extract's (C-PAC) ability to modulate miRNA expression patterns of three human EAC cell lines (JHEso-Ad-1, OE33 and OE19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A review of 13 published studies revealed dysregulation of 87 miRNAs in BE and EAC tissues, whereas 52 miRNAs have been reported to be altered in BE or EAC cell lines, with 48% overlap with miRNA changes reported in tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report for the first time C-PAC-induced modulation of five miRNAs in three EAC cell lines resulting in 26 validated gene targets and identification of key signaling pathways including p53, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, T-cell activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, mutiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> related networks were ideintified as modulated by C-PAC utilizing Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER), and MetaCore analysis tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Study results support the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> inhibitory potential of C-PAC is in part attributable to C-PAC's ability to modify miRNA profiles within EAC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A number of C-PAC-modulated miRNAs have been been identified as dysregulated in BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further insights into miRNA dysregulation and modulation by select <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> preventive agents will support improved targeted interventions in high-risk cohorts </plain></SENT>
