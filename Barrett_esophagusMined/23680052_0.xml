<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE) is a new technique that enables a noninvasive evaluation of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate ECE effectiveness compared with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> (MB) chromoendoscopy for the detection of esophageal lesions in which there was suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, the length and pattern of BE, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with BE who underwent Nissen fundoplication and had a follow-up period of more than five years were prospectively enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent ECE and chromoendoscopy with MB performed by different physicians who were blinded to each of the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ECE sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 100%, 100%, and 79%, respectively, for the detection of esophageal lesions suspected of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECE accuracy in assessing BE length was 89% and in the evaluation of finger-like projections, circumferential BE, and mixed BE was 74%, 79%, and 74%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> detection, ECE sensitivity was 43% and its accuracy was 74% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ECE appears to be a good method for detecting lesions in which there is suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> and it had modest results in regard to the accurate identification of BE length and pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ECE is not a good method for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed in order to define the definitive role of ECE in BE monitoring </plain></SENT>
