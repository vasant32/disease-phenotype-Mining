<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) is involved in oesophageal adenocarcinogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> exerts its biological action by binding to specific receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> receptor subtypes regulate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> signals in the oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression was determined in oesophageal biopsies from 85 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were determined by quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry and western-blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of EP receptors was also determined in response to acid and bile exposure in the Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line OE33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four EP receptors subtypes were expressed in human oesophageal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>COX-2 and, especially, EP2 were increased in the Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of the EP4 receptor protein was increased in oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, expression levels of COX-1 and EP3 receptor were decreased along the sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No differences in EP1 expression were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23614">deoxycholate</z:chebi> increased COX-2, EP1, EP2 and EP4 expression in OE33 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in addition to COX-2, EP2 and EP4 receptors could be a selective target in the prevention and/or treatment of the Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
