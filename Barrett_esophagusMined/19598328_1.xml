<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) is associated with the development of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and endoscopic surveillance is commonly practised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of the clinical, psychological and economic implications of BO, we have studied patients' attitudes towards surveillance, their levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with BO undergoing endoscopic surveillance were asked to complete a questionnaire,including seven questions on their experience of surveillance, the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale,the Trust in Physician Scale (TIPS) and the Short Form-36 quality of life questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 250 patients invited, 178 responded (71%).One hundred and fifty-one (60%) completed the questionnaire sufficiently for analysis [median age 66 (range 41-79) years, 101 male] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine percent of patients had received too little information concerning surveillance of BO and 22% no information at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information was deemed difficult to understand by 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> score: 14%abnormal, 25% borderline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was lower than the general population in seven of eight Short Form-36 parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increasing TIPS score correlated with having received (r= 0.33, P &lt;0.001) and understood (r = 0.2, P= 0.037) BO information, and negatively with the belief that endoscopic surveillance reduced oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> risk (r= - 0.19, P =0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing TIPS score was associated with less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (P= 0.015) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (P =0.001), and better quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing endoscopic surveillance for BO suffer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and have impaired quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As trust in their physicians is correlated with receiving sufficient BO information, we surmise that ensuring BO patients understand their condition is likely to improve quality of life, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
