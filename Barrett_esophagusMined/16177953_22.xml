<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether BO is also associated with a more pronounced humoral immune response when compared to RO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies were performed to quantify the mean numbers of Th2 effector cells (plasma cells and mast cells) and Th1 effector cells (macrophages and CD8(+) T cells) to detect the antibody classes produced by plasma cells (IgA, IgG, IgM or IgE) and to determine the presence of isolated lymph follicles [segregated B and T cell areas, follicular dendritic cells (CD23) and expression of CXCL13] in 124 oesophageal biopsies from 20 patients with BO and 20 patients with RO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of Th2 effector cells was higher in BO than in RO, mainly due to higher numbers of plasma cells and mast cells in BO (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most plasma cells in BO and RO expressed IgG, but several IgE(+) plasma cells were detected in BO: these were rare in RO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In line with this, isolated lymph follicles were observed in 4/20 (20%) patients with BO, but not in RO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore conclude that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> is skewed towards a more pronounced humoral immune response when RO progresses to BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It may be that this shift, which is similar to that found in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory conditions, contributes to an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in BO </plain></SENT>
