<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> developing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) are not always endoscopically identifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular markers are needed for early recognition of these focal lesions and to identify patients at increased risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to correlate increased telomerase activity (TA) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> occurring in the setting of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: Esophageal mucosal biopsies were obtained from patients (N=62) who had pathologically verified BE at esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mucosal biopsies were also obtained from the gastric fundus as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on histopathology, patients were divided into three groups: 1) BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n=24); 2) BE with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (both high grade and low grade, n=13); and 3) BE with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n=25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TA was measured by a PCR-based assay (TRAPezeÂ® ELISA Telomerase Detection Kit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results: TA was significantly higher in biopsies of BE with dyplasia and BE with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> than in BE without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses did not reveal any significant correlations between TA and patient age, length of BE, or presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Telomerase activity in esophageal mucosal biopsies of BE may constitute a useful biomarker for the early detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0000467'>esophageal dysplasia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
