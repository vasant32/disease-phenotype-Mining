<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Preoperative endoscopic assessment of the failed fundoplication is instrumental in diagnosis and surgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy is a routine and essential part of the workup for a failed fundoplication, but no clear guidelines exist for reporting endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to compare endoscopic findings reported by community physicians (gastroenterologists and surgeons) with the findings of the authors (esophageal center) for patients who underwent reoperative intervention after a previous antireflux procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed to identify patients who underwent reoperation after a failed antireflux operation between 1 December 2003 and 30 June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings as reported by the outside physician and by the esophageal center endoscopist were reviewed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 229 patients underwent reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 20 did not have endoscopy performed by an outside physician and were excluded from the study, leaving 208 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic reports of the esophageal center physician included 97 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (64 type 1 and 33 types 2 and 3), 52 slipped fundoplications, 61 disrupted fundoplications, 30 intrathoracic fundoplications, 25 twisted fundoplications, 14 two-compartment stomachs, and 27 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outside physicians identified 68% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> and 61% of the paraesophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> reported by the authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 32% of the outside reports mentioned a previous fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, only 17% of the slipped fundoplications and 30% of the disrupted fundoplications were so described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Outside physicians identified 19 of the 27 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fundoplication changes described by the general endoscopist are inadequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With an increasing population of patients who have undergone prior antireflux surgery, incorporation of fundoplication assessment in an endoscopic curriculum may be helpful </plain></SENT>
