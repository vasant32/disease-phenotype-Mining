<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> are at increased risk of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Observational studies have suggested increase in overall mortality also but data are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were identified retrospectively in four hospitals in Leicestershire, UK using electronic endoscopy and histopathology records from 1997 to 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from this cohort of patients were identified through the Office of National Statistics and compared with age- and gender-adjusted mortality in the Leicestershire region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 1272 Barrett's patients were identified with 245 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality was found to be increased [male standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 552, 95% CI = 466-638; female SMR 455, 95% CI = 357-552] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main disease areas that were responsible for this increase were oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 25, male SMR = 2171, 95% CI = 991-3351; female SMR = 1300, 95% CI = 26-2574), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchopneumonia</z:e> (n = 70, male SMR = 146, 95% CI = 55-236; female SMR = 436, 95% CI = 272-601) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> (n = 51, male SMR = 186, 95% CI = 97-2748; female SMR = 205, 95% CI = 105-306) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> die more commonly of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchopneumonia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> compared with oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and overall mortality in this group may be increased </plain></SENT>
