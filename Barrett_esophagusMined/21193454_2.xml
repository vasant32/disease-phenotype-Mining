<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The mechanism of transformation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> has not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> activate the Cdx2 promoter via nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and stimulate production of Cdx2 protein in oesophageal keratinocytes, resulting in production of intestinal-type mucin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is an important transcription factor in the development of intestinal mucosa and has similar functions as Cdx2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the direct effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> on KLF4 expression as well as the precise mechanisms of expression in cultured oesophageal squamous epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the expression of KLF4 in rat and human Barrett's epithelium specimens, while the response of that expression to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> was studied using a KLF4 promoter luciferase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, oesophageal squamous epithelial cells were transfected with a KLF4 expression vector, after which their possible transformation into intestinal-type epithelial cells was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both rat and human tissues, Barrett's epithelium strongly expressed KLF4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> mixture increased KLF4 promoter activity, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in oesophageal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results from mutation analysis of the KLF4 promoter suggested that the NF-κB binding site is responsible for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>-induced activation of the KLF4 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, KLF4 and Cdx2 stimulated each other by directly binding to the promoter of the other, while transfection of the KLF4 expression vector in oesophageal epithelial cells induced production of MUC2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">Bile acid</z:chebi>-induced sequential expression of KLF4 followed by MUC2 production may have an important role in the development of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
