<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Regular endoscopic surveillance is recommended for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and to diagnose <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> while it is in an early and possibly treatable stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are numerous unknown aspects regarding the natural history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in this disease, and there is still a need for more accurate markers of risk of a malignant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of DNA flow cytometry in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to define subgroups of patients showing similar histologic findings but with a different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Routinely formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues of 43 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were processed for flow cytometric measurements (ploidy, proliferative index) and the results were compared with the histologic evolution observed in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only in the group of patients with "indefinite" <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> did we find statistically significant differences between the samples from patients with and without progression to more severe lesions (mean proliferative index of stable patients: 5.2% versus 8.3% in patients with progression, p = 0.001, Student's t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence in the flow cytometric analysis of a DNA aneuploid cell line is closely related to the presence of severe histologic alterations (i.e., high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>: p &lt; 0.001, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that this procedure is at least capable of distinguishing between a real, although incipient, neoplastic process and morphologic changes of a reactive or reparative type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increment in the tissue proliferative index could be an indicator of an early genomic instability which, with time, will develop into lesions with a more altered DNA content: <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
