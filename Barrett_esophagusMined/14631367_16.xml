<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marked differences exist between the carcinogenic processes in the two locations in terms of natural history and clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated biopsies from 52 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and from 50 patients with gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in an attempt to throw light on their pathogenic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphologic characteristics, presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), and markers of differentiation, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and proliferation were evaluated by histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area covered by incomplete type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and the proportion of sulfomucins were significantly higher in the esophagus than in the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity with MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, Das-1, cytokeratins 7 and 20, inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 antibodies was also significantly greater in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> than in gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, the presence of MUC1, MUC5AC, Das-1 and cytokeratin 7 was restricted to areas with the incomplete type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation (Ki-67) was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> than in gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>H. pylori was absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, while it was present in 70% of the patients with gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our observations made clear that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> shares some phenotypic characteristics with gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, leading us to suggest that both could arise in response to injuries with eventual carcinogenic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the progression to more advanced lesions could be modulated by the nature of the carcinogenic insult </plain></SENT>
