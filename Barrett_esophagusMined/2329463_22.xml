<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was found in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In eight cases, this could also be histologically verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, but no verified <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isotope reflux studies were performed on six patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> having both endoscopically and histologically shown pathology in the cervical esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reflux was provoked by putting patients in different positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient showed gastrotubal reflux, and only in the prone Trendelenburg position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a common complication of gastric tube patients, and is probably due to acid secreted by the tube itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Life-long endoscopic follow-up of these patients is warranted </plain></SENT>
