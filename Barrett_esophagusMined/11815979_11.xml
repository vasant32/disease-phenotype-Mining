<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is known that proliferation is deregulated progressively during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclin B1 is a key protein for the regulation of G2-M-phase transition during the cell cycle and is essential for initiation of mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, samples of Barrett metaplastic specialized epithelium (SE; n = 36 samples), low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD; n = 25 samples), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD; n = 25 samples), and invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (CA; n = 46 samples) derived from 50 esophagectomy specimens were investigated for the expression of cyclin B1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of cyclin B1 positive cells was determined semiquantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, in SE, LGD, and HGD samples, the pattern of cyclin B1 expression was assessed by determination of the presence of positive cells in four mucosal compartments: the deep glandular zone, the lower crypt zone, the upper crypt zone, and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cyclin B1 expression was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding the percentage of positive cells, a marked increase of cyclin B1 positive cells was observed in SE samples compared with LGD samples and in HGD samples compared with CA samples (chi-square test; P &lt; 0.0001), nevertheless showing a broad overlap between the different lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concerning staining patterns, in the majority of SE samples (72.2%), cyclin B1 positive cells were restricted to the glandular zone and the lower crypt zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an expansion of cyclin B1 positive cells to superficially located zones of the mucosa (the upper crypt zone and/or the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface) was observed in the majority of LGD samples (96.0%) and HGD samples (100%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of cyclin B1 is a frequent and early finding in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may contribute to the loss of growth control and, subsequently, to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in this location </plain></SENT>
