<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Late complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> (EA), particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, are increasingly being recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the exception of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, it is unknown whether patient symptomatology can predict endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data regarding the digestive symptoms of patients who were referred to the EA multidisciplinary clinic from October 2005 to October 2008, and underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluation, were systematically collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic and histological findings were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy was considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> if no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005213'>gastric metaplasia</z:mp> (GM) was discerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-three patients underwent endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> related to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> needing dilation and were subsequently excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients (26 girls) with a median age of 7.3 years (range 0.4 to 17.9 years) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (58%) were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at endoscopy, 14 patients (31%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and 16 patients (36%) had GM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients with abnormal endoscopy results were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation between digestive symptoms and endoscopy results was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present cross-sectional study showed that symptomatology was not predictive of abnormal endoscopy in EA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>Esophagitis</z:hpo> or GM may be discovered, even in the absence of symptoms, suggesting that physicians cannot rely solely on symptomatology to accurately evaluate the extent of these esophageal complications in this population </plain></SENT>
