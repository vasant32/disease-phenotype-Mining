<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ongoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> may impair healing and re-epithelialization after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because prior fundoplication may improve reflux control, our aim was to assess the relationship between prior fundoplication and the safety/efficacy of RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RFA Registry, a nationwide registry of BE patients receiving RFA at 148 institutions, to compare the safety and efficacy of ablation between those with prior fundoplication and those with medical management (proton pump inhibition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 5,537 patients receiving RFA, 301 (5.4 %) had prior fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of fundoplication subjects, 1.0 % developed stricture and 1.0 % were hospitalized after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of stricture, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and hospitalization were not statistically different (p = ns) between patients with and without prior fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were achieved in 71 % and 87 % of fundoplication patients, and 73 % and 87 % of patients without fundoplication, respectively (p = ns for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with prior fundoplication needed similar numbers of RFA sessions for eradication compared with those without fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation, with or without prior fundoplication, is safe and effective in eradicating BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prior fundoplication was associated with similar adverse event and efficacy rates when compared with medical management </plain></SENT>
