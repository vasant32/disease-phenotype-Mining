<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> and its powerful oxidant reaction with nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>) generation were determined in esophageal mucosal biopsies from 101 patients with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux diseases</z:e> and 28 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activity of both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and catalase, and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) levels, were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of Cu, ZnSOD, MnSOD and tyrosine-nitrated MnSOD were analyzed by Western blot and/or immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highest levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> generation were found in patients with severe lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">Peroxynitrite</z:chebi> generation was intense in Barrett's biopsies, weaker in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and absent/weak in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of Cu, ZnSOD and MnSOD isoforms were present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa and increased according to the severity of the lesion, reaching the highest level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
