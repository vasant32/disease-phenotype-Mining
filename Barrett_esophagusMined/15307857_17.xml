<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the patterns of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and the spectrum of disease activity in women and compared them to a cohort of disease- and age-matched men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 543 adults, both men and women, referred for evaluation because of symptoms or signs suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were assessed immediately before testing using a standardized symptom questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic, ambulatory pH, and motility findings were categorized and graded according to their extent and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence, nature, and severity of esophageal symptoms and their relationship to endoscopic disease severity were then analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made between the two groups, i.e., 341 men (mean age 54, age range 25-90) and 202 women (mean age 50, age range 22-80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Heartburn without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was noted in 38% of men and 55% of women patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was noted in 28% of men and in 26% of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the magnitude of esophageal acid exposure by pH criteria and motility abnormalities between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of endoscopic stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (0-IV, Savary-Miller classification) was similar between the two groups (p &gt; 0.1, chi2 test) but women were less likely to harbor <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05, chi2 test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Quantitative esophageal symptom analysis revealed significantly higher symptom severity scores for heartburn (p &lt; 0.01), regurgitation (p &lt; 0.05), belching (p &lt; 0.01), and nocturnal (p &lt; 0.01) symptoms in women as compared to men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Women also experienced higher symptoms scores of lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among symptomatic adults undergoing evaluation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, women appear to have generally similar patterns of endoscopic severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> as men but they are less likely to harbor <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The severity of symptoms in women is significantly more than in men and may contribute to earlier disease recognition and different disease management </plain></SENT>
