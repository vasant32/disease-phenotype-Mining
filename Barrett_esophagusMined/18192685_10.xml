<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Severity of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is shown to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) development in animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has therefore been postulated that a strong pro-inflammatory host response predisposes to BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the impact of cytokine gene polymorphisms on the development of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The multiplex SNaPshot method was used to determine interleukin (IL)-12B (A+1188C), IL-10 (C-592A, C-819T, A-1082G), IL-8 (A-251T), IL-6 (G-174C) and IL-2 (G-330T) gene polymorphisms in 255 patients with BE and 247 patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of the IL-12B C-allele, which is associated with increased IL-12p70 expression, was more frequently observed in BE than in RE patients [odds ratio (OR) 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.7; P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of BE was increased in patients in whom the IL-12B C-allele coincided with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.32-6.58; P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IL-10(-1082) GG genotype, which is associated with higher IL-10 levels, was also associated with a decreased risk of BE when it was associated with the IL-12B C-allele, indicating IL-10-dependent down-regulation of IL-12p70 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A combination of the IL-12B AA genotype and the IL-10 AA or AG genotypes was associated with RE (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.05-1.85; P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A genetic profile predisposing to a strong pro-inflammatory host response, mediated by IL-12p70 and partially dependent on IL-10, is associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This risk further increases when this genotype coincides with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, suggesting that exposure to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in the presence of a pro-inflammatory genetic background is a driving force in the development of BE </plain></SENT>
