<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical, endoscopic, and functional results in a group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> undergoing classic antireflux surgery in whom <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were found at a late objective follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: There have been isolated reports of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> undergoing antireflux surgery who show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or even <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 161 patients undergoing surgery, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> developed in 17 (10.5%) at late follow-up and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> developed in 4 (2.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 21 patients represent the group assessed and were compared with 126 surgical patients with long-segment Barrett's in whom <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> did not develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were evaluated by clinical questionnaire, multiple endoscopic procedures and biopsy specimens, 24-hour pH studies, and 24-hour <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 17 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 3 were asymptomatic at the time that dysplastic changes appeared; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients (12%) in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> group had short-segment Barrett's; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had long-segment Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Manometric studies revealed an incompetent lower esophageal sphincter in 70% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> group, similar to nondysplasia patients with recurrence, and in 100% of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 24-hour pH study showed pathologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> in 94% of the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, similar to patients with recurrence without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring showed duodenal abnormal reflux in 86% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, three different histologic patterns were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, with appearance of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> 6 to 8 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who undergo antireflux surgery need close and long-term endoscopic and histologic surveillance because <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or even <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> can appear at late follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Metaplastic changes from fundic to cardiac mucosa and then to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and later to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> can clearly be documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in terms of clinical, endoscopic, manometric, 24-hour pH, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring studies between patients with recurrence of symptoms without dysplastic changes, and patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the high-risk group for the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is mainly the group with failed antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
