<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional treatments for leak include conservative therapy, surgical reoperation, and even complete gastrointestinal (GI) diversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of endoluminal stenting in the management of esophagogastric leak after esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on 18 (11.3%) of 160 patients who developed postoperative leaks after minimally invasive esophagectomy were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications for esophagectomy included <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (n = 14), Barrett's with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 3), and benign stricture (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neoadjuvant therapy was used in 57.1% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first nine patients underwent conventional treatments for leak whereas the latter nine patients underwent endoscopic esophageal covered stenting as primary therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 5 cervical and 13 intrathoracic anastomotic leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures included patient characteristics, types of treatment, length of hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects were 16 males and 2 females with a mean age of 66 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the conventional treatment group, leaks were treated with neck drainage (n = 4), GI diversion (n = 2), and thoracoscopic drainage with or without repair or T-tube placement (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the endoscopy group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leaks were treated with endoscopic covered stenting with or without percutaneous drainage (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Control of leaks occurred in 89% of patients in the conventional treatment group vs. 100% of patients in the endoscopic stenting group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three patients in the conventional treatment group (33%) required esophageal diversion compared to none of the patients in the endoscopy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 60-day or in-hospital mortality was 0% for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our clinical practice, there has been a shift in the management of esophagogastric anastomotic leaks to nonsurgical therapy using endoscopic esophageal covered stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Endoluminal stenting is a safe and effective alternative in the management of GI leaks </plain></SENT>
