<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has potential in diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, in which large areas of mucosa may harbor areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> not visible on conventional or high-definition white-light endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autofluorescence endoscopy technology has evolved from fiberoptic to video technology with a marked improvement in image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although fiberoptic autofluorescence endoscopy seems to provide no advantage over conventional white-light imaging, videobased technology, especially if combined with narrow band imaging, offers great promise for enhancing endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, for this technology to have future clinical applications, image quality still needs to be improved and the false positive rate needs to be decreased further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autofluorescence technology detects indirect measures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and is nonspecific, so additional enhancements are clearly desirable </plain></SENT>
