<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to gain more insight in the process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and to identify which genes are specifically expressed by the epithelial cells and the surrounding tissues in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hereto, the gene expression profile of a BE epithelial primary cell culture was compared to that of a BE biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To specifically obtain the epithelial cell layer, epithelial cells from biopsies of BE were cultured using a Barrett specific culturing medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial analysis of gene expression was applied to obtain a transcription library of the primary epithelial cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transcriptome was analyzed and compared to a previously described transcriptome of a BE biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Validation of results by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed using tissues of 16 BE patients and 16 primary cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over 43,000 tags were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genes specifically expressed by the Barrett epithelial cells were for instance Lipocalin 2 and Cyclin D1, whereas annexin A10, trefoil factor (TFF)1 and TFF2 were specifically expressed in the BE biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The comparison of the gene expression profiles of BE primary cultured epithelial cells with BE biopsy defines a subset of genes that are specifically expressed by the epithelial cells and another subset that most likely is expressed by the underlying stromal tissues in the BE biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
