<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used microsimulation modeling of a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old men in the United Kingdom with histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> symptoms, assuming the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to be 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were invited to undergo screening by endoscopy or Cytosponge (invitation acceptance rates of 23% and 45%, respectively), and outcomes were compared with those from men who underwent no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We estimated the number of incident esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cases prevented and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the different strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients found to have high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> received endotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Model inputs included data on disease progression, test accuracy, post-treatment status, and surveillance protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Supplementary and sensitivity analyses comprised esophagectomy management of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, screening by ultrathin nasal endoscopy, and different assumptions of uptake of screening invitations for either strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We estimated that compared with no screening, Cytosponge screening followed by treatment of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> costs an additional $240 (95% credible interval, $196-$320) per screening participant and results in a mean gain of 0.015 (95% credible interval, -0.001 to 0.029) QALYs and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $15.7 thousand (K) per QALY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The respective values for endoscopy were $299 ($261-$367), 0.013 (0.003-0.023) QALYs, and $22.2K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Screening by the Cytosponge followed by treatment of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> would reduce the number of cases of incident symptomatic esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> by 19%, compared with 17% for screening by endoscopy, although this greater benefit for Cytosponge depends on more patients accepting screening by Cytosponge compared with screening by endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a microsimulation model, screening 50-year-old men with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> by Cytosponge is cost effective and would reduce mortality from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> compared with no screening </plain></SENT>
