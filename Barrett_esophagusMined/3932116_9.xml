<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 159 patients, there were 211 structural abnormalities including 153 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo>, 35 mucosal rings, 20 peptic strictures, and 3 esophageal diverticula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall sensitivity of the full-column technique in detecting these abnormalities was 100% compared to 52% and 34% for the mucosal relief and double-contrast techniques, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the prone full-column technique must be incorporated into any examination of the esophagogastric region if these common abnormalities are to be demonstrated reliably </plain></SENT>
