<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is the precursor to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; the incidence of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is rapidly increasing in Western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few population-based studies of BE have been conducted, so little is known about potentially modifiable causes of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included patients with newly diagnosed BE, confirmed by histology and categorized as simple BE (without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, n = 285) or dysplastic BE (with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, n = 108) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recruited 2 separate control groups: endoscopy patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory changes (<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> controls, n = 313) and population controls sampled from a population register (n = 644) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were collected through standardized questionnaires and telephone interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We fit logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for BE associated with salient exposures by using each set of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to never smokers, risks of simple BE were significantly higher among former smokers (OR, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.59-3.60) and current smokers (OR, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-4.17), compared with population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Smoking conferred more than a 4-fold increase in risk for dysplastic BE; this increase in risk remained long after individuals quit smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found no conclusive association between BE and passive smoking and no evidence of independent associations between body mass index (BMI) and simple BE or dysplastic BE, after adjusting for reflux and other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analyses with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> controls produced qualitatively similar risk estimates for smoking and BMI to those obtained for population controls, but they were markedly attenuated for reflux, as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current and past smoking significantly increases risk for BE, but BMI does not, after adjustment for the effect of reflux </plain></SENT>
