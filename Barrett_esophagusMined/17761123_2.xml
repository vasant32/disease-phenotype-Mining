<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is currently defined as a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes recurrent symptoms and/or complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> has been recognized to be much broader than before, when the typical symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation were considered as the main clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, now it is recognized that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> can present with various other mainly extraesophageal symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, and even <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there is an important overlap with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0559031" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">functional gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">functional dyspepsia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The morphologic spectrum of esophageal involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> encompasses erosive (erosive reflux disease ), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), and nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there is still no consensus on whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> represents one disease that can progress from NERD to ERD and BE, or whether it is a spectrum of different conditions with its own clinical, pathophysiologic, and endoscopic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently published data suggest that mild erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> behaves in a way similar to NERD and that there is considerable movement between these categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But follow-up data also show that after 2 years, some patients with NERD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> Los Angeles A or B went on to develop severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> or even BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A practical approach is to categorize patients with reflux symptoms into "functional heartburn" (ie, reflux symptoms and negative endoscopy and absent objective evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> into the esophagus), NERD (negative endoscopy but positive documentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> into the esophagus), and ERD (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> documented endoscopically) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it appears that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is a disease with a spectrum of clinical and endoscopic manifestations, with characteristics that make it a continuum and not a categorical condition with separate entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is difficult to clearly delineate the spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> based on the clinical, endoscopic, and pathophysiologic characteristics, but therapeutic trials and follow-up studies suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is not composed of different conditions </plain></SENT>
