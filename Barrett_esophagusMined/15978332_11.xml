<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of several clinicopathological parameters with the immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 was analyzed in paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, COX-2 upregulation showed to be a late event and in a multivariate analysis it was associated independently with a reduced survival after surgery compared with low COX-2 expressed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although, the expression was extensively high in well-differentiated parts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, it was not related with a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
