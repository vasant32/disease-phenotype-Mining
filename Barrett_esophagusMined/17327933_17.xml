<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Given its often subclinical course, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) hardly lends itself to epidemiologically stringent evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate risk factors for incident BO diagnosed in a defined population in southeast Sweden while paying particular attention to epidemiological aspects of the study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients (aged 18-79 years) who were endoscoped with new indications at units exclusively responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gastroscopies in defined catchment area populations were invited to take part in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were taken above and immediately below the gastro-oesophageal junction, and exposure information was collected through self-administered questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy-room-based cross-sectional data from 604 patients were supplemented with exposure data from 160 population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations, expressed as odds ratios (ORs), were modelled by means of multivariable logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the comparison with population controls, reflux symptoms and smoking indicated a 10.7- and 3.3-fold risk, respectively, for BO (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5-33.4 and 1.1-9.9, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body mass was unrelated to risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cross-sectional analysis among endoscopy-room patients, reflux symptoms were associated with an OR of 2.0 (95% CI 0.8-5.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association was, however, modified by the subjunctional presence of Helicobacter pylori; although the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was not in itself significantly connected with risk, a combination of reflux symptoms and H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was linked to an almost 5-fold risk (95% CI 1.4-16.5) as compared with the absence of both factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The BO prevalence increased by 5% per year of age (95% CI 1-9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reflux is the predominant risk factor for BO, and proximal gastric colonization of H. pylori seems to amplify this risk </plain></SENT>
