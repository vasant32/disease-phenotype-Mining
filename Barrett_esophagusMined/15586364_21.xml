<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the effect of ablative therapy on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> at cell-cycle and genetic levels </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (23 male and 6 female, mean age 58 years, mean length of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> 4 cm) were treated with APC or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsy samples were obtained at regular intervals (mean follow-up 20 months, range 6-36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One month after the first ablation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was no longer identified, either endoscopically or histologically, in nine patients (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At this time point, significant down-grading was achieved for abnormal chromosome 1 numbers (p = 0.020) and Ki67-defined proliferation (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> were additionally treated with APC, resulting in the elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> in 76% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An abnormal chromosome 1 number and p53 protein overexpression were detected only in the high-grade dysplastic lesion, but increased proliferation was still present in the majority of these persisting cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> may still harbour molecular aberrations and must therefore be considered still to be at risk of progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
