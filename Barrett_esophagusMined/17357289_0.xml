<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> is a feature of atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> whereas the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is based on histological demonstration of specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both conditions are associated with increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess whether magnification endoscopy improves the diagnostic accuracy of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in stomach and in esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this non-randomized, feasibility study thirty one (12 women and 19 men) renal transplant recipients, with a mean age of 44.0 years were evaluated for the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standard esophagogastroscopy with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> staining was followed by magnification endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was classified according to modified updated Sydney classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 31 patients, 16 patients had endoscopic and histopathological evidence of gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and standard endoscopy with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> staining was sufficient for diagnosis (15 from 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnification endoscopy allowed identification of 6 patients with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, which would be otherwise missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study diagnostic accuracy of standard endoscopy for identification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the stomach was not improved by the use of magnification endoscopy, but the latter was an accurate method of predicting specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of magnification endoscopy in the clinical setting of renal transplantation needs further studies </plain></SENT>
