<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic endoluminal radiofrequency ablation is achieving increasing acceptance as a mode of eliminating Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and, thus, reducing the risk of developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is believed that reducing exposure of the esophageal epithelium to acid is essential to achieve long-term ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> or antireflux operations are more effective to accomplish this goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent endoscopic endoluminal radiofrequency ablation with the BARRx device (BARRx Medical, Sunnyvale, CA) were reviewed for date of initial ablation, length of Barrett's epithelium, presence or performance of Nissen fundoplication, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follow-up endoscopy and treatment, and posttreatment biopsy results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized by presence of Nissen fundoplication and presence of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by biopsy at least 12 months following ablation and at last endoscopic follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed by Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 77 patients ablated, 47 had documented endoscopic follow-up at 12 months or longer following the ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 19 patients had Nissen fundoplication before, at the same time, or after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median length of Barrett's epithelium, with interquartile range (IQR), was 3 (2-12) cm in patients with fundoplication compared with 3 (2-7) cm without fundoplication (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 15 (12-24) months in fundoplication patients compared with 12.5 (12-17) months without (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of 19 patients with fundoplication had persistent or recurrent Barrett's epithelium, compared with 7 of 28 without fundoplication (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of patients without fundoplication, those who had persistent or recurrent Barrett's had median Barrett's length of 10 cm (6-12 cm) compared with 3 cm (2-5 cm) in patients who had ablated Barrett's (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up length was similar in those with ablated epithelium, 15 months (12-19 months), compared with those with persistent or recurrent Barrett's, 12 months (12-13 months) (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had fundoplication in conjunction with endoluminal radiofrequency ablation were more likely to achieve durable ablation compared with patients who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It appears that patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are at higher risk for persistent or recurrent Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Consideration should be given for an antireflux operation in patients with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and planned endoluminal radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
