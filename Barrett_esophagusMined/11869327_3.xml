<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been shown previously that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) do not always have increased esophageal acid exposure on 24 h pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recent recognition of <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp> as a sensitive marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> raises the possibility for patients with mild disease to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal acid exposure but inflamed cardiac mucosa on biopsies of the cardia, which may be an early sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, 171 consecutive patients evaluated for symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and no increased esophageal acid exposure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were divided into those with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Esophageal acid exposure and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) characteristics were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were done using the Mann-Whitney U-test for non-parametric data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 82 patients with histologic evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp> and 89 patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp> had a more deteriorated sphincter, determined by overall and abdominal length and resting pressure, and significantly higher esophageal acid exposure (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and histologic evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp> may have early or mild reflux disease, which is confined to the sphincter </plain></SENT>
