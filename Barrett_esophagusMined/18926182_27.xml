<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This noninvasive point imaging system offers a method for obtaining real-time histologic information during endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare images taken with the fiberoptic endoscopic microscope with standard histopathologic examination </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The tissue samples studied in this report were obtained by endoscopic resection from patients with previous diagnoses of either high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three distinct tissue types were observed ex vivo with the endoscopic microscope: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Squamous tissue was identified by bright nuclei surrounded by dark cytoplasm in an ordered pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> could be identified by large glandular structures with intact nuclear polarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was visualized as plentiful, irregular glandular structures and loss of nuclear polarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Standard histopathologic examination of study samples confirmed the results obtained by the endoscopic microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The endoscopic microscope probe had to be placed into direct contact with tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible to obtain high-resolution histopathologic information using the endoscopic microscope device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future improvement and integration with widefield endoscopic techniques will aid in improving the sensitivity of detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
