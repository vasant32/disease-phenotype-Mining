<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168,C0559234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">Esophageal reflux</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> represent two major risk factors for the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that brief exposure of the Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line, SEG-1, or primary cultures of Barrett's esophageal tissues to acid or bile results in changes consistent with cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined whether similar exposure to acid or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> results in gene expression changes that provide insights into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using previously published methods, Barrett's-associated esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines and primary cultures of Barrett's esophageal tissue were exposed to short pulses of acid or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> followed by incubation in culture media at pH 7.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide assessment of gene expression was then determined for the samples using cDNA microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analysis evaluated for statistical differences in gene expression with and without treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SEG-1 cell line showed changes in gene expression that was dependent on the length of exposure to pH 3.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further analysis using the Gene Ontology, however, showed that representation by genes associated with cell proliferation is not enhanced by acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The changes in gene expression also did not involve genes known to be differentially expressed in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar experiments using short-term primary cultures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> also did not result in detectable changes in gene expression with either acid or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> SEG-1 cells or primary cultures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> does not result in gene expression changes that are consistent with enhanced cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus other model systems are needed that may reflect the impact of acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> exposure on the esophagus in vivo </plain></SENT>
