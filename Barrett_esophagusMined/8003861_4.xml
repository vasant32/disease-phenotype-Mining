<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The muscularis mucosae appeared intact beneath the squamous epithelium lining the proximal esophagus in 13 specimens (86.7%), while it became thick and "dual" beneath the metaplastic columnar epithelium lining the distal esophagus in 14 specimens (93.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This dual muscularis mucosae, as well as the metaplastic columnar epithelium, particularly the specialized type, may be part of the specific histological changes characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
