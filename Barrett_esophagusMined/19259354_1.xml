<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to analyze our experience with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From Sep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2003 to Mar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2008, 31 adult Korean patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 360 degrees fundoplication was carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 19 males and 12 females with an average age of 46.8 +/- 17.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Typical symptoms were present in 15 (48%) of patients, and atypical symptoms in 16 (51.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both typical and atypical symptoms were present in 4 of patients (12.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preoperative studies showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> in 13 patients (41.9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 10 (32.3%), and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 18 (58.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean DeMeester score was 17.4 +/- 16.7, mean operative time 206.1 +/- 47.8 min and mean hospital stay 5.2 +/- 2.1 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Perioperative complications occurred in 5 patients (16.1%), including gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, subcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100750'>atelectasis</z:hpo>, and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Gastroesophageal junction stenoses with subsequent endoscopic balloon dilations were required in 5 patients (16.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After surgery, symptoms were completely controlled in 17 patients (54.8%), partially improved in 12 patients (38.7%) and not controlled in 2 patients (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our series, 93.5% of patients had either complete or partial remission of symptom after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Atypical symptoms were more predominant in our Korean patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is an efficacious method of controlling symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, even for those who have atypical symptoms </plain></SENT>
