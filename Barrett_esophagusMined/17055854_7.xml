<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in young individuals is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of suspected BE in children and adolescent patients undergoing endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Prospectively collected data in the Pediatric Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative (PEDS-CORI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We identified patients younger than 20 years of age with suspected BE in the PEDS-CORI between 1999 and 2002; the corresponding histopathologic records were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: We analyzed the distribution of demographic and endoscopic risk factors for BE between cases and non-cases with and without suspected BE in bivariate and multivariable analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a total of 6731 patients who underwent upper endoscopy in 12 pediatric facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 17 patients had suspected BE (prevalence, 2.5 per 1000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was reported in only 9 of these patients (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with suspected BE were older than patients without BE (median 14.7 vs 10.1 years; P = .011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatus hernia</z:hpo> was more commonly recorded in patients with suspected BE (11.8% vs 2.2%; P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression model, both older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.35) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> (OR 4.62, 95% CI 1.03-20.66) were independently associated with suspected BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopically suspected BE is rare (&lt;0.25%) in children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Older age and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> are possible risk factors for BE in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Lack of standardization for identifying and recording endoscopic landmarks </plain></SENT>
