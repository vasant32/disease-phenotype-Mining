<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The progenitor cell that gives rise to Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is not known, nor is it known why the condition is predisposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the contribution of bone marrow stem cells to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in an animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty female rats were given a lethal dose of irradiation followed by tail vein injection of bone marrow cells from male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten days later, the female rats were randomly assigned to undergo either esophagojejunostomy, a procedure that causes reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, or a sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rats were killed at 8 weeks and serial sections of the snap-frozen esophagi were cut and mounted on slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first and last sections were used for histological evaluation and the intervening sections were immunostained for cytokeratin to identify epithelial cells and analyzed for Y chromosome by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluation of the esophagi from rats that had esophagojejunostomy revealed ulcerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and multiple areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FISH analyses showed that some of the squamous epithelial cells and some of the columnar epithelial cells lining the glands of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were positive for Y chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that multi-potential progenitor cells of bone marrow origin contribute to esophageal regeneration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> in this rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
