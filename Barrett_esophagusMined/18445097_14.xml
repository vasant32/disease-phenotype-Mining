<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the variation in practice of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) management in comparison with accepted international guidelines before and after the introduction of a large BE randomized controlled trial (RCT) with protocols including those of tissue sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A validated anonymized questionnaire was sent to 401 senior attending gastroenterologists asking for details of their current management of BE, especially histological sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 228 respondents, 57 individuals (each from a different center) were in the first group to enter the ASPirin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50275">Esomeprazole</z:chebi> (BE) Chemoprevention Trial (AspECT), and we assessed change in practice in these centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety percent of specialists did not take adequate biopsies for histological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 74% would consider aggressive surgical resection for prevalent cases of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE as their first-line choice despite the associated perioperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two percent claim their lack of adherence to guidelines is because there is a need for stronger evidence for surveillance and medical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effect of the AspECT trial: Those clinicians in centers where the AspECT trial has started have improved adherence to ACG guidelines compared with their previous practice (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BE patients now get 18.8% more biopsies compared with previous practice, and 37.7% if the patient is entered into the AspECT trial (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This large study indicates both wide variation in practice and poor compliance with guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because optimal histology is arguably the most important facet of BE management, the improvement in practice in centers taking part in the AspECT trial indicates an additional value of large international RCTs </plain></SENT>
