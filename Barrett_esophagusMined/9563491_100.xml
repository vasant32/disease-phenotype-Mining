<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 is a negative regulator of the cell division cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is expressed at the highest levels during the quiescent (G0) and prereplicative (G1) phases, and its degradation is required for entry into the S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because lack of p27 is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of epithelial and lymphoid origin, we used immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to evaluate the expression of p27 in metaplastic and dysplastic Barrett's epithelium and to assess its prognostic significance in Barrett's associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BAA) of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In metaplastic Barrett's epithelium, p27 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were restricted to the superficial third of glands in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and extended to the lower third in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, expression of p27 message and protein was both increased and full-thickness, in the 23 cases with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> adjacent to BAA and in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> had elevated levels of p27 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, 45 (83%) of 54 invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> had low p27 protein levels (&lt;50% positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low p27 protein correlated with higher histological grade (P &lt; 0.0001), depth of invasion (P = 0.0120), presence of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P = 0.05), and survival (P = 0.0197) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to the nuclear staining, cytoplasmic staining of p27 was noted in 11 of 23 (48%) of cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and in 14 of 54 (26%) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and confirmed, in a subset of cases, by subcellular fractionation of protein lysates obtained from fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic localization of p27 was also associated with decreased survival (P = 0.0239) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Loss of p27 conferred poor prognosis independently of proliferative index, as assessed by Ki-67 (MIB-1) immunostaining, which was not significantly different in survivors versus nonsurvivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results show that: (a) distribution of p27 message and protein parallel one another in metaplastic and dysplastic Barrett's epithelium, suggesting transcriptional regulation of the gene in the nonneoplastic setting; (b) p27 is inactivated in the majority of BAA as a result of either post-transcriptional modification or altered subcellular localization; and (c) loss of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 is associated with parameters of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> and unfavorable outcome in BAA </plain></SENT>
