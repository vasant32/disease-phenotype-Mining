<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical outcomes are increasingly examined in an effort to improve quality and reduce medical error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi>) is a retrospective, claims-derived and population-based database and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Outcomes Project is a prospective, voluntary and specialty surgeon database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that these two sources of outcome data would differ in regard to a single, commonly performed procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi>, a national sample of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonfederal hospital discharges, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> log of the SAGES Outcomes Project were queried for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fundoplications performed between 1999 and 2001 using either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 procedure code 44.66 or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> codes 43280 or 43324 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with an emergency admission, age &lt;17 years, and/or diagnoses for either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both demographic and outcome variables were compared by either t-test or chi-square analysis, with a p value of &lt;0.05 as significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both data sets were comparable for age and gender; however, the SAGES group had a higher rate of teaching hospital affiliation (71 vs 48%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SAGES fundoplications had a consistently higher rate of comorbidities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (2.3 vs 1.1%, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi> fundoplications had a clear trend toward more associated procedures, including cholecystectomy (7.2 vs 2%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complication rates for the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi> data set were higher, including pulmonary complications (1.7 vs 0.5%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences existed between the two data sets for either length of stay or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The two databases indicate that fundoplication is an operation with low morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The SAGES Outcomes Project demonstrated that participating surgeons had a higher affiliation with teaching hospitals, higher reporting of comorbidity, and lower associated procedures than the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53204">NIS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite having more comorbidity and technical difficulty, patients from the SAGES Outcomes Project had equivalent or lower complication rates </plain></SENT>
