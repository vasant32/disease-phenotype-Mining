<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, a condition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus, is associated with an increased risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether endoscopic radiofrequency ablation could eradicate dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and decrease the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a multicenter, sham-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 127 patients with dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in a 2:1 ratio to receive either radiofrequency ablation (ablation group) or a sham procedure (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Randomization was stratified according to the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and the length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes at 12 months included the complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analyses, among patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> occurred in 90.5% of those in the ablation group, as compared with 22.7% of those in the control group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, complete eradication occurred in 81.0% of those in the ablation group, as compared with 19.0% of those in the control group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 77.4% of patients in the ablation group had complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, as compared with 2.3% of those in the control group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the ablation group had less disease progression (3.6% vs. 16.3%, P=0.03) and fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (1.2% vs. 9.3%, P=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients reported having more <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> after the ablation procedure than after the sham procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the ablation group, one patient had upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and five patients (6.0%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, radiofrequency ablation was associated with a high rate of complete eradication of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and a reduced risk of disease progression </plain></SENT>
