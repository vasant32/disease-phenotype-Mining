<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors conducted a case-control study within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population between 2002 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a new diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 296 cases) were matched to persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (n = 308) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and to population controls (n = 309) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary information was obtained from a validated, 110-item food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A principal component analysis was used to identify major dietary patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two major dietary patterns were "Western" (high in fast food and meat) and "health-conscious" (high in fruits, vegetables, and nonfried fish) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When cases and population controls were compared, strong adherence to the health-conscious dietary pattern was inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (odds ratio = 0.35, 95% confidence interval: 0.20, 0.64; fourth vs. first quartile comparison) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, data suggested an adverse effect of the Western dietary pattern on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, although no dose-effect relation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results suggest strong associations between a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
