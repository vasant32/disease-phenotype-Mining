<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study the role that the transcription factor NF-kappaB, a candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>- promoting gene, present on chromosome 4, plays in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, using OE33 cells as a model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we wanted to determine if NF-kappaB was activated by exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi>) in oesophageal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We employed pathway specific cDNA microarrays and real-time PCR, to first identify <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> induced genes and specifically to investigate the role of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An NF-kappaB reporter system was used, as well as an inhibitor of NF-kappaB (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33135">pyrrolidine</z:chebi> dithiocarbamate) to confirm the activation of NF-kappaB by bile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that physiological levels of DCA (100-300 microM) were capable of activating NF-kappaB in OE33 cells and inducing NF-kappaB target gene expression (particularly IkappaB and IL-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other gene expression abnormalities were also shown to be induced by DCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, preliminary experiments showed that NF-kappaB activation by bile occurred at neutral pH, but not at acid pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Acidic bile did however cause over-expression of the c-myc oncogene, as reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, we present data showing that NF-kappaB may be a key mediator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in bile exposed Barrett's tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, neutral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> appear to play a significant part in reflux induced gene expression changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the activation of the survival factor NF-kappaB by bile may be linked to the previous cytogenetic data from our laboratory showing the amplification of NF-kappaB's chromosome (chromosome 4), during Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hence chromosome 4 amplification may provide a survival mechanism for bile exposed oesophageal tissues via NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
