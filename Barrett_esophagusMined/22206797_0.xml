<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the usefulness of endoscopic biopsies in the diagnosis and surveillance of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with BE controlled at the Hospital Cl√≠nic from February 2002 to March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 493 endoscopies were performed in 206 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We excluded 86 patients who had undergone one endoscopy only, hence the final sample consisted of 117 patients (mean age 61 [12] years, 73% men) with 407 endoscopies and a mean follow-up of 45 (38) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients had a short-BE (49%), 28 a long-BE (24%) and 32 (27%) could not be inferred from the report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 25 cases (21%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) was not detected at the endoscopic index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, biopsies were negative for IM at some point in 45 patients (38.4%) and there was a change in the histologic grade in 100 cases (24.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of a short-BE (43% in short-BE vs 7% in long-BE, P=.001) and few biopsies (3 [1.5] vs 6.2 [4.5]; P=.005) were associated with a higher frequency of negative biopsies for IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Random endoscopic biopsies are not a good tool for diagnosis and surveillance of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
