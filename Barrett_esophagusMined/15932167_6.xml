<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A recent randomized study has shown that the long-term effects of continuous medical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitor</z:chebi> are comparable to those of open fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the long-term effects of anti-reflux surgery with those of medical care according to clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a questionnaire-based 3-10 years follow-up study of 373 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> operated on in two hospitals with either open or laparoscopic fundoplication, and pair-matched non-operated controls treated medically according to clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The controls were matched for hospital, age, sex, follow-up time, degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The questionnaires used for symptoms and health-related quality of life (QoL) were the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale and the Psychological General Well-Being Index, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response rates were about 80%, and 179 pairs of operated patients and controls remained for analysis (102 based on laparoscopic and 77 on open fundoplication) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independently of the surgical technique, the operated patients suffered at the follow-up from significantly (p &lt;0.001) fewer reflux symptoms than the non-operated controls, the mean scores being 1.34 and 2.51, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The operated patients suffered from slightly more symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">indigestion</z:e> (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No consistent significant differences between the groups were found for QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in QoL in favor of the operated patients were found when dealing only with the 43 pairs with no concurrent disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study shows that in our area anti-reflux surgery is more effective in relieving reflux symptoms than medical care according to clinical practice </plain></SENT>
