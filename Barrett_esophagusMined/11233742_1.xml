<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: High-resolution imagery of 900 nuclei from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric tissue, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, Barrett's high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyometric features were computed, and nuclear signatures and lesion signatures for these lesions were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A progression curve was defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Esophageal lesions were distinctly different from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric fundus tissue, with nuclei from Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> deviating from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> almost as much as nuclei from high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was considerable case-to-case variability and overlap between lesions histologically assigned to different diagnostic categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The karyometric data suggest that Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is a more developed lesion than previously assumed </plain></SENT>
