<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Periodic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> occurs in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) due to tissue damage from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> acid-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> and may select for early adaptations to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, including upregulation of glycolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared rates of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in four cell lines derived from patients with BE (CP-A, CP-B, CP-C and CP-D) in response to metabolic inhibitors and changes in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that cell lines derived from patients with more advanced genetically unstable BE have up to two-fold higher glycolysis compared to a cell line derived from a patient with early genetically stable BE; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines preserve active mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In response to the glycolytic inhibitor 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi>, the most glycolytic cell lines (CP-C and CP-D) had the greatest suppression of extra-cellular acidification, but were able to compensate with upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, these cell lines showed the lowest compensatory increases in glycolysis in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> uncoupling by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42017">2,4-dinitrophenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, these cell lines also upregulated their oxidative phosphorylation in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> via the Crabtree effect, and demonstrate a greater range of modulation of oxygen consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that cells from premalignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> tissue may adapt to an ever-changing selective microenvironment through changes in energy metabolic pathways typically associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
