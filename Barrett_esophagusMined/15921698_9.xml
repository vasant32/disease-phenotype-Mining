<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: External esophageal perfusion (EEP) with the idea that esophageal perfusion can be controlled with a single ingredient at a constant rate and concentration, might be used to dissect the injurious role of gastro-duodenal secretions for the progression from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is to evaluate the EEP rat model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> induced by using a micro-osmotic pump with bile perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen adult rats underwent the EEP procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bile (0.5% bovine bile, pH 7.4) was used as perfusion agent and three types of perfusions were performed: 1 week perfusion, 2 weeks perfusion, and 4 weeks perfusion compared to saline perfusion and sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological changes, cell proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">Manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (MnSOD) were observed after perfusion and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The bile perfusion for 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks induced mucosa infiltration of inflammatory cells, basal cell hyperproliferation, and papillae <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathology and cellular changes consistent with the findings associated with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic index, the proliferating index, and expression of 8-OH-dG were significantly increased in the esophageal mucosa compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MnSOD expression was decreased with bile perfusion compared to saline controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The external esophageal perfusion model enabled precise control of the injurious agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It induced the typical histological injury and cellular changes seen in severe reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cellular changes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, proliferation and anti-oxidant defense make this model unique for reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
