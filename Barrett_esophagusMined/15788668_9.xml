<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) is increasing faster than any other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we first show that EA can be distinguished from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (NE) and esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> by plotting expression values for EpCam, TFF1, and SBEM in three-dimensional Euclidean space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For monitoring progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) to EA, we developed a highly sensitive assay for limited quantities of tissue whereby 50 ng of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> are first converted to cDNA using 16 gene-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a set of training tissues, we developed a novel quantitative three-tiered algorithm that allows for accurate (overall accuracy = 61/63, 97%) discrimination of BE versus EA tissues using only three genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gene used in the first tier of the algorithm is TSPAN: samples not diagnosed as BE or EA by TSPAN in the first tier are then subjected to a second-tier analysis using ECGF1, followed by a third-tier analysis using SPARC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of TFF1 and SBEM to the first tier (i.e., a five-gene marker panel) increases the overall accuracy of the assay to 98% (62/63) and results in mean molecular diagnostic scores (+/- SD) that are significantly different between EA and BE samples (3.19 +/- 1.07 versus -2.74 +/- 1.73, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that relatively few genes can be used to monitor progression of BE to EA </plain></SENT>
