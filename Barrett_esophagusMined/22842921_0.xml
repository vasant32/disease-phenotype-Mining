<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A prospective cohort study was conducted to analyze whether self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> predicts overall survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> Registry between September 2001 and January 2009 who completed a baseline quality of life instrument were eligible for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> component was scored on a 0-10 scale, with 0 as extreme <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized as having a decreased energy level if they reported a score of ≤ 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> scores ≥ 6 reflect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from a total of 659 enrolled patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 392 (59 %) and 267 (41 %) patients reported decreased and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> energy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis indicates patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> energy had improved 5-year survival compared to patients with decreased energy (37 vs 28 %, hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with locally advanced disease, the same relationship was seen (28 vs 17 %, HR = 0.67, p = 0.003); this remained significant on multivariate analysis (HR = 0.71, p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A decreased energy level is associated with poor survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients with high levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> should be referred for psychological support and be considered for therapy aimed at amelioration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> symptoms </plain></SENT>
