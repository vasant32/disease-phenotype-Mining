<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the intestine, myofibroblasts have been demonstrated to be essential for epithelial differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is therefore hypothesized that myofibroblasts may also be involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> that is characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study endeavors to immunohistologically evaluate epithelial-myofibroblast interaction in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen archival esophageal endoscopic biopsies of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> were immune-phenotyped for the following epithelial and myofibroblast antigens - cytokeratins (CK) 8, 13, 18, CDX2 (Caudal type homeobox 2), a-smooth muscle actin (SMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: alpha-SMA immunostaining revealed close association between myofibroblasts and metaplastic Barrett's epithelium but not with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myofibroblasts were more prominent in dysplastic than in non-dysplastic Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CDX2 and CK 8/18, indicators of intestinal differentiation were expressed in Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous epithelium, while the reverse was the case for CK 13, which only stained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although their precise role is yet to be clearly defined, sub-epithelial myofibroblasts are very likely involved in the pathogenesis of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
