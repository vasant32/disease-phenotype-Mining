<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze clinical, abdominal ultrasound, upper digestive endoscopic, esophageal manometric and prolonged esophageal pH-monitoring findings in patients with typical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included a total of 251 patients with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data, Body Mass Index, abdominal ultrasound aspects and upper digestive endoscopic data are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Manometry and esophageal pH-monitoring were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-hundred-and-seventy-two patients were female (68.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age of the total was 51.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound examination revealed colelithiasis in 23 patients and PC in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 177 patients (71%), with an average size of 3.0 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was found in 168 patients (66.9%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 23 patients (9.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 131 patients (52.3%) while only 37 patients (14.7%) did not present either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean extension of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) was 2.6 cm, whereas in 132 patients (52.6%) the LES was shorter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean pressure of the LES was 18.9 mmHg; 46 patients (18.3%) had pressures below 14 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean number of reflux episodes on prolonged esophageal monitoring was 42.9; the mean number of prolonged episodes of reflux was 4.6, and the mean percentage of total acid time was 8.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DeMeester scores were high in 175 patients (69.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms, factors influencing the presence of pathological reflux as confirmed by prolonged esophageal pH-monitoring were: age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> associated to erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, a smaller extension, low baseline pressure and smaller volume vector of the LES </plain></SENT>
