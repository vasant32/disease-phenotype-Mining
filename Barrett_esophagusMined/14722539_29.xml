<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation is one of several techniques used to ablate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation in the ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in patients who have undergone antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 40 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who had undergone a fundoplication were entered into a prospective, randomized, unblinded study comparing <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation with endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment was repeated until either no Barrett's epithelium remained or a maximum of 6 treatment sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One month after the final treatment, complete ablation was achieved in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 8, a reduction of over 95% was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient died at 9 months of an unrelated cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, one patient with residual Barrett's epithelium regressed completely, while relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was seen in another because of fundoplication failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Buried glands were observed in 35% patients at 1 month, but only 5% at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was never seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the surveillance group, partial regression was observed in 11 patients, and, in 3 with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, regression was complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> increased in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> initially, but this was not evident at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, complete ablation was achieved in 12 of 19 (63%) patients in the ablation group and 3 of 20 (15%) in the surveillance group (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The effects are durable, and buried glands may resolve with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up is required to assess the impact of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
