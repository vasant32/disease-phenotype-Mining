<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the relative importance of the operative approach used for a fundoplication, as well as the successful elimination of reflux symptoms on long-term quality of life in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire, including the medical outcome study short-form health survey (SF-36), was completed by 105 patients who had undergone either a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (n = 72) or a transthoracic Nissen fundoplication (n = 33); median follow-up was 25 and 31 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as completely or incompletely relieved of reflux symptoms based on the frequency of reflux symptoms and the use of acid-suppression medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients selected for transthoracic Nissen fundoplication had significantly worse preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> based on the presence of a large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, or stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term quality of life was similar for the two approaches, but was significantly decreased in patients with recurrent reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication patients, transthoracic Nissen fundoplication patients were less likely to use acid-suppression medication and tended to be more satisfied with their operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term quality of life was independent of the invasiveness of the procedure, but significantly dependent on successful elimination of reflux symptoms and the necessity for acid suppression medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent a transthoracic Nissen fundoplication, despite having more advanced disease preoperatively, tended to have less reflux symptoms and less long-term acid-suppression medication usage after their procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings support the continued use of a transthoracic antireflux procedure in patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
