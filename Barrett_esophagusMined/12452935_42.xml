<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and endoscopic data were collected prospectively from consecutive patients who underwent upper endoscopy between 1997 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with endoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> were graded according to the Los Angeles system and analysed according to their clinical presentation, endoscopic details, Helicobacter pylori status, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> history, co-morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 22,628 upper endoscopies were performed in 16,606 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 631 (3.8%) had endoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, 14 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">benign oesophageal stricture</z:e> (0.08%) and 10 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (0.06%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients (94%) had either Los Angeles grade A or grade B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who died during follow-up had a significantly higher incidence of co-morbid illness (100% vs. 63%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By Cox regression analysis, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> (P = 0.008), advanced age (P = 0.004) and the use of Ryle's tube (P = 0.043) were identified to be independent factors associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Complicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> is uncommon in the Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Advanced age, use of Ryle's tube and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> are associated with a poor long-term outcome, which is a reflection of the severe underlying co-morbidity </plain></SENT>
