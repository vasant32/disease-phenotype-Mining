<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: A world-wide recognised and accepted definition and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) would be highly desirable for research and clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this project was to develop such a generally accepted definition and classification that could be used equally by patients, physicians, and supervisory bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In order to ensure a consensus among the participating experts a modified delphi process with a step-wise selection modality was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this the working group of five persons formulated a series of statements on the basis of a systematic search of the literature using three databases (Embase, Cochrane-Study register, Medline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then these statements were developed further for two years, revised and finally passed as consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The consensus group consisted of 44 experts from 18 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each key vote was held on the basis of a six-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A "consensus" was considered to have been reached when two-thirds of the participants voted in favour of the respective statement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The level of agreement between the experts increased in the course of the multistep decision process, in the individual voting steps requiring at least two-thirds of the participants, the results were at first 86%, then 88% through to 94% and finally 100% in favour of the chosen statement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the final voting, 94% of the final 51 statements were accepted by 90% of the consensus group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> statements were accepted unanimously or with only minor reservations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> was defined as a disease that is associated with troublesome symptoms and/or complications on account of reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The complaints are divided into esophageal and extra-esophageal syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among the novel aspects of this definition are the patient-orientated approach that is independent of endoscopic findings, the classification of the ailment into independent syndromes as well as the consideration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023067" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngitis</z:e>, cough, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and dental problems as possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a new definition of suspected or demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Irrespective of country-specific differences in terminology, language, prevalence and manifestations of this disease, evidence-based, world-wide valid consensus definitions are possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A global consensus definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> will simplify disease management, make mutual research possible and help in the design of generally valid studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This will not only help the patient but also the physician and supervisory bodies </plain></SENT>
