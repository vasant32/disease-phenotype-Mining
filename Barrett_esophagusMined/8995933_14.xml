<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to assess the role of reflux of duodenal contents in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a study to quantify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e>, using 99mTc-HIDA quantification in gastric juice after continuous intravenous infusion of the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study contained 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (10 uncomplicated and 10 complicated by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and/or stenosis), 10 patients with peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (two grade I, four grade II, and four grade III, according to Savary-Miller), and 10 healthy volunteers who made up the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When we considered the groups overall, we observed that the 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had higher reflux rates (p &lt; 0.01) than either the 10 patients with peptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, or the 10 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> presented higher reflux rates than uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, although the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, on analyzing the results after considering the groups case by case, we see that the mean reflux rate in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> groups is due to five patients presenting much higher rates than the rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> might be involved in the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and its related complications, although only in certain cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is probably multifactorial, and other factors must be involved </plain></SENT>
