<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BE in the general population is uncertain because upper endoscopy is required for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the prevalence of BE and possible associated risk factors in an adult Swedish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A random sample (n = 3000) of the adult population (n = 21,610) in 2 municipalities was surveyed using a validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire (response rate, 74%); a random subsample (n = 1000; mean age, 53.5 years; 51% female) underwent upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic signs suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) were defined as mucosal tongues or an upward shift of the squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BE was diagnosed when specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was detected histologically in suspected CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BE was present in 16 subjects (1.6%; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-2.4): 5 with a long segment and 11 with a short segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 40% reported reflux symptoms and 15.5% showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>; 103 (10%) had suspected CLE, and 12 (1.2%) had a visible segment &gt; or = 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BE in those with reflux symptoms was 2.3% and in those without reflux symptoms was 1.2% (P = .18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, the prevalence was 2.6%; in those without, the prevalence was 1.4% (P = .32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alcohol (P = .04) and smoking (P = .047) were independent risk factors for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BE was found in 1.6% of the general Swedish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Alcohol and smoking were significant risk factors </plain></SENT>
