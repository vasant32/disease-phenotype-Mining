<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence of gastric differentiation (expression of Pepsinogen II and/or gastric mucin) was found in more than 50% of the Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the cardia, but only in 20% of the subcardial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High rates of antigen expression were found for the "intestinal" markers CA 19-9 (between 55.5% and 100%) and BW 494 (between 42.9 and 86.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CK-20 expression was detected to a significantly higher degree in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (73.3%) than in the other groups (between 29% and 44.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> with gastric and/or intestinal differentiation at the esophagogastric junction forms a continuum without clear-cut borders </plain></SENT>
