<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the consequences of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, six patients with esophageal mucosal biopsies showing dysplastic Barrett's mucosa in the absence of clinically evident <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> were identified and their clinicopathologic features reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients, four men and two women, averaged 60 years and had long histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; two had low-grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic Barrett's mucosa appeared to arise most commonly from specialized-type Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 29 months, four patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, had esophageal resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the four were found to have invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, which extended through the esophageal wall in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient had a noninvasive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> ("Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>"), an infrequently described form of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> had developed no clinical indications of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results confirm that dysplastic Barrett's mucosa, particularly the high grade, is a morphologic marker for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biopsy surveillance of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is histologically feasible, but prospective studies are required to prove its effectiveness </plain></SENT>
