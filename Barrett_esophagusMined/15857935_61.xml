<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological data suggest that the incidence of BO is rising but it is unclear whether this reflects a true rise in incidence of BO or an increase in detection secondary to more upper gastrointestinal endoscopies performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to examine the changes in BO incidence relative to the number of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies performed in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using the Integrated Primary Care Information database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This general practice research database contains the complete and longitudinal electronic medical records of more than 500,000 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 260 incident cases of BO were identified during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of BO increased from 14.3/100,000 person years in 1997 (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.6-22.4) to 23.1/100,000 person years (95% CI 17.2-30.6) in 2002 (r2 = 0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies decreased from 7.2/1000 person years (95% CI 6.7-7.7) to 5.7/1000 person years (95% CI 5.4-6.1) over the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This resulted in an overall increase in detected BO per 1000 endoscopies from 19.8 (95% CI 12.0-31.0) in 1997 to 40.5 (95% CI 30.0-53.5) in 2002 (r2 = 0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> increased from 1.7/100,000 person years (95% CI 0.3-5.4) in 1997 to 6.0/100,000 person years (95% CI 3.3-10.2) in 2002 (r2 = 0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of diagnosed BO is increasing, independent of the number of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies that are being performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This increase in BO incidence will likely result in a further increase in the incidence of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in the near future </plain></SENT>
