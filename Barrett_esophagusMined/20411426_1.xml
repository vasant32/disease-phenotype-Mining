<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms and acid-related mucosal damage has not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To better quantify risk of acid-related mucosal damage among patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study using 10 sites from the Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative (CORI) National Endoscopy Database surveyed patients undergoing EGD by telephone within 30 days on medical history, symptoms and demographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>Varices</z:mpath> and feeding tube indications were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acid-related damage was defined as any of these findings recorded in CORI: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> (unless non-acid-related etiology); healed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, duodenal, gastric or <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcer</z:mp>; stricture; and mucosal abnormality with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,569 patients, 16% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 95% being type 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients were significantly more likely to be male, older and have a higher body mass index, and less likely to report frequent heartburn and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) use between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In unadjusted analyses, diabetic patients had a similar risk for acid-related damage than non-diabetic patients (OR 1.09; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.42) which persisted after adjusting for gender, age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, acid indication and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use (OR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No difference in risk of acid-related mucosal damage was found, even after adjustment for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data do not support the need for a lower threshold to perform endoscopy in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
