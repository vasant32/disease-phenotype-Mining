<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a further 16-h study (divided into 2-h periods) in which AET was correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> and trypsin concentrations in esophageal aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients had greater nocturnal AET than controls (22.7 versus 0.9%, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a stricture had a greater AET than patients with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (25.2 versus 13%, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between esophageal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentrations and AET, and total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentrations were similar regardless of whether a 2-h period contained alkaline episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentrations were no different, in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, stricture, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trypsin was found in only 5% of aspirates, and could not be predicted by AET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that measurement of AET is not useful in the clinical evaluation of duodeno-esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and trypsin are not important in the pathogenesis of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
