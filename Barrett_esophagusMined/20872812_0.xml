<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Both endoscopic and surgical treatments are recommended for m3- or sm1-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus, depending on patients' lymph nodal status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lymphatic dissemination is related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltration depth, but varying incidences have been reported in m3- and sm1-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study aim was to investigate whether the presence of occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in lymph nodes could explain this variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-three node-negative (N0) patients with early esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (m2/m3/sm1-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multilevel-sectioning of lymph nodes was performed; sections were stained by means of immunohistochemistry with cytokeratin marker CAM5.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two pathologists searched for micrometastases (0.2-2.0  mm) and isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (ITCs, &lt;0.2  mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive CAM5.2 staining in lymph nodes was not seen in any of the 18 m2-patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2/25 m3-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (8.0%) an ITC was found, but no micrometastases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells were identified in 4/20 sm1-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (20.0%): three micrometastases and one ITC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 121 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two m3-patients (3.2%) died due to disease recurrence, including one patient in whom an ITC was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lymphatic migration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells was found in node-negative m3- and sm1-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus (8.0% and 20.0%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical relevance of these occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells should become apparent from large series of endoscopically treated patients </plain></SENT>
