<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Porfimer is an intravenous (i.v.) injectable photosensitizing agent used in the photodynamic treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the pharmacokinetics as well as the safety profiles of porfimer after a first and a second dose administered 30-45 days apart in patients undergoing photodynamic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients (16 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath>) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Porfimer <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> was administered by i.v. injection over 3-5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected prior to starting i.v. drug injection and postdose at different time points after the first and second administrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Porfimer exposure values after the second administration were statistically higher than those observed after the first administration, suggesting a slight accumulation of porfimer following repeated administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The apparent mean elimination half-life of porfimer increased from 410 h after the first administration to 725 h after the second administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The safety profiles of porfimer after a first and a second administration were similar and did not raise additional concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients experienced nine serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000992'>photosensitivity</z:hpo> was deemed study-drug related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Porfimer appears to display a safe and tolerable profile when used in patients requiring a second photodynamic therapy within 45 days </plain></SENT>
