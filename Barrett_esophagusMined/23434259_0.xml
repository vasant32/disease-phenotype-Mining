<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Immunohistochemical profiles of esophageal and cardia <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> differ according to the presence or absence of Barrett's epithelium (BIM) and gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (GIM) in the fundus and antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different lymphatic spreading has been demonstrated in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the correlation among the presence or absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the esophagus and stomach and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024232" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphatic metastases</z:e> in patients who underwent radical surgery for esophageal and cardia <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mucosa surrounding the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and the gastric mucosa were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BIM+ patients underwent subtotal esophagectomy and gastric pull up, and the BIM- patients underwent esophagectomy at the azygos vein, total gastrectomy, and esophagojejunostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The radical thoracic (station numbers 2, 3, 4R, 7, 8, and 9) and abdominal (station numbers 15 through 20) lymphadenectomy was identical in both procedures except for the greater curvature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred ninety-four consecutive patients were collected in three major groups: BIM+/GIM-, 52 patients (26.8%); BIM-/GIM-, 90 patients (46.4%); BIM-/GIM+, 50 patients (25.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients (1%) were BIM+/GIM+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 6,010 lymph nodes were resected: 1,515 were recovered in BIM+, 1,587 in BIM-/GIM+, and 2,908 in BIM-/GIM- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with pN+ stations 8 and 9 was higher in BIM+ (p=0.001), and the percentage of patients with pN+ perigastric stations was higher in BIM- (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The BIM-/GIM- patients had a number of abdominal metastatic lymph nodes higher than did the BIM-/GIM+ patients (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to the presence or absence of BIM and GIM in the esophagus and cardia, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> correspond to three different patterns of lymphatic metastasization, which may reflect different biologic and carcinogenetic pathways </plain></SENT>
