<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated cell proliferation and p53 expression and their correlation in the development and progression of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PCNA and p53 expressions were analyzed in biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry including patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, BE, BE with concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and a control group without any histological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progressive increase in cell proliferation and p53 expression was found in the sequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While cell proliferation was significantly lower in the control group compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups, there was no increase in p53 expression of esophageal tissues that were negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic BE tissues revealed significantly higher cell proliferation and p53 expression levels compared to BE, reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or BE with concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both, cell proliferation and p53 expression were significantly higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> compared to BE or Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, while just BE with concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> showed significantly higher p53 expression levels than BE, both, BE with concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> revealed significantly higher cell proliferation levels compared to BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alterations of cell proliferation and p53 expression showed a strong correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous activation of cell proliferation and p53 expression strongly suggest their association with esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205853" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">epithelial tumor</z:e> genesis and particularly, their specific role in the biology of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Quantification of these parameters in BE is thought to be useful to identify patients at higher risk for progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
