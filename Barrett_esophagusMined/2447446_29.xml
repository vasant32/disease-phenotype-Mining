<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The experience with a selective approach in 52 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in this location is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were squamous cell, 13 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and seven <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 19, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was not resectable and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients died within a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 19 patients, a palliative resection could be done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was 31% at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient was alive after 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initially, 16 patients with noncircumferential lesions on endoscopy and/or no evidence of spread to mediastinal lymph nodes on computed tomographic scan were considered to have potentially curable lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were less than 75 years old and had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second greater than 1.5 L and a resting ejection fraction greater than 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A curative resection consisting of an en bloc thoracic esophagectomy, mediastinal lymphadenectomy, and an 80% gastrectomy with abdominal lymphadenectomy was performed in 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The left colon was used to reestablish the gastrointestinal continuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> discovered at operation, and the curative en bloc resection was abandoned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Absence of full wall penetration or involvement of four or fewer regional nodes, or both, was correctly predicted by preoperative and intraoperative staging in 86% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality of a curative en bloc resection was 7% (1/14), and the actuarial survival rates were 76%, 66%, and 53% at 1, 2, and 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Inferences are made from these results on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics associated with survival, the extent of resection necessary for cure, the difficulty of accomplishing a curative en bloc resection by the transhiatal approach, the contraindication to curative en bloc resection, and the need for a surveillance program for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
