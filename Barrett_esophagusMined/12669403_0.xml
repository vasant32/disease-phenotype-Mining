<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic ultrasonography led to the diagnosis of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> with a depth of invasion corresponding to T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While surgery was indicated, it was not considered feasible because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pleural adhesions</z:e> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857427" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">old tuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, chemotherapy with TS-1 at the dose of 80 mg/day (4-week therapy followed by a 2-week withdrawal period) and CDDP at the dose of 3 mg/day (4-week of 5-day therapy followed by a 2-day withdrawal period) was instituted, followed 3 weeks later by the addition of radiotherapy with 1.8 Gy/day (5 times/week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up endoscopy revealed evident reduction in the lesion size 73 days after the start of TS-1 therapy, and complete disappearance of the lesion 185 days after the start of therapy </plain></SENT>
