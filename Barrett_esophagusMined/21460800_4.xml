<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship of HER2 amplification in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with prognosis has not been well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The scoring systems for clinically evaluating HER2 in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> are not established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of the study were to establish a HER2 scoring system and comprehensively investigate HER2 amplification and overexpression in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and its precursor lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a tissue microarray, containing 116 cases of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 34 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 18 cases of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 15 cases of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, HER2 amplification and overexpression were analyzed by HercepTest and chromogenic in situ hybridization methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amplification frequency in an independent series of 116 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> samples was also analyzed using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our studies, we have found that HER2 amplification does not associate with poor prognosis in total 232 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients by chromogenic in situ hybridization and high-density microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further confirm the similar frequency of HER2 amplification by chromogenic in situ hybridization (18%; 21 out of 116) and SNP 6.0 microarrays (16%, 19 out of 116) in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HER2 protein overexpression was observed in 12% (14 out of 116) of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 7% (1 out of 15) of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No HER2 amplification or overexpression was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> HER2 protein overexpression cases showed HER2 gene amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gene amplification was found to be more frequent by chromogenic in situ hybridization than protein overexpression in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (18 vs 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A modified two-step model for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> HER2 testing is recommended for clinical esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> HER2 trial </plain></SENT>
