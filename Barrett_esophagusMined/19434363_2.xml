<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of duodenogastroesophageal reflux (DGER) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies of reflux have compared patients with an intact stomach to those without intact stomach after gastroesophageal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate differences of the refluxate between patients with and without prior gastroesophageal surgery and to assess the role of DGER in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred patients (34% with reflux symptoms) were divided into four groups: 23 with an intact stomach, and 27, 42, and 8 with esophagectomy followed by gastric tube reconstruction, distal gastrectomy, and total gastrectomy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reflux symptoms were evaluated, and endoscopy and simultaneous 24-h monitoring of esophageal pH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 44 patients with increased DGER but without increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, three had severe reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and seven had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DGER was most frequent under weakly acidic conditions in the intact stomach, esophagectomy, and distal gastrectomy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> and DGER at any pH were elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with an intact stomach, while weakly acidic and alkaline DGER were elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients after gastrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy patients had reflux with the combined characteristics of those in the intact stomach and gastrectomy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Weakly acidic or alkaline DGER was correlated with symptoms and esophageal mucosal changes in gastrectomy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The refluxate causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> differed between patients with and without prior gastroesophageal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Weakly acidic or alkaline DGER may cause both symptoms and esophageal mucosal damage </plain></SENT>
