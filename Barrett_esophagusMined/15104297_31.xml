<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) functions as an axonal guidance molecule in the developing <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, and recent work has identified NRP-1 up-regulation in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined for the first time NRP-1 expression in a large variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002672'>gastrointestinal carcinomas</z:hpo> and precursor lesions to determine whether NRP-1 up-regulation correlated with invasive growth in this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein expression and localization of NRP-1 were studied by immunolabeling and semiquantification in &gt;300 dysplastic, invasive, and metastatic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, and confirmation of NRP-1 protein expression was performed by Western blot analysis on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NRP-1 expression was limited within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, with prominent labeling present only in endothelial cells, pancreatic islet cells, and the most apical colonic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Invasive cancer</z:e> of the esophagus, gallbladder, ampulla of Vater, pancreas (<z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> and exocrine), and colon, however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> demonstrated striking NRP-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NRP-1 was also identified in precursor lesions of gastrointestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the spectrum of precursor lesions, a progressive increase in both intensity and area of expression was evident during histologic progression from low-grade to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, the most intense up-regulation of NRP-1 was apparent at or around the point of invasion, with focal expression of NRP-1 at levels equivalent to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> (2- to 3-fold increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prominent labeling for NRP-1 was apparent in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancers</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, and a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e>, with a 2- to 3-fold increase of NRP-1 over dysplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that increased expression of NRP-1 occurs in gastrointestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and in a subset of high-grade precursor lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This up-regulation appears to parallel invasive behavior and may therefore be used as a potential marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> in this system </plain></SENT>
