<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to determine whether race and ethnicity can be identified as risk factors for the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a single center retrospective cross-sectional analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent upper endoscopy during a 1-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a prior endoscopy within 5 years or known BE or EAC were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Suspected cases of BE were confirmed by pathology report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2100 patients met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whites (37.7%), blacks (11.8%), and Hispanics (22.2%) comprised the majority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whites had a significantly higher prevalence of BE than Hispanics (6.1% vs 1.7%, P = .0002) and blacks (6.1% vs 1.6%, P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, factors associated with decreased risk of BE were black race (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.97) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.18-0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male sex (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.20-2.87), reflux symptoms (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.84-4.45), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (OR, 3.53; 95% CI, 2.17-5.72), and older age were associated with increased risk of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who undergo upper endoscopy, blacks and Hispanics have a significantly lower prevalence of BE compared with whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These differences in prevalence are comparable to the relative incidence rates observed with EAC, implying that progression from BE to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> does not vary by race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reasons for lower rates of BE in Hispanics and blacks need further investigation </plain></SENT>
