<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to assess the long-term outcome after this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, seven of them with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, underwent APC and received 40 mg <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> daily for eradication of the metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the treatment period, patients were randomly assigned to receive 20 or 40 mg <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> daily for long-term acid suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological and endoscopic changes were evaluated annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to test the following 10 variables as predictors of sustained reversal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at the end of follow-up: age, gender, length of diseased segment, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, circumferential nature of lesion, presence of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at initial biopsy, number of coagulation sessions, result of pH monitoring under protein pump inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) treatment, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> dosage, and initial response to therapy (after 1 month) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 36 months (range 12 - 48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic and histological relapse rates at 1, 12, and 24 months, and end of follow-up were, respectively, 30 % and 44 % (12/39 and 17/39), 57 % and 54 % (16/28 and 15/28), 60 % and 57 % (17/28 and 16/28), and 62 % for both rates (23/37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to multivariate analysis, shorter length of diseased segment and normalization of pH with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment were the only independent predictors of sustained long-term re-epithelialization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the seven patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, four experienced relapse after 1 month, and during the long-term follow-up, one was lost to follow-up and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the others experienced relapse, but only one developed low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> was found in two cases after 12 and 18 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> and greater length of diseased segment are the major factors associated with a high relapse rate after successful initial reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>APC for ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cannot be recommended </plain></SENT>
