<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A rat model was developed recently in our laboratory to study the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and its progression to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent esophagoduodenal anastomosis (EDA) to produce gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenal reflux</z:e> in their distal esophagi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were given iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> (50 mg of Fe/kg, i.p.) starting 2 weeks after surgery and this was continued once a month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BE was observed as early as week 3 and the incidence of BE and EAC increased with time: 58 and 17% at week 23; 91 and 73% at week 31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a progression in epithelial cell proliferation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> from mild to severe in the distal one-third of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>Iron deposition</z:mpath> in the esophagus also increased with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Iron deposits in the stromal tissue adjacent to the epithelium in the distal one-third of the esophagus were associated with areas of severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) expression in the stromal macrophages directly beneath the epithelium in the distal one-third of the esophagus in 36, 83 and 100% of the rats at weeks 17, 23 and 31, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant increasing linear trend (P=0.001) was seen in nitrotyrosine immunostaining (number of positive cells/high power field) in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strong positive nitrotyrosine staining was seen in the macrophages and weaker positive staining was seen in the adjacent epithelium starting at week 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, iron supplemented rats killed at week 31 had significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, cell proliferation, iNOS and nitrotyrosine as well as more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in their distal esophagi than did rats that received no iron supplement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that iron supplementation enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These processes could contribute to the formation of BE and its progression to EAC </plain></SENT>
