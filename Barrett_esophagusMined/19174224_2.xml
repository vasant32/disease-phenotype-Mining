<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A preliminary run separates analytes in the first capillary based on size (CSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following that, fractions are electrokinetically transferred across an interface into a second capillary, where components are further resolved according to hydrophobicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to succeed in this analysis, two orthogonal methods should be selected for the different modes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transfers from the first to the second capillary must be efficient in order to reduce tailing effects and lost of resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report a new method to improve the resolution with our 2DCE instrumentation using CD doped buffers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> beta cyclodextrin (mbetaCD) is added to the 2DCE interface buffer a stacking effect is described in the transfers from the first to the second dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to that, changes in retention times are observed when proteins form complex with CD's helping in the separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Protein fingerprints were obtained from BE homogenates using this method in presence of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> beta cyclodextrin (mbetaCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within-day and between-day precision has been studied in order to establish the reproducibility of the methodology proposed </plain></SENT>
