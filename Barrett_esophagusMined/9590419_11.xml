<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BE in Hispanics is not known, but it is assumed to be lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of BE in Hispanic patients and to compare demographic and endoscopic characteristics with Caucasian patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Records of patients undergoing an EGD between October 1993 and October 1996 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were included in the study only if they had columnar-appearing esophageal mucosa at endoscopy and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> with Alcian blue-staining goblet cells on biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An extensive chart review was performed in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 75 new cases of BE discovered: 60 (80%) were Caucasians, 6 (8%) Hispanics, 1 (1.4%) Native American, and 8 (10.6%) patients with either unknown or unconfirmed ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 75 patients, 74 male, and the mean age was 65 +/- 11.4 years (range 36-92 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BE in Caucasians and Hispanics undergoing EGD for any reason was similar (5.3% and 3.8%, respectively, P = 0.563) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BE in patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms was also similar between Caucasians and Hispanics (25% and 16%, respectively, P = 0.304) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The two groups did not differ significantly with respect to age, symptoms, habits, or endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the prevalence of BE among Hispanic patients is similar to Caucasian patients, an unexpected finding </plain></SENT>
