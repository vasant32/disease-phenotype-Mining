<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This poor reproducibility appears to be associated with erratic variations in electroosmotic flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One cause of electroosmotic flow variation is degradation of the capillary coating caused by the extremely basic solution commonly used during mobilization and focusing; this degradation of the capillary coating can be reduced by employing a CAPS mobilization buffer at pH 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another cause of variation is protein adsorption to the capillary wall, which causes an increase in electroosmotic flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of protein adsorption can be reduced by use of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="35195">surfactants</z:chebi> in the buffer and by employing an extremely low sample loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report the use of CAPS mobilization buffer in combination with an ultrasensitive laser-induced fluorescence detector for the reproducible analysis of âˆ¼2 ng of protein from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> biopsy </plain></SENT>
