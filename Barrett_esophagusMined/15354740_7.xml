<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared cytokeratin (CK) 7/20 and mucin (MUC1, 2, 5AC, and 6) immunopatterns in biopsies from BE (n = 41), CIM (n = 35), and antral gastric IM (AIM, n = 37) to evaluate their roles as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="33295">diagnostic aids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CK7 and CK20 expression was described as absent, patchy (superficial and deep), continuous superficial only, continuous deep only, and diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven different combinations of CK7/20 expression were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since CK20 staining was positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, four main patterns were defined on the basis of the observed CK7 staining as 1, absent; 2, patchy (superficial and/or deep); 3, diffuse; and 4, continuous superficial only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall CK7 positivity (regardless of pattern) was higher in BE and CIM than in AIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CK patterns 3 and 4 were also higher in BE and CIM than in AIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For either pattern 3 or 4, the positive and negative predictive values for BE versus AIM were 95% and 67%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MUC1 was rarely expressed in BE and CIM compared with AIM, whereas the opposite was noted for MUC5AC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MUC2 and MUC6 expression was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, diffuse or continuous superficial CK7 staining is highly characteristic of BE and CIM and contrasts with AIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is, however, not very sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CK20 profiles have no added value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mucin expression also differs between BE and CIM versus AIM, but the specificity of any pattern is insufficient for distinction in individual cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Importantly, CK and MUC expression patterns in BE and CIM are virtually indistinguishable, limiting their use in this differential and raising the question of whether they are biologically related </plain></SENT>
