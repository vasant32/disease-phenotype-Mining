<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and neoplastic lesions &lt;2 cm in diameter and no sign of submucosal infiltration, positive lymph nodes, or distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> underwent diagnostic ER (cap technique) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a T1sm <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in the resection specimen were referred for surgery; those with a T1m or a less invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> underwent additional endoscopic therapy (ER, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, and/or <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation [APC]), or they were followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was performed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">5-aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> and a light dose of 100 J/cm 2 at lambda = 632 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three patients underwent diagnostic ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic treatment was not performed in 5 patients, who underwent surgery (4 T1sm; 1, patient preference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients were immediately entered into a follow-up protocol, and 23 received additional endoscopic treatment (13 additional ER, 19 PDT, 3 APC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic treatment was successful in 26/28 patients; no severe complication was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (median 19 months, range 13-24 months), 5/26 patients had a recurrence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were successfully re-treated with ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up, 26/33 originally enrolled patients (79%) and 26/28 endoscopically treated patients (93%) were in local remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic therapy is safe and effective for selected patients with early stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
