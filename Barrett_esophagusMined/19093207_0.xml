<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We ascertained a group of patients exposed to radiation and/or chemotherapy and an unexposed group to compare the prevalence rates of Barrett's epithelium and multilayered epithelium at the time of endoscopy in these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Barrett's epithelium was found in ten of the 19 (53%) exposed patients, compared to eight of 38 (21%) unexposed subjects (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of 19 (32%) exposed patients had multilayered epithelium, compared to four of 38 (11%) unexposed subjects (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 19 exposed patients (63%) had either Barrett's or multilayered epithelium, in contrast to ten of 38 (26%) unexposed subjects (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with exposure to both chemotherapy and radiation had a significant increase in the risk for Barrett's and/or multilayered epithelium (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests a relationship between exposure to a combination of radiation and chemotherapy and the development of Barrett's and/or multilayered epithelium </plain></SENT>
