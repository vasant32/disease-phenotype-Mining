<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several isoforms of ER-B have been described and are presumed to have different functions, but their distribution in BM and EA is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to determine which ER-B isoforms are expressed in EA and BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sections of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded esophageal tissue from 33 esophageactomy specimens, of which 27 had invasive EA, were stained for the ER-B isoforms ER-B1, ER-B2, ER-B3 and ER-B5 utilizing the immunoperoxidase method ER-B1 was detected in 23 out of 27 (85%) EA compared to 3 out of 14 (21%) Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (BMND) (p =0 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High- and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed a similar ER-beta isoform expression profile to that of EA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers</z:e> invasive through the esophageal wall had a higher percent of cells with cytoplasmic expression of ER-B1 than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> limited to the wall (T3 vs. T1 and T2, p=0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ER-B1, ER-B2, ER-B3 and ER-B5 are overexpressed in EA compared to its precursor lesion BMND, suggesting a significant biological role for steroid hormones in EA </plain></SENT>
