<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a novel technique, confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), has emerged and enabled the endoscopist to perform a real-time histologic assessment of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the accuracy of CLE in diagnosing BE-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> by pooling data of existing trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Science Citation Index and momentous meeting abstracts were searched and evaluated by two reviewers independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pooling data were conducted in a fixed effect model or a random effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight studies involving 709 patients and 4008 specimens were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a per-patient analysis, the pooled sensitivity of CLE for detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.95), and the specificity was 75% (95% CI, 0.69-0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve under the summary receiver operating characteristic was 0.9472 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a per-location analysis, the pooled sensitivity of CLE for detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was 70% (95% CI, 0.65-0.74), and the specificity was 91% (95% CI, 0.90-0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve under the summary receiver operating characteristic was 0.9509 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CLE is a reasonable, promising modality for management of patients with BE; more prospective trials need doing to determine whether it is superior to traditional method in diagnosing BE-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
