<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BE can evolve to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) through low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only generally accepted marker for increased risk of EAC is the presence of HGD, diagnosed on endoscopic biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More specific markers for the prediction of EAC risk are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A tissue microarray was constructed comprising tissue samples from BE, LGD, HGD, and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marker expression was studied by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against CD44, DKK1, CDX2, COX2, SOX9, OCT1, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining was evaluated semi-quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD44 expression decreased in HGD and EAC relative to BE and LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DKK1 expression increased in HGD and EAC relative to BE and LDG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CDX2 expression increased in HGD but decreased in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>COX2 expression decreased in EAC, and SOX9 expression increased only in the upper crypt epithelial cells in HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>E-cadherin expression decreased in EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nuclear beta-catenin was not significantly different between BE, LGD, and HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Loss of CD44 and gain of DKK1 expression characterizes progression from BE and LGD to HGD and EAC, and their altered expression might indicate an increased risk for developing an EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This observation warrants inclusion of these immunohistochemically detectable markers in a study with a long patient follow-up </plain></SENT>
