<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, mutations in APC and CTNNB1 genes were rarely observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, expression pattern of Wnt ligands, Frizzled receptors and APC, as well as the methylation status of the APC, SFRP1 and SFRP2 promoter genes were investigated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa and in preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Promoter methylation of APC was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BE samples and in 95% of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Full methylation of APC correlated with lack of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In EAC, nuclear translocation of beta-catenin was observed regardless of the expression of APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WNT2 expression was higher in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and EAC than in BE, with 20/26 (77%) of the EAC showing high expression of WNT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SFRP1 methylation occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BE samples and in 96% of EAC, while SFRP2 was methylated in 73% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal mucosa samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, (1) alterations of key regulators of the Wnt signaling are frequent in the pathogenesis of BE; (2) the APC and SFRP1 genes are inactivated by promoter methylation in BE; (3) the WNT2 gene is upregulated along the progression from low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to EAC </plain></SENT>
