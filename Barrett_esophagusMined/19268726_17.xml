<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biopsy practice patterns for BE surveillance in the community have not been well-described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a national community-based pathology database to analyze adherence to guidelines and to determine whether adherence was associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 10,958 cases of established BE in the Caris Diagnostics pathology database from January 2002-April 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic, pathologic, and endoscopic data were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was categorized as low grade, high grade, or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adherence was defined as &gt; or =4 esophageal biopsies per 2 cm BE or a ratio &gt; or =2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Generalized estimating equation multivariable analysis was performed to assess factors associated with adherence, adjusted for clustering by individual gastroenterologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2245 BE surveillance cases were identified with linked endoscopy reports that recorded BE length and could be assessed for adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adherence to guidelines was seen in 51.2% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, longer segment BE was associated with significantly reduced adherence (3-5 cm, odds ratio [OR] 0.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.19; 6-8 cm, OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03-0.09; &gt; or =9 cm, OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stratified by BE length, nonadherence was associated with significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection (summary OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to BE biopsy guidelines in the community is low, and nonadherence is associated with significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future studies should identify factors underlying nonadherence as well as mechanisms to increase adherence to guidelines to improve early detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
