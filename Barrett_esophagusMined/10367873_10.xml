<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Patient comparison study in a university-based tertiary care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 236 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> underwent primary antireflux procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients were suspected of having a short esophagus and underwent a transthoracic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 37 patients, a lengthening procedure was necessary to avoid tension on the repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 28 patients were thought-after complete esophageal mobilization-to have sufficient length for a repair without needing a gastroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An abdominal approach (laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication) was performed on 171 patients judged to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Univariate and multivariate analyses of preoperative variables were performed to identify predictors of a short esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On univariate analysis, manometric esophageal length below the fifth percentile of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> was associated with esophageal shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, only the presence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> predicted the need for a Collis gastroplasty (odds ratio, 7.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of 3 cm or greater identified patients in whom the transthoracic esophageal mobilization alone was sufficient (odds ratio, 3.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a stricture was associated with esophageal shortening sufficient to require a gastroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic esophageal mobilization alone was usually sufficient to perform a safe repair without tension in patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> of 3 cm or greater </plain></SENT>
