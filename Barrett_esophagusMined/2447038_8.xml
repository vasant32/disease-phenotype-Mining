<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional histology revealed three different epithelial patterns: gastric atrophic fundic, intestinal and junctional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A mixture of these patterns was present in 28 cases (62%) and the single type was identified in 17 cases (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of three silver staining methods and antibodies to human chromogranins allowed us to identify numerous <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven sera against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the most common hormones stored in the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells of the gut were used to identify the main products of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following immunoreactivities were identified: 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) (in 75% of the studied cases), somatostatin (87%), motilin (31%), pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (PP) (20%), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (20%), gastrin (15%), glucagon (15%), <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> tyrosine tyrosine (13%), secretin (7%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi> (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No cholecystokinin-immunoreactive cells were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that, in Barrett's epithelium, both gastric and intestinal <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells differentiate, in accordance with the variability of differentiation in the non-<z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells present in the different types of columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings provide support for the conclusion that Barrett's epithelium arises from a pluripotential stem cell capable of both gastric and intestinal differentiation </plain></SENT>
