<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the aetiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> or columnar line oesophagus (CLO), remains unknown, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> has been implicated as a factor in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to detect alkaline reflux in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> patients using dual probe pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients with histologically diagnosed CLO, 15 age and sex matched patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> (grade 1-3), and 15 healthy volunteers were studied by dual probe, 18 hour pH monitoring and analysis of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> content of oesophageal refluxate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total acid exposure and acid exposure in the upright and supine postures were greater in CLO subjects than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the number of reflux episodes lasting more than five minutes and the duration of the longest reflux episode were significantly greater in the CLO subjects than the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine subjects with CLO and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e>, however, were not identified as refluxers, although six had a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentration in their oesophageal aspirate higher than the 95th centile value of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the oesophageal pH and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> contents of refluxate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that dual probe pH monitoring is not useful in detecting alkaline refluxers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>pH monitoring, although the only subjective test available to identify acid refluxers, is not a sufficiently sensitive test with which to define alkaline reflux </plain></SENT>
