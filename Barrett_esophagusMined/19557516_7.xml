<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: This study aimed to investigate the frequency of and risk factors for BE in self-referred Taiwanese patients undergoing diagnostic endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 736 consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy for a variety of gastro-intestinal symptoms from February to October 2007 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A standard questionnaire was used to record the clinical characteristics and patient symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">Gastro-esophageal reflux disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) was diagnosed using the Montreal definition, while the Los Angeles Classification and Prague Circumferential and Maximal Criteria were used to assess erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and BE, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four-quadrant biopsies were taken from endoscopically suspected esophageal metaplastic mucosa every 2 cm for histologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight variables were tested using a logistic regression model to identify risk factors for BE in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> was diagnosed in 344 patients, with typical esophageal symptoms noted in 255, reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> syndrome in 107, and extra-esophageal syndrome in 51, while 27 were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients was 49.8 years and 55.5% of them were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six percent (123 of 344) demonstrated erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and 95% were classified as having Los Angeles grade A or B disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BE was diagnosed in 13 patients (3.8% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients), three of whom had dysplastic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the final analysis model, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] = 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-17.7, P = 0.02) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> duration &gt;5 years (OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.2-4.8, P = 0.03) were independent risk factors for the development of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a 3.8% frequency of BE in Taiwanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> and prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> duration are significant risk factors </plain></SENT>
