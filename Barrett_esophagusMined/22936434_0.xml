<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is performed through various approaches, including using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for mediastinal esophageal dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prone technique allows for gravity-aided retraction of the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine perioperative outcomes after prone MIE in relation to patient preoperative comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study from our single tertiary-care center is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between January 2007 and August 2010, a total of 42 patients underwent three-field prone MIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients were male (37 vs. 5 female), with an average age of 68 years (range = 37-87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses for patients who underwent MIE were 35 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, four <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo>, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy was administered to 16 (38 %) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative comorbidities were quantified using the Modified Charlson Comorbidity Index; low risk was defined as a score of 0-2 (23 patients), moderate risk 3-4 (14 patients), and high risk 5 or higher (five patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications were stratified using the Clavien Classification Scale; minor complications were grades 1 and 2 and major complications were grades 3-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median length of hospital stay was 8 days (range = 6-51) and median ICU stay was 2 days (range = 1-26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Average prone surgical time was 108 min (range = 67-198) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven of 42 patients (88 %) were extubated on the day of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five high-risk patients had a complication, three of which were major </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 14 moderate-risk patients had a complication and three were major, and 17 of the 23 low-risk group had a complication with nine being major </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was a total of 15 major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Predominant complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (15) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (five), with four anastomotic leaks and two postoperative 30-day mortalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This series supports using prone MIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Despite a clinical pathway, including immediate extubation postoperatively, there is still a risk of pulmonary complications that appears to correlate with higher preoperative comorbidity scores </plain></SENT>
