<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of both gene mutation and protein accumulation with clinicopathological findings and survival was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 77 samples from 30 esophagectomy specimens with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of patients in longitudinal clinical follow-up were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Different lesions (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous-cell esophageal epithelia were sampled from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues by microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in p53 Exons 5 to 9 were detected by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphisms (PCR-SSCP) and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein was analyzed immunohistochemically from tissue sections adjacent to those used for microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p53 gene mutations were found in 17 and p53 protein accumulation were found in 20 tumor samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> with a p53 mutation, 16 stained positive for p53 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p53 mutations were detected significantly more frequently in high-grade dysplastic than in low-grade dysplastic lesions (77% versus 29%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, nuclear accumulation of p53 was detected in 85% of high-grade and 71% of low-grade dysplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In eight cases with p53 mutation, the mutation identified in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was also detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e>, mainly in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In four cases of p53-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, clones with different p53 mutations were detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither p53 mutations nor p53 protein accumulations were found in metaplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In summary, we found that p53 mutations occurred mainly during the transition from low-grade to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> but not in the nondysplastic Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis of p53 by PCR-SSCP and p53 accumulation by immunohistochemistry were mostly concordant in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and high-grade dysplastic lesions but frequently discordant in low-grade dysplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No correlation between p53 gene mutation or p53 accumulation and clinicopathological findings was observed in this study </plain></SENT>
