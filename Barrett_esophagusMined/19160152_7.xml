<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Stepwise endoscopic circumferential and focal radiofrequency ablation is safe and effective for the eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other techniques, radiofrequency ablation appears to avoid significant esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> or stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate whether radiofrequency ablation has an adverse effect on esophageal function in patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> containing intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and/or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> containing intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After endoscopic resection of visible abnormalities, stepwise circumferential and focal ablation were performed every 2 months up to a maximum of five sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the inner diameter was performed at 1-cm intervals in the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Manometry was performed using a water-perfused sleeve catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compliance was evaluated using the functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP), measuring eight cross-sectional areas within a saline-filled bag with two pressure side holes, one proximal to and one inside the bag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophageal sizing, manometry, and compliance were recorded in patients at baseline and at least 2 months after the final ablation session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, FLIP and manometry measurements were performed in 10 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, without severe complications or ablation-related stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The esophageal diameter was unchanged by the ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lower esophageal sphincter pressure and length and esophageal contraction amplitude before and after ablation were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Baseline compliance was significantly different between healthy volunteers and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Compliance was not, however, significantly changed by ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stepwise circumferential and focal ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is an effective and safe treatment modality for early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> that appears to preserve the functional characteristics of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
