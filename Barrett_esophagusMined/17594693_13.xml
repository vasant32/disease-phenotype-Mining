<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Given the poor survival rate and efficacy of current therapy for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC), there is a need to identify and develop new therapeutic targets for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis (Affymetrix U133A GeneChips, Robust Multi-Chip Analysis) was used to expression profile 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous and 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> biopsies, 7 surgically resected EACs and 3 EAC cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred transcripts representing potential therapeutic targets were identified using the following criteria: significant overexpression in EAC by analysis of variance (p = 0.05, Benjamini Hochberg false discovery rate); 3-fold increase in EAC relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and expression in at least 2 of the 3 EAC cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the list of potential targets we selected TNFRSF12A/Fn14/TWEAK receptor, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor super-family receptor, for further validation based on its reported role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell survival and potential as a target for therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fn14 protein expression was confirmed in SEG-1 and BIC-1 cell lines, but Fn14 was not found to affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell survival after exposure to chemotherapeutics as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, a novel role in EAC was discovered in transwell assays, in which modulating Fn14 expression affected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fn14's potential as a therapeutic target was further supported by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray of patient samples that showed that Fn14 protein expression increased with disease progression in EAC </plain></SENT>
