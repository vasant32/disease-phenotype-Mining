<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of genetic polymorphisms of the interleukin-18 (IL-18) pathway to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most cases of EAC arise in a background of reflux-induced BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic influences in this pathway are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-18 is a multifunctional cytokine implicated in anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor immunity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A number of polymorphisms of the IL-18 and IL-18 receptor-accessory protein (IL-18RAP) genes have been reported to alter gene expression and have recently been linked to inflammatory processes and various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, but have not heretofore been studied in BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two IL-18 promoter polymorphisms -137 G/C and -607 C/A, (rs187238 and rs1946518) and one IL-18RAP polymorphism (rs917997, C/T) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was genotyped in the following groups: EAC, BE, reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (RE), and controls and analyzed for association with disease status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IL-18RAP rs917997C allele is strongly associated with a protective effect in BE (P = 0.0002) and EAC (P = 6 × 10(-7)), which approaches genome-wide levels of significance for allele association without incurring significant multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CC genotype at IL-18RAP locus rs917997 was associated with a protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> (P = 6 × 10(-4), odds ratio (OR) = 0.59, and 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-0.80 for BE; and P = 2 × 10(-6), OR = 0.46, and 95% CI 0.34-0.64 for EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequencies of IL-18-607 C/A were weakly associated with BE (P = 0.02), and this trend was also seen between controls and EAC (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CC genotype was associated with an increased risk of BE (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.98) and approached significance for EAC (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.98-1.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Allele and genotype frequencies at these loci were not significantly different between the RE group and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although no significant association was observed between the disease groups at the -137 G/C locus, the -137G/-607C haplotype was associated with increased risk of BE (P = 0.006) with haplotype frequencies of 55% in controls and 65% in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show a strong association of the IL-18RAP SNP rs917997 locus with BE and EAC and suggestive association of the Barrett's population with the IL-18-607 C/A promoter polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As both of these SNPs have been demonstrated as expression quantitative trait loci affecting expression of the respective genes, this strongly implicates IL-18 signaling in susceptibility to BE and EAC </plain></SENT>
