<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases include Helicobacter pylori-associated gastroduodenal disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, there is a paucity of well-designed longitudinal studies that characterize the natural history of each of these conditions and more importantly identify individuals (i.e., children) who are at risk for serious, long-term adult sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER), the physiological condition, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, the disease, occur frequently during the first 2 yr of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, commonly held "dogma" by pediatricians is the belief that the majority of these children "grew out of their GER or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms." On the contrary, recent evidence suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> in some subjects is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, potentially life-long condition that begins in childhood, and in those in whom disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is early, there may be a higher risk for long-term severe disease sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The article by Orenstein et al., although small in cohort size (N = 19), is the first systematic, longitudinal prospective study that employs both a validated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptom assessment instrument and a histological characterization of <z:mp ids='MP_0003278'>esophageal inflammation</z:mp> via mucosal biopsies of infants during the first year of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The infants, part of a larger therapeutic trial, were originally referred to the investigators for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> evaluation, failed a 2-wk lifestyle modification trial, and were randomized to placebo or intervention (acid suppression and prokinetic therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This placebo cohort was evaluated in follow-up via assessment of symptoms using a validated Infant-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal-Reflux</z:hpo>-Questionnaire (I-GERQ) and esophageal suction biopsy; morphometric characterization of mucosal histology and symptom scores were performed at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the 12-month endpoint, 10 of 19 completed the study without rescue medication and overall symptom scores improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 completers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, none of the 10 completers had normalization of biopsy assessments, i.e., basal cell layer &lt;25% and papillary height &lt;53% of epithelial thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors concluded that although symptoms improved in more than half of infants with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> followed longitudinally, esophageal mucosal histology remained abnormal at the 1-yr evaluation in the absence of pharmacotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lack of concordant improvement of the esophageal histology should raise concern regarding sub-clinical persistence of ongoing esophageal insult, which might in the long-term, predispose the individual to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-related complications, such as strictures, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and/or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this editorial, the implications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> being a life-long disease based on the findings described by Orenstein et al. are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, a description of areas where further research is critically needed is provided namely: (1) population-based, epidemiological studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with appropriate case and control definitions, (2) characterization of genetically "at-risk" individuals (i.e., with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) for severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> sequelae (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>), or potentially, (3) longitudinal, family cohort natural history studies with index pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
