<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repeated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> sessions were required in some patients to accomplish elimination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>Esophageal strictures</z:hpo> occurred in 53% of patients, but were treated satisfactorily with dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Current results using 5- and 7-cm centering balloons has shown a dramatic reduction in the incidence of stricture formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mucosal injury with these balloons is less than with diffusers or shorter balloons that require overlapping of treated areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors are carefully following the patients treated with longer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> balloons to evaluate the long-term effects on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lugol's staining is an important technique to identify residual patches of Barrett's mucosa following <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small residual patches of Barrett's mucosa can be successfully destroyed with Nd: YAG laser therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors' results indicate that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> alone or in combination with thermal ablation can eliminate superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and Barrett's mucosa in many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
