<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> defined by the GCTM-5 monoclonal antibody is a putative marker of hepatic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to analyze further the distribution of the GCTM-5 antigen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> and to characterize the antigen biochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GCTM-5 epitope was specifically expressed on tissues derived from the definitive endoderm, in particular the fetal gut, liver, and pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody reactivity was detected in subpopulations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult biliary and pancreatic duct cells, and GCTM-5-positive cells isolated from the nonparenchymal fraction of adult liver expressed markers of progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GCTM-5-positive cell populations in liver and pancreas expanded greatly in numbers in <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005912'>biliary atresia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasms</z:hpo> arising in these tissues also expressed the GCTM-5 antigen, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006725'>pancreatic adenocarcinoma</z:hpo> in particular showing strong and consistent reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GCTM-5 epitope was also strongly displayed on cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, a precursor to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biochemical, mass spectrometry, and immunochemical studies revealed that the GCTM-5 epitope is associated with the mucin-like <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> FCGBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The GCTM-5 epitope on the mucin-like <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> FCGBP is a cell surface marker for the study of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> differentiation lineages, regeneration, and disease progression in tissues of endodermal origin </plain></SENT>
