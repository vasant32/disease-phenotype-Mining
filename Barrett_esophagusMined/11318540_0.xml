<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of salivary growth factors are found in human saliva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine if salivary growth factors and cytokines are deficient in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen healthy subjects, eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and 13 patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Salivary concentration of EGF, FGF, IL-1, and IL-6 were measured during esophageal saline and <z:chebi fb="63" ids="17883">hydrochloric acid</z:chebi> perfusion and in the postprandial state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in the concentration of EGF or cytokines among the three study groups in each experimental condition or among the three experimental conditions in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FGF basic could not be detected in saliva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these findings do not support the hypothesis that a deficiency in salivary growth factors or cytokines plays a significant role in the development of mild to moderate reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
