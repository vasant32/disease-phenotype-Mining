<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four had a histologically proven <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and EUS was done to assess its ability in preoperative staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 9 of 24 patients (37.5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stenosis could be passed with the endoscope and EUS preoperative findings regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> extension and the presence of enlarged periesophageal lymph nodes were confirmed in those operated on (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo>, a periesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was reliably excluded by EUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, EUS demonstrated a small (less than 1 cm) <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> that could not be visualized with any conventional technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> after operation from periesophageal scar tissue EUS-guided transmural biopsies are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our experience shows that at the present time EUS is the most reliable method to demonstrate small (less than or equal to 1 cm) intra- and extramural esophageal lesions and that it should therefore be applied early in the work-up of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
