<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The binding of wheat germ agglutinin to human tissue was determined to be specific, and we validated this specific binding by successful endoscopic visualization of high-grade dysplastic lesions, which were not detectable by conventional endoscopy, with a high signal-to-background ratio of over 5 </plain></SENT>
