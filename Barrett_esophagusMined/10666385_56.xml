<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To characterize cytogenetic alterations found in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BA) and, more importantly, its premalignant stages, we studied chromosomal imbalances in various lesions in the histologically proposed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using 30 esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> resection specimens, we were able to study 30 areas of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 8 lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we investigated 25 premalignant lesions adjacent to BA derived from a subset of 14 resection specimens including 11 areas of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), 8 areas of low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), and 6 areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM), which were laser-microdissected and studied with CGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To validate the CGH findings, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis on 13 BA with probes specific for HER-2/neu and 20q13.2 were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal alterations most often identified in BA were: gains on 8q (80%), 20q (60%), 2p, 7p and 10q (47% each), 6p (37%), 15q (33%) and 17q (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Losses were observed predominantly on the Y-chromosome (76%), 4q (50%), 5q and 9p (43% each), 18q (40%), 7q (33%) and 14q (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-level amplifications were observed on 8q23-qter, 8p12-pter, 7p11-p14, 7q21-31, 17q11-q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrent chromosomal changes were also identified in metaplastic (gains on 8q, 6p, 10q, losses on 13q, Y, 9p) and dysplastic epithelium (gains on 8q, 20q, 2p, 10q, 15q, losses on Y, 5q, 9p, 13q, 18q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Novel amplified chromosomal regions on chromosomes 2p and 10q were detected in both Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increase of the average number of detected chromosomal imbalances from IM (7.0 +/- 1.7), to LGD (10.8 +/- 2.2), HGD (13.4 +/- 1.1), BA (13.3 +/- 1.4), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> (22 +/- 1.2) was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the detection of common chromosomal alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> and adjacent <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> suggest a process of clonal expansion, the occurrence of several chromosomal changes in an apparently random order relative to one another is striking evidence that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> is more complex than would be predicted by linear models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is probably a reflection of the existence of many divergent neoplastic subpopulations and highlights one of the main problems associated with surveillance of Barrett's patients, namely sampling error </plain></SENT>
