<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine how the expression of caudal type homebox transcription factor 2 (Cdx2) is regulated in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cdx2, mucin (MUC) series (MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6), p53 and E-cadherin expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> specimens were examined by immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isolated clusters of cells from (1) MUC2 and Cdx2-positive intestinal metaplastic mucosa; (2) MUC5AC and MUC6-positive, and MUC2 and Cdx2-negative high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (IMC); and (3) MUC5AC, MUC6 and Cdx2-positive poorly-differentiated invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>) were analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction using sets of primers for detecting methylation status of the Cdx2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most of the non-neoplastic Barrett's esophageal mucosa showing intestinal-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> with or without low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was positive for E-cadherin, MUC series and Cdx2, but negative for p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A portion of the low-grade to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> was positive for E-cadherin, MUC5AC, MUC6 and p53, but negative for MUC2 and Cdx2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The definite IMC area was strongly positive for MUC5AC, MUC6 and p53, but negative for MUC2 and Cdx2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation of the Cdx2 promoter was not observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, while hypermethylation of part of its promoter was observed in hot dipped and IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of a large fraction of the Cdx2 promoter was observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cdx2 expression is restored irrespective of the methylation status of its promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apparent positive immunohistochemical results can be a molecular mark for gene silencing memory </plain></SENT>
