<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective search of the endoscopy database at the University of Florida Health Science Center/Jacksonville for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and its complications from January 1 to March 31, 2001 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> using the LA classification, reflux related complications and self-reported ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data obtained included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> grade, presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcer</z:mp>, stricture and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and endoscopy indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The search identified 259 patients with RE or its complications, of which 171 were non-Hispanic whites and 88 were African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean ages and male/female ratios were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RE grade, <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcer</z:mp>, stricture and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> frequency were likewise similar in the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was present more often in non-Hispanic whites than in African Americans (15.8% vs 4.5%; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heartburn was a more frequent indication for endoscopy in non-Hispanic whites with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> than in African Americans (28.1% vs 7.9%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Distribution of RE grade and frequency of reflux-related <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcer</z:mp>, stricture and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> are similar in non-Hispanic whites and African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Heartburn was more frequently and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> less frequently reported as the primary endoscopic indication in non-Hispanic whites compared with African Americans with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or its complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>African Americans have a decreased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> compared with non-Hispanic whites </plain></SENT>
