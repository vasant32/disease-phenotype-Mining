<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their clinical significance is controversial and p53 accumulation may not correlate with gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study investigates the occurrence of p53 alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo>, the correlation between the analyses at the gene and protein level, and their prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 74 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> (46 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo>, 21 Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, and 7 undifferentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) was studied by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect p53 mutation and accumulation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p53 mutations in exons 5-8 were detected in 53% of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> whereas p53 accumulation was observed in 57% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing SSCP and IHC, there were 27 discordant cases (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, only 20 tumors (27%) did not display p53 mutation and/or p53 accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No associations were found between p53 aberrations and clinicopathologic parameters, including patients age and gender <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type, stage, and grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p53 protein accumulation and p53 gene mutation were not related to patient survival by univariate or multivariate analysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: p53 aberrations are very common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, p53 gene mutation and p53 protein accumulation have a significant discordance, suggesting that p53 function may be inactivated by mechanisms other than mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>p53 aberrations do not independently predict prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
