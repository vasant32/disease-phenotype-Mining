<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiographic, endoscopic, and histologic findings were reviewed in 124 patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>; then <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> esophagrams done at our institution during a 3 1/2 month period were reviewed and presence of a reticular pattern was correlated with available endoscopic and histologic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, the reticular pattern was found in 26% of double-contrast examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve of these patients underwent careful esophageal mapping biopsies: the pattern was in squamous mucosa with ulceration in two, in columnar epithelium with ulceration in six, and in columnar epithelium without ulceration in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the group of 314 unselected patients who had double-contrast examinations, the reticular pattern was found in 26 (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 26 had had endoscopy and biopsy: the site of the pattern was located in a squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in one, in squamous epithelium adjacent to squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in three, in squamous epithelium with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in five (two of whom had columnar mucosa distally), in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa in one, and in columnar epithelium with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reticular pattern is a strong indicator of important <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e>, but is not specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
