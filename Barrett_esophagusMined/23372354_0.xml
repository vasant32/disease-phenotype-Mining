<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Heterotopic gastric mucosa of the proximal esophagus (HGMPE), also referred to as "inlet patch" or "cervical inlet patch", is a salmon colored patch that is usually located just distal to the upper esophageal sphincter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HGMPE is uncommon with endoscopic studies reporting a prevalence ranging from less than one percent to 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most HGMPE are asymptomatic and are detected incidentally during endoscopy for evaluations of other gastrointestinal complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most consider HGMPE as clinically irrelevant entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of HGMPE is mainly acid related or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reported prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1168250" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngopharyngeal reflux</z:e> symptoms varies from less than 20% to as high as 73.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, most of these symptoms are mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant acid related complications such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, ulcerations, structure and fistulization have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although rare, dysplastic changes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in association with HGMPE have also been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have also been reported but the findings so far have been conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There are still many areas that are unknown or not well understood and these include the natural history of HGMPE, risk factors for complications, role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> and factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformations</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up may need to be considered for patients with complications of HGMPE and surveillance if biopsies show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or dysplastic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the overall low incidence of clinically relevant manifestations reported in the literature, HGMPE is a clinically significant entity but further researches are required to better understand its clinical significance </plain></SENT>
