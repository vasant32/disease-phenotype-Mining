<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As recorded in a history of a 65-year old patient at first the stenocardia-mimicking pains occurred a few days after appendectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gastrobulboscopy performed (after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0542052" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary insufficiency</z:e> had been excluded) revealed extensive inflammatory and erosive lesions of the oesophagus and multiple ulcerations of the duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the several authors the rapid manifestation of the inflammatory lesions of the oesophagus may be related to the intubation necessary for laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It may refer particularly to diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control endoscopies showed that a six-week treatment resulted in a total disappearance of mucosal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It might be thoughtful to take into consideration a possibility of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in clinical differentiation of stenocardia mimicking pains in diabetics who underwent the intubation </plain></SENT>
