<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Case studies are presented of fluorescence endoscopy in the upper and lower GI tract to illustrate the ability to detect early-stage lesions that were not observable with white light endoscopy or those in which the assessment of the stage or extension of the lesion were equivocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A new fluorescence imaging system was used in which blue light excites the naturally-occurring fluorescence of tissues (autofluorescence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The system produces real-time, false-color images that combine green and red fluorescence intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In general, abnormal lesions are seen to have an increase in the red-to-green fluorescence intensity compared with surrounding tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This system was evaluated in patients at 4 participating institutions, concurrently with standard white light endoscopy, with or without dye staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Selected cases are presented in which fluorescence imaging identified specific lesions including focal high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Barrett's mucosa, signet ring <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the stomach, and flat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The capability of autofluorescence endoscopy to detect the presence and extent of occult malignant and premalignant GI lesions has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The future development and evaluation of this technology are discussed </plain></SENT>
