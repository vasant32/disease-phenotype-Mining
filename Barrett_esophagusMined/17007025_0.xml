<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To report the endoscopic treatment of large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> of the esophagus and esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cap fitted EMR (EMR-C) was performed in 3 patients with hyperplastic-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_141'>inflammatory polyps</z:mpath> (HIPs) and BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were successfully removed in the 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two patients, with short segment BE (SSBE) (&lt;= 3 cm), the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_605'>metaplastic tissue</z:mpath> was completely excised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 2 cm circumferential EMR was performed in one patient with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> involving the whole EGJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A simultaneous EMR-C of a BE-associated polypoid dysplastic lesion measuring 1 cm multiply 10 cm, was also carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the two patients, histologic assessment detected LGD in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete neosquamous re-epithelialization occurred in the two patients with SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An esophageal recurrence occurred in the remaining one and was successfully retreated by EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EMR-C appears to be a safe and effective method for treating benign esophageal mucosal lesions, allowing also the complete removal of SSBE </plain></SENT>
