<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is associated with a significantly increased risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, but its natural history in the general population is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), the precursor of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, quantifying the risk of incident BE in those with untreated reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> has not been possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed, in a prospective follow-up study with endoscopy, to evaluate the risk of BE in a cohort from the Swedish general population (the Kalixanda Study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Those with endoscopic or histological findings suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and randomly half of those with NERD (n=481) were invited for follow-up investigation including endoscopy and a validated symptom questionnaire 5 years after the initial study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate relative risk ratios (RRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for change in presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 405 subjects available for inclusion, endoscopy was performed in 284 (response rate 70.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of BE was 9.9/1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of those with NERD at baseline (n=113), progression to erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was found in 11; 2 developed BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n=90) progressed to a more severe grade in 12 and to BE in 8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> at baseline was independently associated with BE at follow-up (RRR 5.2; 95% CI 1.2-22.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with being free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> at follow-up, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> is a major risk factor for BE (with a fivefold increased risk) after 5 years in the general population </plain></SENT>
