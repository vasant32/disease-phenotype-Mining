<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The incidence of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has increased steadily over the past few decades, but little information is available on trends in the incidence of its presumed precursor, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The nation-wide registry of pathology reports (PALGA) was used to investigate time trends in the incidence of BO in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) were calculated to examine the magnitude of the changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study comprised 105,283 patients with a first-time biopsy taken from the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 33,365 had BO, 6168 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and 9854 had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus, diagnosed between 1992 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted incidence of BO increased among men by 41% (95% confidence interval (CI) 38-44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among women, the increase was 23% (CI 19-26%) in 1996-99, followed by a slight decline in 2000-03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase was most notable among younger patients (&lt;60 years), whereas the incidence remained stable among men and decreased among women aged 75 or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the number of oesophageal biopsies increased by 21% among men and by 6% among women, the proportion of biopsies with a diagnosis of BO increased to a larger extent, by 33% (CI 30-36%) for men and by 25% (CI 22-29%) for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus increased by 28% for men and by 22% for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a significant increase in the incidence of clinically evident BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although changes in endoscopic practice may partly explain these findings, a true increase in the incidence of BO seems likely </plain></SENT>
