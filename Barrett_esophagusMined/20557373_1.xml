<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate gene amplification and protein overexpression of TopoIIalpha and Her-2/neu in non-dysplastic BO, dysplastic BO, Barrett <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, and chromosome 17 aneusomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-four patients [18 BO, 13 BO with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (five low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, eight high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) and 13 ADC in BO] were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genes (HER-2/neu and TOPOIIalpha) and chromosome 17 were evaluated by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with BO, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between TOPOIIalpha protein overexpression and TopoIIalpha gene amplification, chromosome 17 aneusomy, HER-2/neu gene amplification and HER-2 protein overexpression as well as between HER-2 protein and HER-2/neu gene, TopoIIalpha gene and aneusomy for chromosome17, and between the genes TOPOIIalpha and HER-2/neu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene amplification (HER-2/neu, TOPOIIalpha), protein overexpression (HER-2/TOPOIIalpha), and chromosome 17 aneusomy were associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most BO patients showed no amplification/overexpression/aneusomy for the above genes, proteins and chromosome, with no differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HER-2/neu and TOPOIIalpha amplification/overexpression might discriminate between BO and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
