<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the long-term follow-up evaluation of the preliminary cohort of patients who underwent thermal ablation of Barrett's epithelium with the <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser after anti-reflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) of the esophagus underwent fundoplication (7 laparoscopic Nissen, 1 laparoscopic Toupet, 1 open Nissen) between May 1993 and October 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had an IM less than 3 cm long (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One year after the operation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients were symptom free, had discontinued medications, and had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 24-h pH study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From June 1995 to February 1996, these patients underwent a median of two (range, 1-5) endoscopic procedures with directed mucosal ablation using the KTP laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A comparative cohort of 21 patients (IM length, &lt;3cm; 38%) treated during the same period with fundoplication alone served as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed prospectively with annual or biennial endoscopy and biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were contacted by mail, telephone, or clinic visit annually to determine symptomatic and quality-of-life outcome of antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 6.8 years (range, 6-7.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At this writing, the study patients are alive and well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight of the patients have experienced histologic loss of IM (89%) according to their last biopsy result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient has had regression of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The patients treated with fundoplication alone had a mean follow-up period of 5.6 years (range, 4.7-7.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the last biopsy result, 7 of 21 patients (33%) had no evidence of IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A program of tailored antireflux surgery followed by thermal mucosal ablation causes a loss of IM in a majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This may represent a significant improvement in histologic outcome over that of treatment with fundoplication alone (p = 0.007 Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
