<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of those 10 patients had esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a blinded review of esophagrams (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 using double-contrast technique) from 16 of the 27 patients, only 1 patient was thought to be at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> due to a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> with an adjacent reticular pattern of the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter patient had biopsy-proven Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were thought to be at moderate risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> due to reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and/or distal strictures in 6 and polypoid intraluminal masses in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and/or strictures had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and both patients with masses had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arising in Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, 7 patients who had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or strictures were thought to be at low risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of those 7 had histologic evidence of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the major value of double-contrast esophagography is its ability to classify patients into high-, moderate-, and low-risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to determine the relative need for endoscopy and biopsy in these patients </plain></SENT>
