<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: After resection of the esophagus, staging was performed according to the TNM-classification (UICC 1987) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> tissue specimens were reviewed for the histological differentiation grade and flow cytometry was performed on paraffin embedded tissue according to the method described by Hedley </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant correlation between DNA-ploidy and TNM-stage or histological differentiation grade of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA ploidy, stage and grade as prognostic factors for the survival were evaluated by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA ploidy significantly (p= 0.04) correlated with survival, also univariately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with diploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had 3- and 5-year survival rates of 51% and 25% respectively, as compared to 10% and 0% respectively for patients with aneuploid or tetraploid/increased G2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DNA ploidy is an independent prognostic factor for the survival of patients with an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
