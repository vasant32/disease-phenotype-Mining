<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an endoscopic technique used to eradicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, such ablation can commonly lead to neosquamous epithelium overlying residual BE glands not visible by conventional endoscopy and may evade detection on random biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the capability of endoscopic 3-dimensional optical coherence tomography (3D-OCT) for the identification and characterization of buried glands before and after RFA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twenty-six male and 1 female white patients with BE undergoing RFA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: 3D-OCT was performed at the gastroesophageal junction in 18 patients before attaining complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (pre-CE-IM group) and in 16 patients after CE-IM (post-CE-IM group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence, size, and location of buried glands relative to the squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 3D-OCT provided an approximately 30 to 60 times larger field of view compared with jumbo and standard biopsy and sufficient imaging depth for detecting buried glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on 3D-OCT results, buried glands were found in 72% of patients (13/18) in the pre-CE-IM group and 63% of patients (10/16) in the post-CE-IM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number (mean [standard deviation]) of buried glands per patient in the post-CE-IM group (7.1 [9.3]) was significantly lower compared with the pre-CE-IM group (34.4 [44.6]; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The buried gland size (P = .69) and distribution (P = .54) were not significantly different before and after CE-IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: A single-center, cross-sectional study comparing patients at different time points in treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lack of 1-to-1 coregistered histology for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> OCT data sets obtained in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Buried glands were frequently detected with 3D-OCT near the gastroesophageal junction before and after radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
