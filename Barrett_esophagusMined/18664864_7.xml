<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> can be limited to symptoms (eg, heartburn, regurgitation) or can be more complicated, such as erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of such <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> complications in children is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of endoscopic findings of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children ages 0 to 17 years, 11 months who underwent upper endoscopy that was recorded in the Pediatric Endoscopic Database System-Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative between 1999 and 2002 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic reports that were incomplete or that did not include demographic features, indications for endoscopy, or endoscopic findings were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was defined either descriptively or by the Los Angeles classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Esophageal biopsy was not evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 7188 children who underwent upper endoscopy fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of those, 888 (12.4%) had erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median age of children with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was 12.7 +/- 4.9 years versus 10.0 +/- 5.1 years in those without erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (P &lt;or= 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of those with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 55.2% (490/888) were male, compared with 48.2% (3040/6300) in those without erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was found in 29 of 531 (5.5%) children ages 0 to 1 years and progressively increased to 106 in 542 individuals (19.6%) by age 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was found in 68 (7.7%) of children with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, compared with 157 (2.5%) without erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (P &lt;or= 0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, previous surgery, nodules, foreign body or retained food, and anatomic abnormalities was not significantly different between children with erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> is slightly higher in male children and increases with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In contrast to erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in adults, there were no significant variations according to race or ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> is the only endoscopic observation that predicts erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
