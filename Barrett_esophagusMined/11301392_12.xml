<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Microsatellite instability (MSI) has been documented in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> of the colon, stomach, and endometrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, MSI is associated with defects in the DNA mismatch repair enzymes hMSH2 and hMLH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Defects in these enzymes result in a phenotype characterized by instability of multiple microsatellite repeat sequences throughout the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine the prevalence of MSI in 80 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (BEAd) and to examine the relation of MSI with the clinical and pathologic features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty BEAd were evaluated for the presence of MSI by using the microsatellite markers BAT25, BAT26, D10S219, D10S541, and D10S551 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> also were evaluated for immunohistochemical expression of hMSH2 and hMLH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High levels of MSI were not found in any of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, immunohistochemical expression of hMSH2 and hMLH1 was retained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evidence of low level MSI was found in 16% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In none of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, however, was MSI present in more than two of five loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of MSI did not correlate with patient age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, degree of differentiation, or with patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High level MSI and loss of hMLH1/hMSH2 expression is uncommon in BEAd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A subset of BEAd demonstrate low level MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of low level MSI was not associated with the clinicopathologic features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> examined </plain></SENT>
