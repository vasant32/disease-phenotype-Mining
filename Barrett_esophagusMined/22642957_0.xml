<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The 2011 American Gastroenterological Association diagnostic criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) require the presence of goblet cells in biopsy specimens of columnar mucosa within the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In other countries, patients can be diagnosed with BE based on evidence of columnar epithelium, regardless of the presence of goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects that a broader criteria would have on diagnoses of patients with endoscopically suspected BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also compared the clinical outcomes of patients with and without goblet cells in esophageal biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the University of Chicago Medical Center database to identify 690 patients with no previous history of BE who underwent endoscopic biopsy analysis for BE from 1987 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We collected endoscopy reports, histology results, and chart reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of biopsy specimens analyzed, samples from 258 patients contained goblet cells and 379 did not (53 of the biopsy samples contained only squamous mucosa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients whose biopsy samples contained goblet cells had longer endoscopic columnar segments (mean, 4.6 cm) and more biopsy specimens taken (mean, 5 biopsy specimens) than those without (mean length, 1.6 cm; mean, 4 biopsy specimens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of patients whose biopsy specimens did not contain goblet cells, 35% underwent additional endoscopy; goblet cells continued to be absent in 88% of these (mean follow-up time, 5.8 y; 2.8 additional procedures; mean total biopsy specimens, 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Goblet cells were identified in only 19% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with columnar mucosa less than 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient without goblet cells developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing the requirement for goblet cells would increase the diagnosis of BE by 147% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among patients with short columnar segments, subsequent endoscopy generally does not reveal goblet cells, so the columnar mucosa might represent proximal stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Decreasing the requirement for goblet cells would cause many patients to be inaccurately labeled as BE </plain></SENT>
