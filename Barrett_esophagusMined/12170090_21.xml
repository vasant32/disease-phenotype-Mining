<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the gastric cardia in children and the significance of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in this region are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some investigators propose that the cardia is comprised of mucous glands at birth, whereas others suggest that mucous glands, when present, represent a metaplastic response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the morphologic features of the cardia in a pediatric population and to determine the significance of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in this region by correlating the pathologic features with clinical and endoscopic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Routinely processed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained mucosal biopsies of the cardia from 74 pediatric patients (age range 0.1-18 years; male/female ratio 0.76:1) without endoscopic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were examined for a variety of histologic features, such as the type of glandular epithelium (mucous, mixed mucous/oxyntic, oxyntic), and the amount and type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> both within 1.0 mm and &gt;1.0 mm from the squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with the patients' clinical symptoms and with other histologic features, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, Helicobacter pylori, and the presence of goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that either pure mucous glands (81%) or mixed mucous/oxyntic-type glands (19%) were present within 1 mm of the squamocolumnar junction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients (100%) in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with mixed mucous/oxyntic glands located &lt;1 mm from the squamocolumnar junction were more likely to have goblet cells than were patients with mucous glands alone, but they did not differ with respect to any other feature, including patient age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, both active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the cardia correlated positively with a longer length of pure mucous glands in the gastroesophageal junction region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>carditis</z:mp>), eosinophils correlated with the presence of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (a histologic manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>), whereas increased lymphocytes correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> H. pylori <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, a small amount of pure mucous-type glands is present in the cardia in most pediatric patients, a finding that supports a congenital origin for this type of epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, our finding of an association between length of mucosa occupied by pure mucous glands and active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> suggests that injury and repair related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> may contribute to expansion of the zone occupied by cardia-type mucous glands </plain></SENT>
