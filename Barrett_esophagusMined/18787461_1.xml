<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is an increasingly common diagnosis and cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; risk factors include 'Barrett's epithelium' (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance is most commonly used but is expensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other methods of surveillance have been suggested including nonendoscopic balloon cytology, but are handicapped by relying on cytological techniques; hence the need for a partner technology such as a biomarker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From earlier work we know the most commonly expressed oesophageal stress response proteins are SEP 53, SEP70 and anterior gradient-2 (AG-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We set out to map the expression of these stress response proteins and explore their potential as prototype biomarkers of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n=192) presenting to the endoscopy unit of a large teaching hospital with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> or a known BE were recruited, endoscopically examined and the biopsies obtained were examined for heat shock protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> controls and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> predominantly expressed SEP 53 (76.9/91.95%) and SEP 70 (79.48/89.65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although those with BE expressed AG-2; using this expression as a marker for BE, gives a sensitivity of 65.15% and specificity of 89.68% (positive predictive value of 76.78% and negative predictive value of 84.9%) and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> a sensitivity of 65.15% and specificity of 90.80% (positive predictive value of 84.31% and negative predictive value of 77.45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that AG-2 is preferentially expressed in BE; suggesting its use would allow a screening tool with specificity of around 90% </plain></SENT>
