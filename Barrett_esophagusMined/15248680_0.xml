<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University Teaching Hospital, Yaounde, Cameroon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Patients were identified through a retrospective review of obstetric records of mothers admitted at the centre within the period 1984 to 1996 inclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of eleven cases were identified over a period of thirteen years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most prominent associated defects consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001762'>clubfoot</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002089'>pulmonary hypoplasia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266619" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Potter's facies</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003130'>imperforate anus</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of our patients survived the perinatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study indicates the need for the establishment of a prenatal and cytogenetic infrastructure in Cameroon to enhance early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation</z:e> and chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the meantime, early detection of foetuses with Eagle-Barret syndrome using ultrasound could facilitate timely institutions of antenatal management options and lead to favourable birth outcomes of affected babies </plain></SENT>
