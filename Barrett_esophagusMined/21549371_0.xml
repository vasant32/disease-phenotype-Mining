<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon may present a significant risk for development of metachronous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the safety and efficacy of endoscopic cryoablation therapy for persistent dysplastic BE in patients with complete clinical response after definitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> therapy for EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Radiation and endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> treatment records were reviewed between January 2004 and September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with EAC who had been treated with definitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> therapy followed by cryoablation were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Cryoablation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Reduction in Prague Classification and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> status following cryoablation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications reported at 24 hour after the procedure telephone survey and at subsequent endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After complete clinical response of EAC to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> therapy, the median length of persistent BE was Prague classification C1M4 (C = circumferential extent, M = maximal extent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cryoablation reduced the median length of persistent BE to Prague classification C0M1 (P = .009 with respect to circumferential extent and P = .004 with respect to maximal extent of BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 14 patients had dysplastic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cryoablation resulted in histological downgrading in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 20% (2/10) were reduced to low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 60% (6/10) to BE with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 20% (2/10) to no BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Among patients with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 75% (3/4) were reduced to BE with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 25% (1/4) to no BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The median number of cryoablation treatments administered to the 14 patients evaluated was 1 (mean 1.5, range 1-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six percent (12/14) of patients reported no complaints during the 24 hours after cryoablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No occurrences of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> were reported at surveillance endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Single-center, retrospective design involving a small number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that cryoablation therapy is safe and effective for the treatment of persistent BE after definitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
