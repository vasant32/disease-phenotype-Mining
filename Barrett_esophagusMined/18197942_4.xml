<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our experience, this anastomotic technique was associated with a 12% leak rate and a 48% rate of stricture requiring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if a side-to-side intra-thoracic anastomosis was associated with a lower rate of anastomotic stricture and leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three consecutive patients with distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> underwent a trans-thoracic esophagectomy with a side-to-side stapled intra-thoracic anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall morbidity was 27%, with no anastomotic stricture or leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient died (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time to the resumption of an oral diet was 7 days (range 5-28), and the median length of stay in hospital was 9 days (range 6-45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Trans-thoracic esophagectomy with a side-to-side stapled anastomosis is safe and it is associated with a very low rate of anastomotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We consider this to be the procedure of choice for patients with distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
