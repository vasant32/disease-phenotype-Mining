<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> is the main risk factor for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, but there is no strong support for a protective effect of antireflux surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> that develops with long latency after antireflux surgery might be due to persistent postoperative reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nationwide population-based case-control study in collaboration with 195 relevant Swedish hospital departments and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> registries during the study period 1995-1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frequency-matched control persons were randomly selected from the population register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> study participants were personally interviewed regarding background data, exposures, symptoms, conditions, diseases, surgery, and medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences between cases and controls in the occurrence of daily, long-standing antireflux medication 5 years or later after antireflux surgery were estimated using Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-nine out of 216 (88%) eligible cases of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 820 of 1,128 (73%) controls were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven (3.7%) patients and 8 controls had undergone antireflux surgery at least 5 years before the interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 7 case patients had Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of the case patients had used postoperative antireflux medications continuously (mean duration 10.2 years), while none of the control persons reported such use (P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in mean body mass index between patients with and without postoperative reflux (P = 0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No differences between the patients and controls were found regarding age, sex, body mass index, or tobacco smoking status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> occurring late after antireflux surgery might at least partly be due to persistent postoperative reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further research is required to establish the role of antireflux surgery in the etiology of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
