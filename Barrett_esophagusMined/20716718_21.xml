<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies that showed an association between smoking and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction were limited in their ability to assess differences by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site, sex, dose-response, and duration of cigarette smoking cessation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used primary data from 10 population-based case-control studies and two cohort studies from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's Esophagus</z:hpo> and Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> Consortium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses were restricted to white non-Hispanic men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as having esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 1540), esophagogastric junctional <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 1450), or a combination of both (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; n = 2990) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control subjects (n = 9453) were population based </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations between pack-years of cigarette smoking and risks of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were assessed, as well as their potential modification by sex and duration of smoking cessation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Study-specific odds ratios (ORs) estimated using multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, education, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, were pooled using a meta-analytic methodology to generate summary odds ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The summary odds ratios demonstrated strong associations between cigarette smoking and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OR = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.64 to 2.34), esophagogastric junctional <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.84 to 2.58), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.83 to 2.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a strong dose-response association between pack-years of cigarette smoking and each outcome (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with current smokers, longer smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> after adjusting for pack-years (&lt;10 years of smoking cessation: OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.60 to 1.13; and &gt; or =10 years of smoking cessation: OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sex-specific summary odds ratios were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is associated with increased risks of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction in white men and women; compared with current smoking, smoking cessation was associated with reduced risks </plain></SENT>
