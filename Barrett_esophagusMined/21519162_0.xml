<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>Polyploidy</z:mp> often occurs during cell fusion, abortive cell cycle, and endoreplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most tetraploid cells are engaged to apoptotic pathway, but some remaining stable tetraploid cells consequently cause aneuploidization and <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether tetraploid cells could acquire survival advantage and hold a dominant position for natural selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We established tetraploid cell line (HCT116GH) from parental diploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line (HCT116) via <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-mediated cell fusion and compared its cell viability, cell cycle response and apoptotic fractions responded to H₂O₂) with diploid HCT116 and p53 suppressed HCT116/H6 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, plating efficiency and clonogenicity, we evaluated the survival of each cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tetraploid cell line HCT116GH demonstrated an 83 fold greater resistance to 100 microM H₂O₂ than the parental diploid HCT116, and 6 fold greater than even the p53 negative diploid HCT116/E6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cellular sensitivity, G2/M arrests, and apoptotic proportion were observed less in response to H₂O₂ in HCT116GH compared with HCT116 and HCT116/E6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HCT116GH expressed lower level of p53 and p21 than diploid HCT116 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stable tetraploid cell lines showed enhanced viability in comparison to parental diploid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The enhanced viability observed in tetraploidization surpassed that from downregulation of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Frequent appearance of tetraploid cells in stressful condition can be caused by natural selection owing to their enhanced viability and may consequently contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell transformation </plain></SENT>
