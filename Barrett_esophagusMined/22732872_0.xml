<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of EMR before RFA for nodular BE with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> [HGD] or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> [IMC]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University of North Carolina Hospitals, from 2006 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 169 patients with BE with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>: 65 patients treated with EMR and RFA for nodular disease and 104 patients treated with RFA alone for nonnodular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: EMR, RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy (complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, total treatment sessions, RFA treatment sessions), safety (stricture formation, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and hospitalization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EMR followed by RFA achieved complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and complete eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in 94.0% and 88.0% of patients, respectively, compared with 82.7% and 77.6% of patients, respectively, in the RFA-only group (P = .06 and P = .13, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The complication rates between the 2 groups were similar (7.7% vs 9.6%, P = .79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strictures occurred in 4.6% of patients in the EMR-before-RFA group. compared with 7.7% of patients in the RFA-only group (P = .53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study at a tertiary-care referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients treated with EMR before RFA for nodular BE with HGD or IMC, no differences in efficacy and safety outcomes were observed compared with RFA alone for nonnodular BE with HGD or IMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>EMR followed by RFA is safe and effective for patients with nodular BE and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
