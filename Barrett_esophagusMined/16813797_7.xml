<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The global gene expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in comparison to adjacent or histologically similar tissues has not been extensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of conducting gene arrays in endoscopically obtained mucosal specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional feasibility study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The Houston Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We collected endoscopic biopsies from BE, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, antrum, duodenum, and sigmoid colon from 5 patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted and subjected to cDNA microarrays and gene expression was compared between BE and control tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-PCR was conducted to confirm some of the findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Gene expression profiles in BE tissues and 4 control sites: squamous esophagus, antrum, duodenum, sigmoid colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On average, 2 biopsies by disposable jumbo biopsy forceps provided approximately 5 microg required for microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From the original number of 22,283 gene probes, 13,805 genes had a quality score of P &lt; .05 and were subjected to further comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BE gene expression clustered most closely with that of antrum and least closely with squamous esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 587 genes that had significantly different expression between BE and duodenum, 246 were upregulated and 341 were downregulated in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expression of genes involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, negative regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> was significantly lower in BE compared to squamous esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the gene groups were significantly overexpressed in BE compared to squamous esophagus or antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The reverse transcription-PCR confirmed the results of microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Small sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microarray-based studies are feasible in endoscopically obtained tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Differences in gene expression could identify potential markers and shed light on the pathogenesis of BE </plain></SENT>
