<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 'Barrett's specialist clinic' was set up in our institution consisting of a specialist nurse, research fellow, and a consultant gastroenterologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to examine the impact of this clinic in the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with the diagnosis of BE seen in the outpatient departments or in the endoscopy unit were referred to this clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Guidelines were introduced modelling the American College of Gastroenterology recommendation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed based on their comorbidity and willingness to undergo surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reflux symptom control and acid suppression was addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were invited to undergo high-resolution enhanced magnification endoscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e>) and targeted biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to form a management plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the appointment in the clinic, patients were given an option to fill a questionnaire that inquired about the information given to them regarding BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty-three patients (92 men, mean age: 62 years) with a diagnosis of BE were seen in the specialist clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients surveillance was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 25 patients treatment was changed due to poor control of reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients (51%) answered the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five patients (58%) underwent high resolution <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients, had a histological upgrade after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e>, in spite of a short mean screening interval (5.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 'Barrett's specialist clinic' introduced a more structured approach in our institution and changed the way these patients were managed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate the need for local guidelines and Barrett's specialist clinics in the UK, and perhaps in the rest of the Western world, wherein the burden of this condition is increasing </plain></SENT>
