<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both occur predominantly in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in this sex distribution is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed to determine whether there is an association between abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and risk of BE and if present was it modified by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A structured interview and anthropometric measures were conducted within a population-based case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recruited 237 BE cases (70% male) and 247 population controls, frequency matched by age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the overall group and males, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> [waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and waist-height ratio (WHtR)] were strongly associated with risk of BE (Overall: WC OR 2.2 95% CI 1.4-3.5, WHR 1.8 95% CI 1.2-2.9, SAD 2.3 95% CI 1.4-3.7, WHtR 1.9 95% CI 1.2-3.0, males WC 2.5 95% CI 1.4-4.3, WHR 2.4 95% CI 1.3-4.2, SAD 2.5 95% CI 1.4-4.3, WHtR 1.9 95% CI 1.1-3.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were minimally attenuated by adjusting for ever-symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (GER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest in males, non-GER factors related to abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may be important in the development of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In females, there was modest association between measures of abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and risk of BE but these were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abolished after adjusting for ever-symptoms of GER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The power to detect differences between sexes in the risk of BE associated with abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was limited by the number of females in the study </plain></SENT>
