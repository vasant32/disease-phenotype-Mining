<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was comprised of a retrospective (Part 1) and a subsequent prospective (Part 2) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Part 1, Gram stains were performed on esophageal biopsy specimens obtained in 47 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bacteria were quantitated from 0 to 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Part 2, Gram stains and cultured <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> counts of esophageal biopsies were obtained in 18 GERD patients (9 with BE and 9 without BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Part 1 results were as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bacteria were found in 37 of 47 esophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> stain scores for BE (2.5 +/- 0.2) were higher than for non-BE (1.5 +/- 0.3; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The quantitative <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> stain scores correlated with increasing severity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (r = 0.37, P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Part 2, bacteria were found in 8 of 18 esophageal biopsies by Gram stain (6 of 9 patients with BE vs. 2 of 9 non-BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The distal esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> stain scores in BE patients (1.6 +/- 0.5) were higher than in those without BE (0.4 +/- 0.3; P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> tended to have higher <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> stain scores (1.2 +/- 0.4) than patients who were not (0.7 +/- 0.3; P = 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> colony counts were similar in patients with BE compared to those without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, bacteria in esophageal biopsies were detected more often in BE than non-BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Increasing <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> stain scores were associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and increasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Esophageal bacteria, possibly related to stasis or gastric acid suppression therapy, may play a role in the pathogenesis of BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
