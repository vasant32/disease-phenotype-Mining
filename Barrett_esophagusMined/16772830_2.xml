<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the effect of low power (30 W) APC therapy on oesophageal motility in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with at least 4 cm of BE underwent oesophageal manometry before and after APC ablation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oesophageal body peristaltic wave duration and amplitude, and lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure and length were compared before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a total of 28 men and five women, with a mean age of 63.4 years (range 39-79) and mean BE length 6.5 cm (range 4-19), macroscopic clearance was achieved in 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A small statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) increase in peristaltic wave amplitude was seen after APC [mean (SD) mmHg before versus after: 30.4 (15.2) versus 36.2 (20.1) at 13.5 cm, 47.6 (27.1) versus 54.5 (26.8) at 8.5 cm, and 51.2 (35.3) versus 58 (34.4) at 3.5 cm above the LOS] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No changes in either peristaltic wave duration or LOS parameters [mean (SD) pressure 10.6 (5.6) versus 10.3 (4.3) mmHg; length 2.8 (1.3) versus 2.8 (1.0) cm] were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: APC ablation of BE at a power setting of 30 W does not impair oesophageal motility </plain></SENT>
