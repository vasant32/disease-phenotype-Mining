<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its importance stems from the poor five-year survival of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and current data that suggest a survival benefit when surveillance programs are implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review, we will cover the pathophysiology and natural history of BE and the different endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BE in different geographic areas and the incidence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in this patient population is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent recommendation for screening and surveillance of BE has been covered in this review as well as the efficacy of nonconventional imaging modalities and endoscopic ablation therapies </plain></SENT>
