<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS:: There is a growing trend toward the use of minimally invasive endoscopic methods to treat early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there is continuing controversy regarding the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and the value of surveillance programs continues to be debated, the ultimate goal is to eradicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the foci of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and hence the risk of developing an <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of ablative techniques have so far been applied, but none has yet been shown to be superior and entirely satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluates the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a promising new method of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in a sheep model, based on the use of a modified rigid esophagoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The resectoscope consists of a rigid esophagoscope with a distal transparent window through which the mucosa and part of the submucosa are sucked in and then resected with a wire loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sheep model was chosen because of its similarities to human <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> with regard to the thickness and histological structure of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five separate hemicircumferential resections and 11 circumferential resections were carried out in 21 and 11 animals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">Mitomycin C</z:chebi>, an agent inhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_180'>fibroblast proliferation</z:mpath>, was administered at different time intervals after eight circumferential resections to prevent the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the specimens of hemicircumferential resections were obtained as single distinct pieces and were easily examined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The surface of the specimen correlated with the size of the window and ranged from 6 to 12 cm (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In circumferential resections, the specimens were obtained in two pieces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An accurate resection depth through the submucosa was achieved in 58 of 65 resected specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred after hemicircumferential resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complications after circumferential resections (stenosis or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, or both) were minimized after appropriate timing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This EMR method offers a promising approach in comparison with other options currently available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It appears to be superior in terms of the size of the resected specimen, the precision and regularity of the resection depth, and the accuracy of histological diagnosis with safety margins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Hemicircumferential EMRs have been shown to be safe in the sheep model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This new technique warrants further animal studies before being used for circumferential EMR in humans </plain></SENT>
