<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Ablation of BE to squamous epithelium is achievable by combining a re-injury method with acid suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that, when there is complete ablation, the neo-squamous epithelium is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> histologically and in biomarker expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, squamous islands observed after prolonged use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> were associated with abnormalities in p53 expression and Ki-67 labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one nondysplastic BE cases with incomplete ablation were evaluated for the expression of Ki-67 (proliferation), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and p53 by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-ablation biopsies showed the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> staining patterns in columnar epithelium, ie, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Ki-67 labeling, rare positive COX-2 staining of interstitial cells, and negative or mild staining for p53 in the majority of patients' biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, post-ablation biopsies demonstrated abnormal staining patterns in the glandular area at the new squamocolumnar junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 13 of 21 post-ablation cases (62%), increased Ki-67 staining was seen in BE glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 8 of 21 patients (38%), increased COX-2 expression was seen in columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in 8 of 21 post-ablation junctions (38%), there was increased p53 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of increased expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated biomarkers in incompletely ablated BE patients raise a cautionary note regarding this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that newly formed junctions contain cells undergoing replication, differentiation, etc, and are thus more susceptible to genomic damage </plain></SENT>
