<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are over-expressed in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> making it possible for imaging with labelled SSTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A previous study showed feasibility to image <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> with SSTR analogue (99m)Tc-depreotide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(1) To investigate expression of the SSTRs in different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> and (2) to correlate such an expression with (99m)Tc-depreotide uptake in these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Material and Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total 28 patients (17 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> and 11 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) were examined with (99m)Tc-depreotide scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SSTR2A, SSTR2B, SSTR3, and SSTR5 were analyzed immunohistochemically in the lesion samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> 10/11 expressed different amounts of SSTRs, while SSTRs were absent in 5/6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>Squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (Sqcc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation neither between the (99m)Tc-depreotide uptake and the amount of SSTRs nor between the amount of SSTRs and differentiation grade of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(1) SSTRs are expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> and more abundantly so in adenocancer specimens; (2) in vivo (99m)Tc-depreotide uptake does not obviously correlate with the immunohistochemically detection of SSTRs of different subtypes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
