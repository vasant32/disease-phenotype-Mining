<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has important psychological and economic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although accepted standards for endoscopic biopsy methods and pathological interpretation for BE exist, adherence to these standards as a measure of the quality of care in BE has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the quality of care in BE by evaluating the process of care and adherence to accepted standards of practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Explicit process-of-care criteria were developed using a systematic literature review and expert opinion in four domains of care: the quality of biopsy methods, the adequacy in identifying endoscopic landmarks, endoscopist-pathologist communication, and pathological interpretation and reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> endoscopy and pathology reports of BE patients at two institutions from 1994-1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An academic medical center (N = 237) with staff endoscopists and an academically affiliated community hospital (N = 100) with private-practice endoscopists were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Physicians showed the highest adherence to accepted standards of care in the "adequacy of identifying landmarks" and "endoscopist-pathologist communication" domains, with a &gt; or =70% adherence rate in most criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, physicians demonstrated the poorest adherence with the "quality of biopsy methods" and "pathologist interpretation and reporting" domains, with adherence rates frequently &lt;60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly, biopsies were taken in the presence of visible <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> 35% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Performance on several of the quality indicators varied significantly by the practice setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have identified several opportunities for quality improvement efforts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In every domain, there is room for improvement, particularly in the quality of biopsy methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As initiatives to screen the large population of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> patients for BE may be imminent, the time is now to define the critical process-of-care measures to minimize the risk of overdiagnosis and inadequate endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
