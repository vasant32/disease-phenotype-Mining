<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study assessed the level of reflux symptoms, quality of life, drug consumption, and complications in patients at least 10 years after diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> at one centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred and fifty two patients with typical reflux symptoms and a first time diagnosis by endoscopy of grade I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> between 1981 and 1984, were followed up using a postal questionnaire and telephone interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen of 152 patients had died, 33 failed to respond, and 101 replied (mean follow up 11 years, range 121-160 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over 70% of patients still had heartburn at least daily (32%) or weekly (19%) or required daily acid suppression treatment (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients (2%) had developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014866" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophageal strictures</z:e> and one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of eight quality of life scores (physical function and social function) measured by the Short Form-36 were significantly lower than Northern Ireland population scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nearly three quarters of patients previously diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> still had significant morbidity related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> more than 10 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
