<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from population-based studies of BO incidence is limited, with equivocal results to date difficult to distinguish from changes in endoscopic practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess population trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) diagnoses in relation to endoscopy and biopsy rates over a 13 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Northern Ireland <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> Register (NIBR) is a population-based register of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9,329 adults diagnosed with columnar epithelium of the oesophagus in Northern Ireland between 1993 and 2005, of whom 58.3% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>European age-standardised annual BO incidence rates were calculated per 100,000 of the population, per 100 endoscopies and per 100 endoscopies including an oesophageal biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average annual BO incidence rates rose by 159% during the study period, increasing from 23.9/100,000 during 1993-1997 to 62.0/100,000 during 2002-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This elevation far exceeded corresponding increases in rates of endoscopies and oesophageal biopsies being conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BO incidence increased most markedly in individuals aged &lt; 60 years, and most notably amongst males aged &lt; 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study points towards a true increase in the incidence of BO which would appear to be most marked in young males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings have significant implications for future rates of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and surveillance programmes </plain></SENT>
