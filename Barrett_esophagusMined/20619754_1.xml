<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the gene expression of CDX2 and SHH and their signalling pathways in the columnar epithelium and the association with endoscopic appearance, gastric pH or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS/METHODS: Sixty-three patients with metaplastic columnar epithelium of the lower oesophagus were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole biopsy specimens and microdissected tissues were examined for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMP4 expression was significantly higher in patients with tubular mucosal patterns of columnar epithelium visualised by Narrow Band Imaging with magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of SHH was significantly lower and that of CDX2 was higher in the goblet columnar epithelium than in non-goblet columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CDX2 expression was significantly higher in the patients with hypoacidity than in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BMP4 and PTCH1 expression was significantly higher in the group with higher concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> than in the group with lower concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SHH might be the initial factor inducing columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, and subsequent or simultaneous BMP4 stimuli might induce the CDX2 expression that causes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet-cell metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
