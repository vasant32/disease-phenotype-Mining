<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether persistence of NDBE over multiple consecutive surveillance endoscopic examinations could be used in risk stratification of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a multicenter outcomes study of a large cohort of BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the number of consecutive surveillance endoscopies showing NDBE, we identified 5 groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in Group 1 were found to have NDBE at their first esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in group 2 were found to have NDBE in their first 2 consecutive EGDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, patients in groups 3, 4, and 5 were found to have NDBE in 3, 4, and 5 consecutive surveillance EGDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression model was built to determine whether persistence of NDBE independently protected against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of a total of 3515 BE patients, 1401 patients met the inclusion criteria (93.3% Caucasian, 87.5 % men, median age 60±17 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 5±3.9 y (7846 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The annual risks of EAC in groups 1-5 were 0.32%, 0.27%, 0.16%, 0.2%, and 0.11% respectively (P for trend=.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex, and BE length, persistence of NDBE, based on multiple surveillance endoscopies, was associated with a gradually lower likelihood for progression to EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Persistence of NDBE over several endoscopic examinations identifies patients who are at a low risk for development of EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings support lengthening surveillance intervals or discontinuing surveillance of patients with persistent NDBE </plain></SENT>
