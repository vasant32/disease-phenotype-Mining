<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such analyses are typically performed using fresh samples that require a separate or "jumbo" biopsy, are prone to false DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> if not promptly processed, and do not allow for retrospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of performing flow cytometric DNA analysis on paraffin-embedded biopsies was studied to circumvent some of these problems using 12 squamous esophageal mucosa with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and 58 BE cases showing varying degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the BE cases, 12 had no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 20 were indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 14 had low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 12 had high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory histograms were obtained in 86% of the analyzed samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among cases with adequate histograms, DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was identified in 77% with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 16% with low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 23% of indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 0% without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> samples was also DNA aneuploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlation of DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is highly significant (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors have demonstrated that routinely processed paraffin-embedded biopsies can be used for flow cytometric ploidy analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was highly correlated with degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and serves as a quantitative prognostic indicator for prospective as well as retrospective studies of the evolution of BE to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
