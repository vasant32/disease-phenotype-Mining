<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Her-2/neu is a protooncogene frequently overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, recently found to be also overexpressed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> arising on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are conventionally used for Her-2 testing in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, but a single assay is not yet accepted as a "gold standard" in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the correlation between histopathology variables and gene expression/amplification in the sequence BE-low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, fifty esophageal specimens from patients with a diagnosis of BE (21 BE, 4 low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 12 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 13 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic evaluation was carried out using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paraffin-embedded tissues were investigated for Her-2 by immunohistochemistry (HercepTest) and FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HercepTest was scored 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ depending on the percentage (cut off 10%) of membrane staining, whereas gene assessment evaluated by FISH was based on the ratio between Her-2/neu and the 17 chromosome copy number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between gene amplification and protein overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No case with HercepTest scoring 0 or 1+ displayed gene amplification, but this was present in 20% of cases scoring 2+ and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases scoring 3+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Her-2/neu amplification or overexpression was never observed in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gene amplification and overexpression was observed in more than 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Her-2/neu amplification/overexpression might be considered as a marker of progression from BE to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FISH may represent a useful diagnostic tool to integrate the result of HercepTest for selecting patients for more targeted therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
