<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective open randomized, parallel-group 62 patients of BE with a length of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> less than 3 cm in average age 72.8 +/- 2.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Method of "sealed envelopes" were divided into two equal groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients first--received <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> at a daily dose of 40 mg, the second--to combine the same dose of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> drug-Ursosan a daily dose of 10 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline and after 4.8+1.2 years assessed the frequency of esophageal, extraesophageal and dyspeptic complaints, endoscopic and morphological pattern of esophageal-gastric junction and lower third of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Confirm or exclude the diagnosis of BE during follow-up study was performed after a two-fold endoscopy upper GIT using subdivision techniques for sampling biopsy material and subsequent analysis of biopsy samples pathomorphology of various medical institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> and drug UDCA contributed to the positive dynamics is the lack of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in 32.3% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, whereas monotherapy with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> in a daily dose of 40 mg possible to achieve a similar result in 6.5% of patients (p = 0,01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of diagnosis of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> decreased after 5 years of therapy with 80.6% to 51.6% (p = 0.016) in the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> group and 86.7% to 16.7% (p &lt; 0.001) in the group receiving <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> and the preparation of UDCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests the possibility of combined therapy with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> and the preparation of UDCA (Ursosan) as a promising means for hemopreventciya <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
