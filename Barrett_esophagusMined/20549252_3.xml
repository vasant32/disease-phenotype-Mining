<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The anatomical reference points used to endoscopically diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) differ between Japan and other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The esophageal gastric junction (EGJ) is defined as the distal limit of the lower esophageal longitudinal or palisade vessels in Japan, but as the proximal margin of the gastric folds (Prague C&amp;M criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to prospectively compare endoscopic BE diagnoses using the Japanese and Prague C&amp;M criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two endoscopists examined 110 consecutive patients [73 male, 37 female; age, 66.5 ± 8.7 (mean ± standard deviation) years] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-gastrectomy, post-esophagectomy, and post-chemoradiotherapy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> patients were excluded as subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EGJ identification rates were 95% (104/110) and 86% (95/110) using the Japanese and Prague C&amp;M criteria, respectively (p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 110 patients, 43 (39%) and 29 (26%) were diagnosed as having endoscopic BE using the respective criteria (p = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> cases, there was no significant difference in EGJ identification rates between the Japanese and Prague C&amp;M criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the ratio of endoscopic BE diagnosis using the Japanese criteria was significantly higher than that using the Prague C&amp;M criteria in atrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> cases (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in endoscopic BE diagnostic results between the Japanese and Prague C&amp;M criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the Japanese population, the Japanese criteria may be more suitable for the definition of EGJ and for the diagnosis of endoscopic BE than the Prague C&amp;M criteria </plain></SENT>
