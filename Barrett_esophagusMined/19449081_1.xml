<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nucleostemin is a protein highly expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to explore the potential role of nucleostemin in the pathogenesis of BE METHODS: The expression profiles of 30,968 genes were compared between BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal tissues (n = 6 in each group) by using oligo microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three siRNA plasmid expression vectors against nucleostemin, pRNAi-1, pRNAi-2, and pRNAi-3, were constructed and transfected into HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, HT29 cells were exposed to 100-1,000 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16755">chenodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (CDC), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>, for 2, 12, and 24 h, and then <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions of nucleostemin and CDX2 were determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-six differentially expressed genes were detected in BE; 142 were upregulated and 284 downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nucleostemin was downregulated while CDX2 was upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the recombinant plasmids inhibited the nucleostemin expression in transfected HT29 cells, with pRNAi-1 being the most effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CDX2 expression was significantly increased in pRNAi-1-transfected HT29 cells, compared with that in the empty plasmid (pRNAT-U6.1/Neo) transfected or untransfected HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, CDX2 expression was increased whereas nucleostemin expression was decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HT29 cells treated with CDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the inhibition of nucleostemin expression in "esophageal stem cells" in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> exposure may be involved in the pathogenesis of BE through upregulating CDX2 expression </plain></SENT>
