<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Narrow-band imaging (NBI), one of the most recent techniques, involves the use of interference filters to illuminate the target in narrowed red, green and blue (R/G/B) bands of the spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This results in different images at distinct levels of the mucosa and increases the contrast between the epithelial surface and the subjacent vascular network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NBI can be combined with magnifying endoscopy with an optical zoom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this new technique is to characterize the surface of the distinct types of gastrointestinal epithelia - e. g., <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technique may also make it possible to demonstrate disorganization of the vascular pattern in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> of the gastrointestinal mucosa and in superficial neoplastic lesions in the esophagus, stomach, and large bowel </plain></SENT>
