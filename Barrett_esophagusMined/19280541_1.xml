<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have significantly higher levels of DGER than patients with uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical response to conventional high-dose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy in patients with uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and DGER is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 30 patients with uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and combined pathological reflux (acid and bile) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical work-up included evaluation of clinical symptoms, esophageal manometry and upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 6 - 8 weeks of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7915">Pantoprazole</z:chebi> 80 mg/d pH measurement and Bilitec 2000 were repeated, and the pattern of symptoms was re-evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7915">Pantoprazole</z:chebi> 80 mg/d <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> was normalised in 28 patients (93 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly the mean percentage of DGER (time with an absorption greater than 0.14) was significantly reduced from 19.6 % (+/- 13.7) to 5.7 % (+/- 7.7, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients (50 %) an elevated DGER persisted under treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7915">Pantoprazole</z:chebi> (DGER-NR group) whereas in 15 cases (50 %) a normalisation could be achieved (DGER-R group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The DGER-NR group had significantly higher levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> before (and under) treatment compared to the DGER-R group: 22.9 % (9.98 %) vs. 15.6 % (0.72 %), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, the median quality of life index (QLI) improved from 4.78 (+/- 0.86) before to 8.04 +/- 1.84) under therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical response under treatment was marikedly reduced in the DGER-NR group compared to the DGER-R group: QLI 7.3 vs. 8.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Particularly heartburn and nocturnal coughing persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7915">pantoprazole</z:chebi> therapy effectively exerts acid suppression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients with combined pathological reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, DGER could only normalised in 50 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>High levels of DGER at diagnosis enhance the risk of persistent DGER under <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy and are associated with a reduced clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
