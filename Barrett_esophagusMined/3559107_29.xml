<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had sensitivity to esophageal acid perfusion less frequently than those with uncomplicated reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (66 vs. 100%; p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with acid sensitivity took longer to develop pain during acid perfusion (p less than 0.05), and overall, experienced less severe symptoms (p less than 0.01) than those with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over a 2-week period, as judged by diary, the Barrett's group had less frequent (p less than 0.01) and less severe (p less than 0.01) heartburn symptoms than the other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have significantly reduced esophageal acid sensitivity and, as a consequence, have an impaired ability to recognize <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
