<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven (50%) had recurred reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in association with various disorders of motility: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014863" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal spasm</z:e> in 4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> in 3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> in 2, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002032'>esophageal atresia</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight (36%) had primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014863" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal spasm</z:e> and 3 (14%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005240'>Esophageal obstruction</z:hpo>, regurgitation, and severe spasm were the most common manifestations of the inability to swallow normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic or transhiatal (blunt) esophagectomies were performed in 5 and 17 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stomach, with a cervical esophagogastric anastomosis, was used for esophageal substitution in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients underwent a long-segment colonic interposition, and 1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> underwent a distal esophagectomy and short-segment colonic interposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> died from unrecognized intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> into the opposite chest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no other operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional complications included transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarseness</z:hpo> in 8 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo> in 1, and anastomotic leak in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After an average follow-up of 25 months for the 21 surviving patients, ability to eat is regarded as good in 18 (85%), fair in 1 (5%), and poor in 2 (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with incapacitating esophageal neuromotor disease, a more radical operative approach-esophagectomy--may be safer and more reliable than attempting another procedure and risking another failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy ensures definitive elimination of the esophageal problem and as optimal an ability to eat as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that the stomach, with a cervical esophagogastric anastomosis, offers a better functional esophageal substitute than does a colonic interposition </plain></SENT>
