<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Helical microwave antennas have been developed for ablative treatment of Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A microwave balloon applicator was tested in an initial animal study using adult white pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For treatment, a balloon filled with tissue-equivalent material encapsulated the antenna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A range of different treatment temperatures and durations was used to investigate a range of thermal ablations of the oesophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight animals were investigated, five non-survival and three with a 1-week survival period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The balloon was fitted with an array of temperature sensors, which gave an indication of the treatment in situ and allowed modifications to be performed in real time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Temperature data were recorded from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four quadrants of the balloon throughout and test sites were collected and analysed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> experiments were successfully completed without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, serious adverse effects or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sites of discrete ulceration were induced in the survival tests, whereas the non-survival tests yielded little reproducible tissue modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results suggested that an activation temperature of approximately 55 degrees C needed to be reached during the treatment for tissue damage to be induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Once damage had been triggered the severity was related to the mean temperature attained during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A mean temperature of 52 degrees C or more resulted in substantial damage, whilst a mean temperature of approximately 50 degrees C resulted in the desired surface damage with sparing of subjacent tissues </plain></SENT>
