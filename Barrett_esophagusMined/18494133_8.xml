Previous work has demonstrated comparable specimen diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the two techniques have not been previously compared with respect to depth of resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a database of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, we identified 40 consecutive specimens removed using EMR from patients with HGD or IMCA, 20 each from the "inject, suck, and cut" and the "band and snare" techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens were evaluated and measured separately by two pathologists for greatest diameter and depth, and for the presence of submucosa and muscularis propria at the deepest margin of resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were collected regarding clinical outcome and stricture formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean depth of the specimens from the two techniques was not significantly different (0.51 cm vs. 0.50 cm, P = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> specimens contained substantial submucosa, allowing accurate staging of the neoplastic lesions resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Muscularis propria was identified at the base of 65% of the "band and snare" and 50% of the "inject, suck, and cut" specimens (P = 0.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The "inject, suck, and cut" and "band and snare" techniques both yield equivalent adequate depth of histological specimens from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with HGD or IMCA, and both provide accurate pathological staging </plain></SENT>
