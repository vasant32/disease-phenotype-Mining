<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients may have difficulty understanding this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the perceived risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in patients with BE, and correlated their risk estimates with their health care use behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a survey of patients with BE participating in an endoscopic surveillance program at 2 sites: a university teaching hospital and a Veterans' Administration hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire also elicited their demographics as well as their sources of health information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Health care behaviors, including physician visits and endoscopic surveillance behaviors, were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as either overestimators or nonoverestimators of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of overestimators, as well as health care use patterns, were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred eighteen patients met entry criteria, and 92 (78%) completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight percent of patients overestimated their 1-year risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, with a mean estimated 1-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk being 13.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lifetime risk also was overestimated by 38% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who overestimated risk were more likely to be Veterans' Administration medical center patients, have more symptomatic reflux, and were more likely to use the Internet to get health care information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in physician visits between overestimators and nonestimators (1.2 visits per year vs 1.0, P = .20), nor in endoscopy use (5.7 endoscopies per 5-year period vs 5.0, P = .42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with prevalent BE participating in an endoscopic surveillance program overestimated their chances of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Efforts to improve education of such patients with BE are warranted </plain></SENT>
