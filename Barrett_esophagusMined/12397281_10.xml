<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This prospective study examined the appropriate use of EGD in an open-access system with the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines and determined whether the ASGE guidelines were associated with relevant endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a cohort of 1777 consecutive patients referred for open-access EGD, the proportion of patients who underwent EGD for appropriate indications was prospectively assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between appropriateness and the presence of clinically relevant endoscopic diagnoses was assessed by calculating (1) the likelihood ratio, positive and negative, of the indications; and (2) the change in the probability of relevant endoscopic diagnoses in the presence of the ASGE criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate for EGDs "generally not indicated" was 15.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relevant endoscopic diagnoses were present in 47.4% of cases with ASGE indications versus 28.8% of patients without appropriate indications as defined by the ASGE criteria (OR: 2.23; 99% CI [1.55, 3.22]; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar difference was observed for erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (OR: 1.86; 99% CI [1.17, 2.95]; p &lt; 0.01), erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (OR: 1.48; 99% CI [0.87, 2.52]; p &lt; 0.05), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (OR: 9.76; 99% CI [0.72, 132]; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pretest probability of finding a relevant endoscopic diagnosis was modified slightly when an ASGE indication(s) was present and decreased markedly when ASGE criteria were absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of the ASGE guideline for appropriate indications for EGD can improve patient selection for the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, to avoid missed diagnoses of serious disease, use of the guidelines must be tailored to the specific clinical setting </plain></SENT>
