<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) in Luoyang, China, has not been reported, and its pathogenesis is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the prevalence of BE and its underlying factors in the city of Luoyang </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This was a prospective study in one center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many patients were analyzed using endoscopy who showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal symptoms</z:e> between August 2006 and June 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effect of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins and heat shock proteins upon BE's pathogenesis were also investigated by an immunohistochemical protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of BE was at 4.55% and the mean age of those affected was about 10 years older than for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Typical reflux symptoms were significantly lower than with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, whereas signs of caspase-3 and HSP105 elevation were significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of TERT, HSP70 and HSP90Î± in BE cases was significantly lower than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups in expression of HSP27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of BE is high in Luoyang, which could result from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> despite typical reflux symptoms being relatively uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initiation and development of BE might be the result of accelerated proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and differentiation of original cells to intestinal epithelium </plain></SENT>
