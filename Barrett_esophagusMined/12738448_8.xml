<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have been reported in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of patients with long-segment BE (LSBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate and compare the frequency of LOH on 9p and 17p in patients with long- and short-segment BE (SSBE) without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and blood DNA were evaluated for LOH on chromosomes 9p and 17p in patients with a previous diagnosis of BE and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 18 patients (12 long-segment BE and six short-segment BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of LOH was 61% (10 of 18), with no significant difference between LSBE (58%) and SSBE (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of LOH on 9p and 17p were similar (35% and 39%, respectively), with 18% of the patients showing losses at both chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LOH on 9p and 17p are highly frequent events in BE, even in the absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of these abnormalities in non-neoplastic epithelium suggests they might be useful markers for risk stratification within endoscopic surveillance programs </plain></SENT>
