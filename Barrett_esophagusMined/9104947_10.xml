<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adult patients having elective upper gastrointestinal endoscopy over a 6-month period were invited to participate in a prospective study whose aim was to determine the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the distal esophagus in an adult population with diverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal symptoms</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data and endoscopic findings were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brush cytology and biopsy specimens were obtained from both sides of the apparent squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cytology specimens were processed routinely, stained with the Papanicolaou technique, and reviewed blinded to the clinical information and the histological findings in the corresponding biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty-five patients (81 women, 74 men; 137 whites, 11 blacks, 7 others; mean age, 52 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glandular epithelium/cells were present on both histology and cytology in 147 specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients (22%) showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> on histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the cytology specimens from these 32 patients, 6 contained definite goblet cells (19%), 7 probable goblet cells, and 19 no goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Goblet cells and probable goblet cells were observed on cytology in 7 and 11 additional specimens, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One was from a patient known to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up endoscopy with biopsy was performed in two of these latter 18 patients and did not show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
