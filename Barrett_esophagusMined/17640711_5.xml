<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has demonstrated a rapid increase in incidence over the last 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This increase mirrors a dramatic rise in that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, which is associated with esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in at least 95% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to understand the pathogenesis of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, attention has turned to the antiapoptotic and oncogenic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrated that Akt was frequently activated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>-related <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, the levels of Akt activation were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After institutional review board ethics approval, 60 archival tissue specimens of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising on a background of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> were selected for immunohistochemical staining with phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The slides were scored by 2 independent observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 80% of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cases demonstrated strong to moderate Akt activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two percent of Barrett mucosa revealed low Akt activity, the remaining cases being p-Akt negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> cases exhibited strong p-Akt staining, whereas only weak p-Akt activity is seen in a portion of metaplastic Barrett mucosa, Akt is highly activated in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a role of p-Akt in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and provide the rationale for using p-Akt inhibitor API-2/triciribine, which is currently in clinical trial, in the treatment of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
