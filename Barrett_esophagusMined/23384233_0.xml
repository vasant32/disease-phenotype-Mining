<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It had been observed that some patients had esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> (EE) infiltration after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence and features of EE after RFA were systematically determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From a prospectively compiled database, data on 148 patients who underwent RFA for BE were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were taken pre- and post-RFA from the BE segment, and histological sections of the biopsy specimens were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, and examined by a gastrointestinal pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of EE post-RFA was then determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 148 patients, 120 (81%) were men, 137 (92%) were white, 64 (43%) were overweight and 49 (33%) <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, and 128 (86%) were over 50 years of age or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four (2.7%) of the patients developed post-RFA EE, but none had symptoms of eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients except one had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018621" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">seasonal allergies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four were taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> before and after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients with EE drank alcohol, one of which was a smoker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EE is a potential adverse event of RFA for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The absence of esophageal dysfunction symptoms suggests a different clinicopathological entity from eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies should be done to assess its clinical significance, if therapy is needed, or if it may eventually lead to eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
