<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has been recognized for over 50 years, the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to the replacement of squamous esophageal epithelium with a columnar type are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Barrett's is known to be an acquired process secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and occurs in the presence of severe disruption of the gastroesophageal barrier and reflux of a mixture of gastric and duodenal content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current hypothesis suggest that epithelial change occurs due to stimulation of esophageal stem cells present in the basal layers of the epithelium or submucosal glands, toward a columnar epithelial differentiation pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transcription factor CDX2 seems to play a key role in promoting the cellular biology necessary for columnar differentiation, and can be induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> and acid stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several cellular signaling pathways responsible for modulation of intestinal differentiation have also been identified and include WNT, Notch, BMP, Sonic HH and TGFB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These also have been shown to respond to stimulation by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi>, acid or both and may influence CDX2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their relative activity within the stem cell population is almost certainly responsible for the development of the esophageal columnar epithelial phenotype we know as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
