<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and related <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> are important in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267055" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erosive oesophagitis</z:e> (EO) and its malignant progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) on oesophageal cellular immune response and oxidative damage in EO patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) patients [non-erosive reflux disease (NERD): 15, EO: 25] were included, after 7 days off antisuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EO patients were randomized to 20-mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> once daily for either 4 or 8 weeks with baseline and follow-up endoscopy with distal oesophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T lymphocytes, macrophages and mast cells were quantified by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA adducts were measured by analysis of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267055" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Erosive oesophagitis</z:e> patients had more T lymphocytes and CD8(+) T lymphocytes in squamous epithelium than NERD patients (P = 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of DNA adducts between both groups were, however, not different (P = 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four- and eight-week <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> treatment in EO patients resulted in a significant decrease in number of T lymphocytes and CD8(+) T lymphocytes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> did not, however, affect levels of DNA adducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short-term <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy in EO patients reduces the oesophageal cellular immune response, but does not change oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy may therefore not be effective in reducing the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
