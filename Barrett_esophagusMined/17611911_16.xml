<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Surveillance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> relies on the detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the natural history of this condition, particularly that of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper describes our experience of LGD over a period of 21 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1984 and January 1995, 357 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were recruited for annual surveillance: 34 of these patients developed LGD during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was a retrospective cohort study of this group in terms of survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> outcomes &gt;/= 8 years after the original diagnosis of LGD, comparing them with the patients who did not develop LGD over the same period, with a histopathological review of the original diagnoses of LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of 356/357 (99.7 %) of the patients were established in December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 8 years, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> had developed in 9/34 patients with LGD (27 %) and in 16/322 controls (5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox's proportional hazards model revealed that the time from the first diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to the first "event" of either HGD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> did not show a statistically significant difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A further analysis treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as "loss to follow-up" showed a significantly increased risk for the LGD group to progress to HGD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (hazard ratio 5.9 [95 % confidence interval 2.6 - 13.4], P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The histopathology review demonstrated a fair level of agreement between pathologists, with a kappa value of 0.48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with LGD during surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are at a considerably increased risk of progressing to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> over an 8-year period but most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> are not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related </plain></SENT>
