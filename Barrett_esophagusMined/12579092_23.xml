<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression levels, relative to the control gene encoding beta-actin, were measured by using a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method (ABI 7700 Sequence Detector system) in specimens of Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (n = 16), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 11), <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = l 5), and matching <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophageal tissues (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor protein expression and CD31(+) microvessel density were assessed by means of immunohistochemistry in 25 tissue sections that included representative areas for each of these Barrett stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression levels were significantly increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> compared with in either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa (P &lt;.0001 for both genes) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (vascular endothelial growth factor, P =.002; basic fibroblast growth factor, P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor levels were also significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> tissues (P =.024, Mann-Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basic fibroblast growth factor expression was also significantly increased in Barrett dysplastic mucosa compared with in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microvessel density was generally higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> compared with in preneoplastic Barrett tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pattern of vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor protein expression was similar to the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression pattern, with the exception that mucin-containing goblet cells stained intensely for vascular endothelial growth factor and only weak vascular endothelial growth factor staining was present in some <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression levels are significantly upregulated in esophageal and gastroesophageal junction <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, suggesting a role for these angiogenic factors in the development of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression levels are also increased in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> tissues, with this increase occurring at an earlier stage for basic fibroblast growth factor than for vascular endothelial growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Basic fibroblast growth factor protein expression pattern is similar to the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression pattern, but unlike the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> findings, vascular endothelial growth factor protein expression is strongest in goblet cells </plain></SENT>
