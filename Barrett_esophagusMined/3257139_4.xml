<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A blinded, retrospective study was performed to determine the role of double-contrast esophagography in diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 200 patients who had double-contrast esophagrams and endoscopy because of severe reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The radiographs were reviewed by two gastrointestinal radiologists who had no knowledge of the endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as being at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> if the radiographs revealed a high stricture or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> or a reticular mucosal pattern; at moderate risk if the radiographs revealed a distal peptic stricture and/or reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>; and at low risk if none of the aforementioned findings were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When these radiologic criteria were used, 10 patients (5%) were thought to be at high risk, 73 (37%) at moderate risk, and 117 (58%) at low risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic correlation revealed biopsy-proved Barrett's mucosa in nine (90%) of 10 patients at high risk, in 12 (16%) of 73 at moderate risk, and in only one (1%) of 117 at low risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, endoscopy is clearly indicated for patients in the high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the lower prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in the moderate-risk group, clinical judgment should be used in deciding when to perform endoscopy in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, most patients were in the low-risk group, and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was so low in this group that endoscopy does not appear to be warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the major value of double-contrast esophagography is its ability to separate patients into high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to determine the relative need for endoscopy and biopsy </plain></SENT>
