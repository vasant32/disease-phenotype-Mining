<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are conflicting reports regarding its effect on the development of nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the prevalence and axial length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> in patients with NERD, compared with patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Axial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> length of the diaphragmatic hiatus was measured prospectively at endoscopy in controls and patients with typical reflux symptoms occurring at least weekly during the last month relieved by antacids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A final diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> was established in 21.2% of 249 controls, 60.4% of 346 patients with NERD, 78.1% of 251 patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and 88.2% of 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients aged &gt;59 years were most likely to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an increased prevalence in patients with NERD as compared with controls (P&lt;0.0001), and decreased prevalence as compared with those with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.0001 and 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Axial length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> &gt;3 cm was found more frequently in patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> as compared with patients with NERD (P&lt;0.0001 and 0.0052, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical significant difference between controls and patients with NERD regarding the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> &gt;3 cm (P=0.0904) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A small (&lt;3 cm) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> may contribute to the development of NERD, whereas an axial length &gt;3 cm is associated with a more severe disease </plain></SENT>
