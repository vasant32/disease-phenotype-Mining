<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, findings in such transformed cells may not be applicable to the non-neoplastic cells of benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have developed and characterized a Barrett's cell line derived from a patient without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human Barrett's epithelial cells were immortalized with the insertion of hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) using a Cre-lox recombination system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then examined properties of this continuous cell line, such as in vitro tumorigenicity, growth patterns, histological differentiation characteristics, karyotype, and checkpoint arrest mechanisms (e.g., p16, p21, and p53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-neoplastic Barrett's epithelial cells infected with hTERT (BAR-T cells) have been sustained in culture beyond 200 population doublings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BAR-T cells maintain a diploid chromosome number and exhibit non-neoplastic properties, such as contact inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BAR-T cells express differentiation Barrett's epithelial markers, such as villin and cytokeratins 4, 8 and 18, and stain positive for Alcian blue, indicating the presence of mucin-producing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of checkpoint arrest proteins p21 and p53 are intact, while p16 expression is lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have created a human Barrett's cell line that is not malignantly transformed, and yet can be maintained indefinitely in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BAR-T cells are diploid, have histological differentiation markers characteristic of benign Barrett's epithelium, and also maintain appropriate expression of p21 and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This cell line should be a useful model for the study of the early events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
