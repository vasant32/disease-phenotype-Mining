<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy specimens from 23 patients were examined for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi> expression of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9/10, and CYP2E1 by immunohistochemical analysis, and the expression of CYP1A1, CYP3A4, CYP1B1, CYP2E1, and CYP2C9/10 in these tissues was further confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of esophageal squamous mucosa (n = 12) showed expression of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2E1, and CYP2C9/10 proteins, but it was noted that cells within the basal proliferative zone did not express <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYPs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 13) showed expression of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2E1, and CYP2C9/10 that was prominent in the basal glandular regions, which are areas containing a high percentage of actively proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for both proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYPs</z:chebi> further supported the colocalization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi> expression to areas of active cell proliferation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, whereas in the esophageal squamous epithelium, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi> expression is limited to cells that are not proliferating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR with amplification product sequence analysis confirmed CYP1A1, CYP3A4, CYP1B1, CYP2E1, and CYP2C9/10 mRNA expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the potential ability of cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to both activate carcinogens and proliferate may be important risk factors affecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_605'>metaplastic tissue</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
