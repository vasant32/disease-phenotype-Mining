<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNA/miR) are one such class of biomolecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present cross-sectional study, we characterized miRNA alterations in progressive stages of neoplastic development, i.e., <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, with an aim to identify candidate miRNAs potentially associated with progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using next generation sequencing (NGS) as an agnostic discovery platform, followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) validation in a total of 20 EACs, we identified 26 miRNAs that are highly and frequently deregulated in EACs (â‰¥ 4-fold in &gt;50% of cases) when compared to paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous (nSQ) tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then assessed the 26 EAC-derived miRNAs in laser microdissected biopsy pairs of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM)/nSQ (n = 15), and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD)/nSQ (n = 14) by qPCR, to map the timing of deregulation during progression from BM to HGD and to EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that 23 of the 26 candidate miRNAs were deregulated at the earliest step, BM, and therefore noninformative as molecular markers of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two miRNAs, miR-31 and -31*, however, showed frequent downregulation only in HGD and EAC cases suggesting association with transition from BM to HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A third miRNA, miR-375, showed marked downregulation exclusively in EACs and in none of the BM or HGD lesions, suggesting its association with progression to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we propose miR-31 and -375 as novel candidate microRNAs specifically associated with early- and late-stage malignant progression, respectively, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
