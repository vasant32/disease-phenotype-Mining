<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates endoscopic fluorescence detection in patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and compares the results to those of standard endoscopy with random four-quadrant biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 30 examinations in 28 patients (22 men, 6 women; age range 37-78 years, mean age 60 years,), with five patients having known intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A dose of 20 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">5-aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> was given orally 5 hours before examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Random four-quadrant biopsies were performed 4-6 weeks before endoscopic fluorescence detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the biopsies taken during the endoscopic fluorescence detection procedure, 28 % (23/81) were true positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More than one-third of the false-positive results were due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the 97 control biopsies taken on nonfluorescing areas during endoscopic fluorescence detection were dysplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic fluorescence detection showed low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in five patients which was not diagnosed with random four-quadrant biopsies, while random four-quadrant biopsies alone showed three low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> that were invisible during endoscopic fluorescence detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (2/2) were detected with both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence detection achieved a similar performance when compared with four-quadrant random biopsy, but resulted in fewer biopsies (81 for endoscopic fluorescence detection vs 531 for random four-quadrant biopsies) </plain></SENT>
