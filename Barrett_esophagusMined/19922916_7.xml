<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to demonstrate large-area SECM in upper GI tissues and to determine whether the images contain microstructural information that is useful for pathologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A feasibility study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Gastrointestinal Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Fifty biopsy samples from 36 patients undergoing routine EGD were imaged by SECM, in their entirety, immediately after their removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The microstructure seen in the SECM images was similar to that seen by histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gastric cardia mucosa was clearly differentiated from squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gastric fundic/body type mucosa showed more tightly packed glands than gastric cardia mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fundic gland <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> showed cystically dilated glands lined with cuboidal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of intraepithelial eosinophils was detected with the cells demonstrating a characteristic bilobed nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was identified by columnar epithelium and the presence of goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was differentiated from specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> by the loss of nuclear polarity and disorganized glandular architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Ex vivo, descriptive study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Large-area SECM images of gastroesophageal biopsy samples enabled the visualization of both subcellular and architectural features of various upper GI mucosal types and were similar to the corresponding histopathologic slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the development of an endoscopic SECM probe is merited </plain></SENT>
