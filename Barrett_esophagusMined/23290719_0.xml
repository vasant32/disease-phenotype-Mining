<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The safety, efficacy, and durability of radiofrequency ablation (RFA), with or without EMR, have been established for long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (LSBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ablating ultralong-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (ULSBE) may be associated with increased stricture formation, eradication failure, and treatment session requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to compare eradication and stricture rates between LSBE (≥3 to &lt;8 cm) and ULSBE (≥8 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our secondary objective was to evaluate treatment durability and session requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospectively collected data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary care facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 72 patients (34 ULSBE, 38 LSBE; mean Barrett's segment length of 10.8 and 4.7 cm) underwent RFA between August 2005 and September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 45 and 34 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Eradication and complication rates for ULSBE and LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eradication rates for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (90% vs 88%, P = 1.0) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) (77% vs 82%, P = .77) were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ULSBE patients required more overall (P &lt; .01) and circumferential (P &lt; .01) RFA; however, stricture rates were identical (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> recurrence, and IM recurrence was similar (ULSBE, 23%; LSBE, 16%; P = .52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 3 years, IM remained eradicated in 65% of ULSBE and 82% of LSBE, without maintenance RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On multivariate regression analysis, increasing Barrett's length was associated with a reduced likelihood for eradicating IM (odds ratio 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75-1.00), but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (odds ratio 1.13; 95% CI, 0.95-1.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ULSBE can be treated in its entirety at each session with efficacy and safety comparable to LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>ULSBE requires more effort to achieve IM eradication, and RFA is less durable in maintaining this eradication at 3-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
