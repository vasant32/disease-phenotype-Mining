<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In previous studies, the length of the glandulo-metaplastic esophageal mucosa (GMEM) at the gastroesophageal junction was assessed in a selected group of baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the length of the GMEM was measured in the entire esophagus in a cohort of unselected adult baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 15 female baboons, the entire esophagus was removed en bloc at autopsy, from the tongue to the angle of His </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No part of the stomach was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The length of GMEM was measured using a calibrated ocular microscale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GMEM was found in 11 out of the 15 esophagi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total length of GMEM recorded in the 11 cases was 115 mm (mean 10.5 mm, range 1-45 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age for animals with GMEM was 15.5 years (range 7-32 years) and for animals without GMEM was 14.0 years (range 7-20 years); the difference was non-significant (p&lt;0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found between the length of the GMEM and the age of the animals (p&lt;0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study substantiates the notion that GMEM in baboons is a postnatal physiological adaptative process of the esophageal mucosa to daily regurgitation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0232604" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">rumination</z:e> of gastric juices of low pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The GMEM apparently progresses upwards, along the esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The baboon might be an excellent animal model to study the series of histological events that take place in the distal esophagus under the influence of protracted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
