<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The yield of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) with randomly obtained biopsy specimens in patients with short lengths of columnar-appearing mucosa in the distal esophagus is low (30%-50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vital staining would be beneficial if it identified more patients with short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the confirmation of IM in patients with suspected SSBE (columnar-appearing mucosa &lt;3 cm in length) by using <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> (MB)-directed versus random biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing EGD in whom columnar-appearing mucosa less than 3 cm in length was visualized underwent MB staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stained areas within suspected SSBE segments were targeted for biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biopsy specimens were stained with H &amp; E with alcian blue at pH 2.5 and evaluated by a single pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A historical control group (different from patients undergoing MB staining) consisted of patients with less than 3 cm of columnar-appearing mucosa in whom biopsy specimens were obtained randomly without MB staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MB group included 75 patients (mean age 63.8 +/- 10.9 years) with a mean length of columnar-appearing mucosa of 1.2 cm (range 0.5-2.5 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The control group included 83 patients (mean age 60.5 +/- 12.9 years) with a mean length of columnar-appearing mucosa of 1.16 cm (range 0.5-2.5 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IM (i.e., confirmed SSBE) was detected in 61% of the MB group versus 42% of the control group (p = 0.0237) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients in the MB group required significantly fewer biopsies (4.3 +/- 1.5 vs. 5.1 +/- 12.3, p = 0.0162) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of IM by length was as follows: less than 1 cm (irregular Z line), MB 17.4% versus control 25% (p = 0.73); 1 to less than 2 cm, MB 77% versus control 45% (p = 0.03); 2 to less than 3 cm, MB 90% versus control 58% (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MB chromoendoscopy significantly increases the detection of IM and requires fewer biopsies in patients with suspected SSBE with greater than 1 cm of columnar-appearing mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It does not appear to be beneficial in patients with irregular Z lines (&lt;1 cm) </plain></SENT>
