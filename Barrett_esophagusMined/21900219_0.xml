<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may progress to low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), or even EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> progresses to EAC at a rate of 0.5% per year, rates of progression for true LGD and HGD are significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment is mandatory for HGD and may be appropriate in select patients with nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and many with LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, accurate pathologic assessment is necessary before considering endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previously, only esophagectomy was offered to patients with HGD or EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, esophagectomy has significant morbidity and mortality, and therefore endoscopic therapies have been advocated for early Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These methods include endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and ablative techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ablation techniques include <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation, multipolar electrocoagulation, laser therapy, photodynamic therapy, radiofrequency ablation, and cryotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, radiofrequency ablation has experienced the greatest adoption for the treatment of dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> because of excellent published outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of EMR to resect suspicious areas or raised lesions is mandatory to provide histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ablation techniques such as radiofrequency ablation have been shown to effectively eradicate large areas of dysplastic tissue with relative ease but do not allow for histologic assessment of the treated area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Combination EMR with radiofrequency ablation is thus advocated to resect visible lesions via EMR (providing histology) and ablate the remainder of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As always, the appropriate treatment is best determined after careful discussion with patients in a multidisciplinary environment </plain></SENT>
