<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine cases of surgically resected <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the gastric cardia and 23 cases of resected <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arising in Barrett's columnar lined lower esophagus were compared histologically and clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, the two groups were almost identical in terms of pattern of growth (expansile or infiltrative), degree of differentiation, and extent of spread at the time of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These similarities are not surprising, as the two <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> arise close to each other from almost identical mucosas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major histologic difference was the finding of much more frequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the adjacent Barrett's mucosa than in the surrounding cardiac mucosa, probably a reflection of the larger surface area covered by Barrett's than by cardiac mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The groups differed in certain epidemiologic parameters that possibly reflected independent carcinogenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, although the age ranges and median ages were the same, there was a higher male predisposition among the patients with cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> had a significantly higher history of heavy smoking and history of alcohol intake, whereas those with Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were much more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
