<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This requires a thorough understanding of the risk factor for its development, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article summarizes the most up-to-date and important advancements involving the epidemiology, screening, pathogenesis, surveillance, and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> over the past year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Much of the literature over the past year involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> centered on selecting subsets of patients who would benefit most from screening and surveillance protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors such as increasing age, heartburn symptoms, increasing length of Barrett's segment, and male sex are increasingly identified as increasing the risk for malignant esophageal transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New technologies, using smaller endoscopes, may allow more cost-effective screening in selected patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">Methylene blue</z:chebi> continues to grow in acceptance for its utility in assisting identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> during endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some concern has been raised recently about DNA damage secondary to the use of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi>, but the clinical significance of this is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-magnification endoscopy to identify certain mucosal patterns suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> is also gaining acceptance, perhaps allowing more accurate surveillance in patients with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Much controversy continues regarding the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> to prevent the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data reports may show some advantage of surgical antireflux therapy in reducing the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, but a recent meta-analysis disputes this claim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor dysfunction continue to be revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The past year has brought many new advances involving the diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is important for physicians to be aware of these developments, to identify individuals in whom interventions may be undertaken to decrease the risk of the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
