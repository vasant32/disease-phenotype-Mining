<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagogastric and having a malignant potential junction can be considered as an ultra-short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the epidemiologic and histological features of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of esophagogastric junction two groups of patients were compared for the prevalence of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1 included 82 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> symptoms et group 2 consisted of 82 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups had two biopsy specimens taken from the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was defined as specialized columnar epithelium containing goblet cells staining with alcian blue at pH 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagogastric junction was present in 12 patients in group 1 and 9 individuals in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The global prevalence of this condition was 12.8% and there was not a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of this condition between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant difference could not be found when sex was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between this condition and older age (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagogastric junction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> do not have the same epidemiologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that screening biopsy specimens of the esophagogastric junction be limited to study protocols at this time </plain></SENT>
