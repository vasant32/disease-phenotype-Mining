<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, patients with BE are subjected to a systematic endoscopic surveillance to detect initial evolution towards non-invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (NiN) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, that eventually occurs only in a small fraction of BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate the possible role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase-omega 1 (GSTO1), a recently discovered member of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase family, as a progression marker in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's disease</z:e> in order to improve the diagnosis of NiN in BE and to understand the mechanisms of the progression from BE to AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the expression and subcellular localization of GSTO1 in biopsies from patients with BE and in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines subjected to heath shock treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A selective nuclear localisation of GSTO1 was found in 16/16 biopsies with low- or high-grade NiN, while it appeared in only 4/22 BE biopsies without signs of NiN (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among biopsies of BE without NiN, diffuse (nuclear and cytoplasmic) staining was found in 5/22 cases, while selective cytoplasmic localisation was found in 13/22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 6 cases with indefinite grade of NiN were equally divided between nuclear, cytoplasmic and diffuse staining (2 each, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experiments in vitro showed that in human HeLa <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, GSTO1 translocates into the nucleus as a consequence of heath shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that the nuclear translocation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase-omega 1 could be involved in the stress response of human cells playing a role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its immunohistochemical detection could represent a useful tool in the grading of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
