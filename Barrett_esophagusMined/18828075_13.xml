<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: We have recently proposed a classification of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> based on three criteria: regularity of mucosal pattern, regularity of vascular pattern, and presence of abnormal blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the interobserver agreement with the proposed mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> classification and to assess the additional value of narrow band imaging (NBI) over high resolution white light endoscopy (HR-WLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five international experts in the field of Barrett's imaging and seven community endoscopists with no expertise in this field independently evaluated magnified still images from 50 areas, obtained with HR-WLE and NBI, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual analogue scales (VAS) were used for scoring imaging quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement for mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and yield for identifying early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Imaging qualities of NBI were rated more highly than HR-WLE, when evaluated separately as well as in a side-by-side comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interobserver agreement ranged from 0.40 to 0.56 and did not significantly differ between expert and non-expert endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall yield for correctly identifying images of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was 81 % for HR-WLE, 72 % for NBI and 83 % for HR-WLE + NBI, with no significant difference between experts and non-experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Interobserver agreement for the classification of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although NBI was rated more highly than HR-WLE for imaging quality, this did not result in improved interobserver agreement or increased yield for identifying early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This applied to non-expert as well as expert endoscopists </plain></SENT>
