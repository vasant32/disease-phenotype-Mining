<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present three cases of squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus in Barrett patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients were white men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None had a history of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> or of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had substantial usage of alcoholic beverages and tobacco </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were located in squamous-lined mucosa above the Barrett mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath> was present in the Barrett mucosa of two of our patients, and the third patient had a squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the pharynx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> represented 2% of Barrett-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> at our institution in 1980 through 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five additional cases were found in the literature, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were also in white men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This demographic predominance stood in striking contrast to the 26% prevalence of white patients among those with squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus at our institution (P less than 0.0002) and to the 50% prevalence of white men among our patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (P less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of the literature cases also had substantial alcohol and tobacco usage and had synchronous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in Barrett mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings of a strikingly high prevalence of white men and of multifocal neoplastic changes in the upper aerodigestive tract suggest a pathogenetic relationship between squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, possibly due to alcoholic beverage and tobacco usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic surveillance of Barrett patients for early detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has been recommended; contemporaneous evaluation of the squamous-lined esophagus by biopsy and cytopathology may be advisable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
