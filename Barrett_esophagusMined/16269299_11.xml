<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Survivin, a member of the inhibitor-of-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> family, is reported to be overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> but no data are available about its status in the metaplastic/dysplastic sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to measure survivin gene expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous/columnar epithelium and in the various stages of development of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic biopsy or operative specimen samples from 5 tissue types were analyzed: (1) squamous epithelium from 3 cm above the gastroesophageal junction in patients with a negative pH study and no histologic injury (n = 17, pH- control); (2) antral tissue from patients with no evidence of Barrett's, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (n = 29, antral control); (3) specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 16; Barrett's group); (4) low- or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 12, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> group), and (5) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 45 cancer group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After laser-capture microdissection cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from each tissue and reverse transcribed to complementary DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of survivin were measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survivin gene expression was greater in columnar (antral) compared with squamous (pH-) control tissues (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression in quiescent Barrett's epithelium was similar to both control tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression levels in dysplastic epithelium were greater than in squamous control (P = .01) and Barrett's tissues (P = .04), but not higher than columnar control tissues, whereas expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was greater than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues except <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Survivin expression may be a biomarker in the development of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> that is able to distinguish between quiescent Barrett's, dysplastic Barrett's, and Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
