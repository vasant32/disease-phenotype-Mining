<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, long segment as well as short segment, has increased over the last few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One major reason for this was the increasing number of endoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However there is a simultaneous increase of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the Western world, while the number of squamous epithelium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides improved endoscopic diagnosis other exogenous factors such as nutrition, reflux or adipositas play an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to available data it is clear that the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has been overestimated, mainly because of a publication bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> has been published with 0.5%/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The U.S. and German guidelines do not recommend screening endoscopies for the general population, however for those with a long-lasting reflux disease for several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is made endoscopically and histologically, this means 4 quadrant biopsies every 1-2 cm are gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Staining with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> in combination with zoom endoscopy may improve the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> regular surveillance endoscopies depending on the presence of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> are recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and no or with low grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> need only surveillance, those with high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> should be treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EMR is a promising treatment of visible lesions, which is similar effective as surgery but with a lower morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Non visible lesions can be treated promisingly by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similar to high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> can also be treated endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> needs surgery </plain></SENT>
