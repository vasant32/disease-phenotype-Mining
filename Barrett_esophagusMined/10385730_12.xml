<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A simple and safe method for controlled ablation of esophageal mucosa is not currently available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an endoscopic cryotherapy device was developed and its efficacy and safety were assessed in a swine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The device consists of a cryogenic system that delivers cold nitrogen gas via a catheter introduced into the esophagus through the accessory channel of an upper GI endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Esophagoscopy was performed in 20 swine under conscious sedation, and cold nitrogen gas was sprayed on the distal 2 to 3 cm of the esophagus under direct visualization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Freezing of the esophageal mucosa was evidenced by the appearance of a white "cryoburn" with sharply demarcated margins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemicircumferential to circumferential freezing of the distal esophagus was achieved in 20 swine by varying the duration of cryoburn from 10 to 60 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mucosal ablation was noted 2 to 7 days after treatment in 95% of the swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications included 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal strictures</z:hpo> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cryotherapy performed by spraying liquid nitrogen at upper GI endoscopy is a simple technique capable of inducing controlled superficial mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with complete healing in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This method warrants further evaluation as a treatment for esophageal lesions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
