<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Doppler optical coherence tomography (DOCT) is an imaging modality that allows assessment of the microvascular response during photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) and may be a powerful tool for treatment monitoring/optimization in conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the technical feasibility of catheter-based intraluminal DOCT for monitoring the microvascular response during endoluminal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in an animal model of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Thirteen female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent esophagojejunostomy to induce enteroesophageal reflux for 35 to 42 weeks and the formation of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 9 received <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> by using the photosensitizer Photofrin (12.5 mg/kg intravenous), followed by 635-nm intraluminal light irradiation 24 hours after drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 4 surgical rats underwent light irradiation without Photofrin (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another group of 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats, without esophagojejunostomy, also received <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DOCT imaging of the esophagus by using a catheter-based probe (1.3-mm diameter) was performed before, during, and after light irradiation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Distinct microstructural differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus, BE, and the transition zone between the 2 tissues were observed on DOCT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar submucosal microcirculatory effects (47%-73% vascular shutdown) were observed during <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus and surgically induced BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Controls displayed no significant microvascular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No apparent difference was observed in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>-induced vascular response between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat esophagus and the BE rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Real-time monitoring of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>-induced vascular changes by DOCT may be beneficial in optimizing <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> dosimetry in patients undergoing this therapy for BE and other conditions </plain></SENT>
