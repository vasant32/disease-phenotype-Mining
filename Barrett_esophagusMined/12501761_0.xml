<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> of the Service of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Allergy</z:e> and Immunology at the Hospital Regional Lic </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: It was made an observational study from July 2000 to July 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gastroesophageal gammagraphic and endoscopy (with taking of esophageal biopsy) were carried out to each of the patients in order to find out if there was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 112 patients with moderate persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> (54 women and 58 men) were included and divided in three different age groups (group I, from 1 to 5 years old; group II, from 6 to 10 and III, from 11 to 16 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> was 138, 100 and 93, respectively, being specially high in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in the prevalence among different groups were statistically significant between group I and II (p &lt; 0.001) and between I and III (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant changes were not observed between group II and III (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> the structured was high, situation directly related with the diagnostic suspicion in our asthmatic population </plain></SENT>
