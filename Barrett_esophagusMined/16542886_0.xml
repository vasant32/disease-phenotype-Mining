<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the usefulness of a modified crystal violet chromoendoscopy procedure and utilised a new pit pattern classification for diagnosis of dysplastic Barrett's lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1,030 patients suspected of having a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e> were examined, of whom 816 demonstrated a crystal violet-stained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The early group of patients underwent 0.05% crystal violet chromoendoscopy, while the later group was examined using 0.03% crystal violet with 3.0% <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A targeted biopsy of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined oesophagus</z:e> was performed using crystal violet staining after making a diagnosis of closed or open type pit pattern with a newly proposed system of classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between type of pit pattern and histologically identified dysplastic Barrett's lesions was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dysplastic Barrett's lesions were identified in biopsy samples with an open type pit pattern with a sensitivity of 96.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, Barrett's mucosa with the intestinal predominant mucin phenotype was closely associated with the open type pit pattern (sensitivity 81.9%, specificity 95.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The new pit pattern classification for diagnosis of Barrett's mucosa was found to be useful for identification of cases with dysplastic lesions and possible malignant potential using a crystal violet chromoendoscopic procedure </plain></SENT>
