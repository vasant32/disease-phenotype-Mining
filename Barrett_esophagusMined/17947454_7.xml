<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanism(s) of NOX5-S overexpression in EA, however, is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SEG1 EA cells we found that acid treatment significantly increased platelet-activating factor (PAF) production, which in turn markedly increased NOX5-S expression and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of NOX5-S by NOX5-S small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) blocked PAF-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PAF-dependent induction of NOX5-S expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production were significantly decreased by the MAPK kinase 1 inhibitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059, by the cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2341">AACOCF3</z:chebi>, and by STAT5 downregulation with STAT5 siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PAF significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK, cPLA(2), and STAT5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using inhibitors, we demonstrated that PAF-induced STAT5 phosphorylation depends on activation of ERK1/2 MAPK and cPLA(2), whereas PAF-induced cPLA(2) phosphorylation was associated with activation of ERK1/2 MAPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given that STAT5 bound to the c-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="30585">sis</z:chebi>-inducible element (TTCTGGTAA) of the NOX5-S promoter, overexpression of STAT5 significantly increased NOX5-S promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that acid-induced NOX5-S expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production is mediated in part by production of PAF in SEG1 EA cells, and that PAF-induced increase in NOX5-S expression depends on sequential activation of ERK MAP kinases, cPLA(2), and STAT5 in these cells </plain></SENT>
