<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In BE, the stratified epithelium is replaced by an intestinal-type epithelium owing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> gastroduodenal reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since self-renewal of intestinal crypts is driven by Notch signaling, we investigated whether this pathway was active in the proliferative crypts of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of an intact and activated Notch signaling pathway in metaplastic BE epithelium, but not in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar observations were made in two well-known human Barrett's-derived EAC cell lines, OE33 and SKGT-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then sought to investigate the effects of Notch inhibition by systemic treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor in a well-validated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As we have shown previously in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal epithelium, Notch inhibition converted the proliferative Barrett's epithelial cells into terminally differentiated goblet cells, whereas the squamous epithelium remained intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data imply that local application of gamma-secretase inhibitors may present a simple therapeutic strategy for this increasingly common pre-malignant condition </plain></SENT>
