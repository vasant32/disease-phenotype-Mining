<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> in BE, or from the gastroesophageal junction region, develop within mucosa devoid of goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the biologic properties, pathogenesis, and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of metaplastic, esophageal nongoblet columnar epithelium, is, essentially, unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, 89 patients with metaplastic esophageal columnar epithelium were evaluated immunohistochemically for markers of intestinal differentiation, such as MUC2, DAS-1, Villin, and CDX2, a marker of gastric differentiation (MUC5AC), and Ki67, a marker of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 89 patients, 59 had columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> with goblet cells (BE), which were further separated into low-density goblet cell and high-density goblet cell groups based on the percentage of crypts with goblet cells, and 30 patients had columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus without goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As controls, gastric biopsies from 19 age and sex matched patients without esophageal or gastric pathology were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of positivity of the markers and the location of Ki67 staining was evaluated only in non-goblet columnar epithelium from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with metaplastic esophageal columnar epithelium without goblet cells showed positivity for MUC5AC, MUC2, DAS-1, Villin, and CDX2 in 100%, 0%, 30%, 17%, and 43% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>17% of cases showed aberrant surface Ki67 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These values were significantly higher than gastric controls, which showed absence of staining for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers except MUC5AC (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with metaplastic esophageal columnar epithelium with goblet cells (BE) a significant increased rate of staining was observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers, except MUC5AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, both MUC2 and surface Ki67 staining were significantly increased in BE patients with high-density goblet cells versus those with low-density goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In a separate analysis in which metaplastic esophageal nongoblet epithelium was evaluated in areas of mucosa devoid of goblet cells compared with areas of mucosa with goblet cells, from patients who had goblet cells elsewhere in the mucosa (N=59), no significant differences were observed with regard to the percentage of cases that stained with any of the markers in the nongoblet epithelium in areas devoid of goblet cells, similar to the patient group with metaplastic esophageal epithelium without goblet cells (N=30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similar to above, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, expression of intestinal markers increased in areas of mucosa adjacent to goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence that metaplastic esophageal columnar epithelium without goblet cells shows phenotypic evidence of intestinal differentiation and supports the theory that squamous epithelium converts initially to nongoblet columnar epithelium before <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate the pathogenetic sequence, natural history, and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of metaplastic esophageal nongoblet epithelium </plain></SENT>
