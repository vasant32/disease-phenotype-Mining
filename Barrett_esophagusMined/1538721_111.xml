<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Conventional medical treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> involves life-style modifications and combination drug therapy, but few studies have included these features in their protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antireflux surgery has seldom been studied prospectively, and there have been no trials comparing modern medical and surgical treatments for reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a long-term, randomized trial of medical therapy (lifestyle modifications and up to four medications) and surgical therapy (Nissen fundoplication) in 247 patients (243 men and 4 women) with peptic <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcer</z:mp>, stricture, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They received by random assignment either continuous medical therapy, medical therapy for symptoms only, or surgical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were assessed quarterly with a disease-activity index; esophagoscopy was performed at base line and each year for two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcomes evaluated at one and two years included the activity index, and the endoscopic grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up data were available for 176 patients at one year and for 106 patients at two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- SE) activity-index score (possible range, 74 to 172) decreased in one year from 108 +/- 3 to 87 +/- 2 in the group receiving continuous medical therapy, from 107 +/- 3 to 88 +/- 2 in the group receiving medical therapy for symptoms only, and from 109 +/- 3 to 78 +/- 2 in the surgical-therapy group (P less than 0.0001 for the change from base line, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- SE) grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (possible range, 1 to 4) decreased in the respective groups from 2.9 +/- 0.1 to 2.0 +/- 0.1, from 2.9 +/- 0.1 to 2.3 +/- 0.1, and from 2.9 +/- 0.1 to 1.4 +/- 0.1 (P less than 0.005 vs. base line, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean activity-index score and the grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were significantly better in the surgical-therapy group than in either medical-therapy group during the two years of follow-up (P less than 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In men with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, surgery is significantly more effective than medical therapy in improving the symptoms and endoscopic signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> for up to two years, although medical treatment is also effective </plain></SENT>
