<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that the human erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter (Glut1) is expressed in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have also shown that Glut1 is expressed as a late event during colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to determine the chronology of Glut1 expression during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 251 biopsies from 97 patients with BM were immunostained with the anti-Glut1 antibody MYM, after microwave-aided antigen retrieval, using the standard avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> complex immunoperoxidase technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was graded as negative (ND), low grade (LGD)/indefinite or high grade (HGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the 181 biopsies with ND (0%) or 51 biopsies with LGD (0%) showed Glut1 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More importantly, although 0 of 6 biopsies with HGD (0%) expressed Glut1, 9 of 13 biopsies with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (69%) were Glut1 positive (P = 0.0108, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that Glut1 is expressed as a late event during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of Glut1 immunoreactivity as a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in patients with BM </plain></SENT>
