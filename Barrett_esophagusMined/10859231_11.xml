<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi>, with or without acid, on cell proliferation in BE and assessed mechanism(s) involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To mimic physiological conditions, biopsies of esophagus, BE, and duodenum were exposed to a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> mixture, either continuously or as a 1-h pulse, and were compared with control media without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> (pH 7.4) for &lt; or =24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar experiments were also performed with acidified media (pH 3.5) combined with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> mixture as a 1-h pulse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was assessed by a [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation assay with or without bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), a selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37700">protein kinase C inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">Bile salt</z:chebi> pulses enhanced cell proliferation in BE without affecting cell proliferation in esophageal or duodenal epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of BIM, there was complete obliteration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi>-induced BE hyperproliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 1-h pulses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> in combination with acid significantly inhibited proliferation in BE but had no effect on esophagus or duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in BE explants, brief exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi>, in the absence of acid, increases proliferation, whereas exposure to a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi> and acid together inhibits proliferation </plain></SENT>
