<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite an excellent gastrointestinal (GI) safety profile of coxibs, their use is limited because of the possible cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The coupling of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> with a NO-donating moiety has led to the birth of a new class of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, called the COX-inhibiting nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17891">donators</z:chebi> (CINODs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The member of this group, NO-aspirin (NO-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) retains the anti-inflammatory properties of traditional aspirin (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>), but the release of NO accounts for anti-thromboembolic effect and better GI safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of NO-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in the prevention of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BA) has not been studied so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of the present study was: 1) to analyse the expression of COX-2 in the biopsies obtained from BE; 2) to compare the effect of NO-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> with that of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> on proliferation rate in Barrett''s <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line (OE-33 cells); 3) to determine the effect of both compounds on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate using FACS analysis and expression of 32-kDa procaspase-3 and active proapoptotic 20-kDa caspase-3 in OE-33 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of COX-2 was assessed in biopsies obtained from the Barrett's mucosa and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelial esophageal mucosa from 20 BE patients by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BA cell line (OE-33) was incubated with NO-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (10-1000 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate was measured by BrdU and FACS-analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of caspase-3 (active and inactive form) was analyzed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's mucosa a significant up-regulation of COX-2 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with traditional <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, NO-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> caused a significantly stronger induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (dose-dependently) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of cell proliferation in OE-33 cells observed under NO-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> treatment was due to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The increase in apoptotic rate was accompanied by the upregulation of active 20-kDa caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At the highest concentration (1000 microM), a necrotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of OE-33 cells was observed under NO-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We conclude that: NO-<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> caused induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in BA cell line and slight growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that this compound may represent a promising chemopreventive agent for Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
