<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unsedated transnasal esophagoscopy may provide an efficient and accurate endoscopic assessment with fewer risks and less cost, compared with conventional upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and yield of unsedated transnasal esophagoscopy in a primary care population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Two outpatient tertiary-care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved a general medical clinic population aged between 40 and 85 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Unsedated, office-based transnasal esophagoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Procedure yield; completeness of examination; procedure length; adverse events and complications; <z:mp ids='MP_0003298'>choking</z:mp>, gagging, pain, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> during the examination; and overall tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 426 participants (mean [± standard deviation] age 55.8 ± 9.5 years; 43% male) enrolled in the study, and 422 (99%) completed the examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean (± standard deviation) examination time was 3.7 ± 1.8 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no serious adverse events, and 12 participants (2.8%) reported minor complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Participants reported minimal <z:mp ids='MP_0003298'>choking</z:mp>, gagging, pain, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The examination was well-tolerated by most participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, 38% of participants had an esophageal finding that changed management (34% erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 4% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Nonrandomized study, tertiary-care centers only, self-selected population with a large proportion reporting esophageal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Unsedated transnasal esophagoscopy is a feasible, safe, and well-tolerated method to screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> in a primary care population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings are common in this patient population </plain></SENT>
