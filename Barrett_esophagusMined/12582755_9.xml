<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Barrett's esopagus (BE) is considered a risk factor for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, partial restoration of squamous mucosa after ablation of BE with endoscopic techniques has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From November 1996 to November 1999, 23 patients with histologically proven BE have been treated by endoscopic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) following suppression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-esophageal reflux</z:e> by laparoscopic fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological follow-up after completed ablation ranged from 16 to 45 months (mean, 31.9 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histologically, complete squamous reepithelialization was observed in 20/23 patients, whereas a regrowth of a mixed squamous and gastric type mucosa was observed in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small islands of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were observed under the neosquamous epithelium in two patients (9%) during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The success rate of APC ablation following laparoscopic antireflux surgery in our series may be as high as 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, small islands of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> under the new squamous epithelium may persist in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these circumstances, the authors recommend that endoscopic ablation of BE should be confined to controlled clinical trials </plain></SENT>
