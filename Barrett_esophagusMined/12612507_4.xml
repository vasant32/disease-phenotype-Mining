<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A cost-effective technique is needed for screening of a broad population at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A solution would be to have non-physician endoscopists perform esophagoscopy with small-caliber battery-powered endoscopes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective blinded study, the diagnostic accuracy of sedated esophagoscopy performed by a trained nurse practitioner with a battery-powered 4-mm diameter endoscope was compared with that for a sedated standard video-endoscopy performed by a gastroenterologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were recruited to undergo peroral esophagoscopy by the nurse practitioner followed by sedated standard endoscopy by the supervising gastroenterologist, each blinded to the findings of the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major esophageal findings of nurse practitioner and gastroenterologist were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Findings in 40 patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients both endoscopists could not assess the presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> because of severe erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n = 3) or severe candida-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By using sedated standard endoscopy as the standard, on a per finding basis, esophagoscopy by the nurse practitioner had a sensitivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> of 89%: 95% CI [75%, 97%] and specificity of 96%: 95% CI [84%, 99%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The missed columnar epithelium was a 3 x 3-mm island </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions, the sensitivity of endoscopy performed by the nurse practitioner with the battery-powered endoscope was 75%: 95% CI [67%, 82%] and specificity 98%: 95% CI [96%, 99%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The nurse practitioner missed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of 4 rings (3 considered clinically irrelevant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Esophagoscopy with a battery-powered 4-mm diameter endoscope by a non-physician endoscopist is feasible and accurate in detecting esophageal pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may be an efficient screening method for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was a distinct underestimate of the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267081" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal rings</z:e> </plain></SENT>
