<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Neoplastic progression</z:e> of BE towards EAC is associated with increased expression of COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased COX-2 expression and enzyme activity is linked to the COX-2 CA haplotype, which consists of two gene polymorphisms in the COX-2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the impact of COX-2 haplotypes on the risk of developing EAC in patients with different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> including BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA was obtained from a total of 635 Dutch white patients comprised of 140 patients with EAC, 255 with BE, and 240 with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>COX-2 haplotypes were based on the gene polymorphisms at -765C/G and -1195A/G, as determined by PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The tested population contained 170 (14%) CA- (-765C and -1195A) haplotypes, 829 (65%) GA and 271 (21%) GG-haplotypes, and no GC-haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The haplotype distribution in patients with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and BE was similar (CA 12%, GA 68%, GG 21%), but differed significantly from that in patients with EAC (CA 21%, GA 58%, GG 20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Particularly, the CA-haplotype was more common (P &lt; 0.001) in EAC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CA-carriership was associated with EAC (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-6.2, P= 0.008), with homozygosity for the CA-allele being statistically most significantly associated (OR 6.1, 95% CI 1.6-24.2, P= 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The COX-2 CA-haplotype is more frequently observed in patients with EAC than in patients with BE and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a direct link between COX-2 activity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in patients with BE and reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
