<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To gain more insight into current surveillance and treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> with the aim of developing new guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In 2004, a questionnaire was sent to 337 physician-endoscopists who were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> registered with the Netherlands Society of Gastroenterology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire inventoried various aspects of surveillance and treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 289 respondents (86%), 96% carried out surveillance or had it carried out, on at least a proportion of their patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 258 respondents (89%) carried out the surveillance themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An endoscopic indication of the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was, for 31% of the respondents, enough reason to carry out surveillance of this condition irrespective of the results of pathological investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>75% applied an age limit for surveillance for Barrett's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median age limit is 75 years (interquartile distance: 70-75) and 46% of the treating professionals limited themselves to patients who, on the basis of age and co-morbidity, may undergo oesophageal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The choice of treatment in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, surgical or endoscopic, depends not only on the histological diagnosis, but also on the age and the co-morbidities of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surveillance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is widespread in the Netherlands, and in general is carried out in accordance with international guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The possibilities of treating patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus endoscopically, and of consulting external advisory bodies are still insufficiently utilized </plain></SENT>
