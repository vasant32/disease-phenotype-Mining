<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic screening in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) to rule out high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio as outcome measure, the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic screening was compared to not screening in a decision tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was assumed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients at age 60 yr undergo a one-time endoscopy with esophageal biopsies, targeting abnormal-appearing epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive biopsies with respect to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> result in esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transition rates were estimated from U.S. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> statistics, as well as published data of endoscopic sensitivity, specificity, and surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Costs of screening and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care were estimated from Medicare reimbursement data from the perspective of a third-party-payor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with no screening, screening endoscopy cost $24,700 per life-year saved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness of screening is quite sensitive to the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, as well as the sensitivity, specificity, and cost of screening endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A small drop in the health-related quality of life associated with postsurgical states markedly reduced the effectiveness of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous variations of the prevalence, specificity, and health-related quality of life can easily change screening endoscopy from a life-saving into a life-losing strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Under favorable conditions, general screening by endoscopy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with reflux symptoms to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> may represent a cost-effective strategy; however, such conditions may be difficult to meet </plain></SENT>
