<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The pattern of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> type has been changing for some time in a number of countries, with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> becoming more frequent OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of columnar-lined (Barrett's) oesophagus and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> during a 20-year period in a single centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and histology reports for the period January 1977 to December 1996 inclusive were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed from patients who had histologically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data were analysed as a single cohort and in five-year bands according to the date of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 44,721 endoscopies, 636 Barrett's oesophagus cases were diagnosed; 508 (323 males 185 females; M:F ratio 1.7) were histologically proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> detection increased steadily from 0.2% to 1.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> endoscopies per five-year band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The M:F ratio and the mean ages at diagnosis (61 years, range 60-63 for males and 69 years, range 68-79 for females) remained constant throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was diagnosed at a younger age in males (peak 60-69 years) compared to females (peak 70-79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The male oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> incidence (11.1%) was almost twice that in females (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the majority (81%), the initial diagnosis of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was made concurrently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> frequency may reflect an increasing incidence or recognition of this condition or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> males are more likely to develop oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> than females </plain></SENT>
