<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the associations among <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, fruit and vegetable intake, and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), a potential precursor to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a case-control study within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident BE cases (N = 296) were matched to persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> controls N = 308) and to population controls (N = 309) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nutrient intake was measured using a validated 110-item food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> results were stratified by dietary versus total intake of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparing cases to population controls, dietary intake of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> were inversely associated with the risk of BE (4th vs 1st quartile, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26-0.90; OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.99, respectively), and the inverse association was strongest for vitamin E (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11-0.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inverse trends for <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> index (total and dietary) and fruit and vegetable intake were statistically significant, while most total intakes were not associated with reduced risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> supplements did not influence the risk of BE, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> and fruits and vegetables were inversely associated with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dietary <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, fruits, and vegetables are inversely associated with the risk of BE, while no association was observed for supplement intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that fruits and vegetables themselves or associated undetected confounders may influence early events in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
