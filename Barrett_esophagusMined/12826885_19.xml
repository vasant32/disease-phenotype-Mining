<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study consists of 959 consecutive patients in whom endoscopic biopsies were taken according to a protocol that permitted mapping and measurement of epithelial types in the gastroesophageal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The epithelial types were classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (oxyntic and squamous) and questionably abnormal (oxyntocardiac, cardiac, intestinal) by strict histologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into four groups based on the length of histologically defined abnormal glandular epithelium in the measured biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 811 (84.6%) patients had 0 to 0.9 cm of questionably abnormal columnar epithelium between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oxyntic mucosa and squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 161 (19.9%) patients had no abnormal epithelium, 158 (19.4%) patients had oxyntocardiac mucosa, 372 (45.9%) patients had cardiac mucosa, and 120 (14.8%) patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 148 (15.4%) patients had &gt;or=1 cm of abnormal columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient in this group had cardiac or intestinal epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of intestinal epithelium increased progressively with increasing length of abnormal columnar epithelium, being present in 70.4% in the 1- to 2-cm group, 89.5% in the 3- to 4-cm group, and 100% with in the &gt;or=5 cm group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose a histologic grading system of biopsies based on these findings </plain></SENT>
