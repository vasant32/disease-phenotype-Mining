<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has been estimated at about 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This estimate is based primarily on data concerning the prevalence of that association in series of hospitalized patients and autopsies--a practice that tends to exaggerate the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed retrospectively our experience with 115 patients whom we treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> between September 1962 and March 1983, and have distinguished our data on the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> from that on incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For 8 patients, we found both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> during the initial evaluations for a prevalence ratio of 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We followed 105 patients not found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> initially for a total of 350 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 2 patients developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> during that follow-up period for an incidence of 1 case per 175 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This incidence, although some 40-fold greater than that of the general population, is substantially lower than previously estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Routine endoscopic and histologic surveillance has been recommended for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> because of the alleged high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inasmuch as that incidence now appears to be low, we question the value of such surveillance for these patients </plain></SENT>
