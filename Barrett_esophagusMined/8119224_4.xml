<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients affected by histologically confirmed BE had multiple biopsies taken from the metaplastic epithelium and one biopsy taken from the gastric fundus, as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The samples were either stored at -80 degrees C or immediately measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nuclei suspensions were obtained, stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi>, measured with a high resolution flow cytometer (ICP22A, Ortho Instruments) and analyzed for the evaluation of the relative DNA content and the S- and G2 + M phases of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA histograms having two distinct G0/G1 peaks were classified as DNA aneuploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (DNA Index, DI), defined as the ratio of abnormal to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA content, was obtained from the mixture of each BE sample with its control sample and trout erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found six patients with DNA aneuploid populations (14.6%), whose DNA Index values were 1.05 (in two), 1.8 (in one), and 2.0 (in three cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA ploidy did not correlate with age and sex of the patients, length, histologic type, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 13 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (6 indefinite, 4 low grade and 2 high grade with intramucous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) only two (one indefinite and one low grade) showed DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (15.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that the S-phase and the G2 + M-phase fractions in BE samples were both significantly higher than those of the controls (respectively, p = 0.01 and p = 0.0008).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
