<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: We aimed to estimate the proportion of significant endoscopic findings and their association with dyspeptic symptoms and to evaluate the predictors for significant endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Total of 3,872 subjects (58.3% men, mean age 43.6Â±9.3 years) who had undergone endoscopy were enrolled at the health promotion center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each subject completed validated questionnaires, including data on gastrointestinal symptoms, socio-demographic history and medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant endoscopic findings were included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease, reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and gastro-duodenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the predictors for significant endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of significant endoscopic findings was 39.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference of endoscopic findings between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> and asymptomatic group (41.0% vs. 37.4%, p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference of the incidence of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> between subjects with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>Peptic ulcer</z:hpo> was more frequently present in subjects with reflux symptoms than asymptomatic subjects (12.3% vs. 9.0%, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male gender (odds ratio [OR], 3.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.18-4.81) increased the risk for having endoscopic abnormality and having symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">functional dyspepsia</z:e> according to Rome III criteria (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-0.97) significantly decreased this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: About 40% of subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> had abnormal endoscopic findings, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> symptoms may not predict the significant endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">functional dyspepsia</z:e> by Rome III may be useful to predict not having significant upper endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
