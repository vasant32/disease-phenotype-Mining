<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In view of the increasing incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and the mortality and high morbidity rates associated with surgical therapy for this condition, safe and effective but less invasive methods of treatment are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of endoscopic resection in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Single-center prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Teaching hospital, conducted between October 1996 and September 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 100 consecutive patients (mean age, 62.1 +/- 10.9 years; range, 31-86 years) with low-risk <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus (macroscopic types I, IIa, IIb, and IIc; lesion diameter up to 20 mm; mucosal lesion without invasion into lymph vessels and veins; and histologic grades G1 and G2) arising in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Endoscopic resection with the suck-and-cut technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Complete local remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 144 resections (1.47 per patient) were performed without technical problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No major complications and only 11 minor ones (<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> without decrease of Hb &gt;2 g/dL; treated with injection therapy) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete local remission was achieved in 99 of the 100 patients after 1.9 months (range, 1-18 months) and a maximum of 3 resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 36.7 months, recurrent or metachronous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were found in 11% of the patients, but successful repeat treatment with endoscopic resection was possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The calculated 5-year survival rate was 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Nonblinded, nonrandomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic resection is associated with favorable outcomes for low-risk patients with early esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
