<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 35 cases, Campylobacter-like organisms (CLOs) were found in both cytology and biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 15 cases, CLOs were seen in biopsy material only, and in 8 cases, CLOs were found in cytology material only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLOs were found in 49% of the gastric specimens and 33% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> specimens by histologic or cytologic examination or by both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLOs were found by at least one method in 64% of the gastric samples with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> 40% with borderline <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, 15% without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, and in 64% with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
