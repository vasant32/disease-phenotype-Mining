<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a high incidence of stenosis: 28 (80%) children presented with stenosis of the esophagus from mild to severe degree and 20 of them (70%) developed shortened or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This data suggest that in our serie the diagnosis of GER has been delayed or medical therapy has been inadequate or excessively prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surgical treatment of GER with or without stenosis is the Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our first cases of shortened esophagus were treated by intrathoracic Nissen fundoplication, which was considered an extensive and major risk surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lately, for these cases we have been utilizing the gastro-fundoplication without opening of the chest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is an easier surgery, through which we could reach good results without serious postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
