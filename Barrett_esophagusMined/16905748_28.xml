<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show here that the secondary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (DCA), is the only one of the commonly refluxed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> tested here, to show genotoxicity, in terms of chromosome damage and mutation induction in the human p53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This genotoxicity was apparent at both neutral and acidic pH, whilst there was a considerable increase in bile-induced toxicity at acidic pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The higher levels of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and low cell survival rates at acidic pH may imply that acid bile exposure is toxic rather than carcinogenic, as dead cells do not seed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also show that DCA (at neutral and acid pH) induced the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the cytoplasm of exposed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate that the genotoxicity of DCA is ROS mediated, as micronucleus induction was significantly reduced when cells were treated with DCA + the anti-oxidant <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we show that DCA, is an effective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50902">genotoxin</z:chebi> at both neutral and acidic pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> like DCA can induce DNA damage at neutral pH, suppressing the acidity of the refluxate will not completely remove its carcinogenic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The genotoxicity of DCA is however, ROS dependent, hence anti-oxidant supplementation, in addition to acid suppression may block DCA driven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in Barrett's patients </plain></SENT>
