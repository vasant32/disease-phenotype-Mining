<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The low yield and high cost of endoscopic screening of patients with BE underscores the need for novel biomarkers, such as microRNA (miRNA), which have emerged as important players in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> for risk assessment of developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported highly elevated levels of miRNA-196a (miR-196a) in EA and demonstrated its growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluated miR-196a as a marker of BE progression to low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and EA using microdissected paraffin-embedded tissues from 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of miR-196a were observed in EA, BE, and dysplastic lesions compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous mucosa, and in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> compared with BE and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using frozen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues from 10 additional patients who had advanced EA, we evaluated the correlation of miR-196a with its in silico-predicted targets, keratin 5 (KRT5), small proline-rich protein 2C (SPRR2C), and S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), which are down-regulated during BE progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MiR-196a levels inversely correlated with the predicted target <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that miR-196a specifically targets KRT5, SPRR2C, and S100A9 3' UTRs using miR-196a-mimic and luciferase reporter-based assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study identified miR-196a as a potential marker of progression of BE and KRT5, SPRR2C, and S100A9 as its targets </plain></SENT>
