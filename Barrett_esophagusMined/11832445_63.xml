<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: To explore mechanisms whereby <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> might contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) we studied: (1) the effects of acid on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, cell proliferation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line (SEG-1); and (2) the ability of acid to activate the MAPK pathways in vivo in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SEG-1 cells were exposed to acidic media for 3 minutes, and the activities of 3 MAPKs (ERK, p38, and JNK) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proliferation was assessed using flow cytometry; cell growth and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were assessed using cell counts and an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> ELISA assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAPK activation was studied in biopsy specimens taken from patients with BE before and after esophageal perfusion for 3 minutes with 0.1N HCl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Acid-exposed SEG-1 cells exhibited a significant increase in proliferation and total cell numbers, and a significant decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects were preceded by a rapid increase in the activities of ERK and p38, and a delayed increase in JNK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> 98059 abolished the acid-induced increase in G0/G1 and decrease in subG0 phases of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both SB 203580 and DN-JNK 1/2 inhibited the acid-induced progression from G0/G1 to G2/M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The acid-induced decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was abolished by inhibition of either ERK or p38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the patients, acid exposure significantly increased the activity of p38 in the metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Acid increases proliferation and survival, and decreases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in SEG-1 cells by activating the MAPK pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Acid also activates the MAPK pathways in BE in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that acid might contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in BE through activation of MAPK pathways </plain></SENT>
