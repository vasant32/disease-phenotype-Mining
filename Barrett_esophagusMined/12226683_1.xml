<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The response to antisecretory therapy is not indicative, however, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with prolonged and severe reflux symptoms, especially if they are over the age of 60 years, are at risk of these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For them, endoscopy is the only appropriate investigation for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy should be offered only to patients who are suitable for further therapy (especially esophagectomy), and only if they understand the implications of abnormal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The published evidence suggests that the application of clear guidelines would not overwhelm health care resources, and that fewer than 20% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> would eventually undergo endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
