<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We examined the association between smoking and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), a metaplastic precursor to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a case-control study within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a new diagnosis of BE (n = 320) were matched to persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) (n = 316) and to population controls (n = 317) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information was collected using validated questionnaires from direct in-person interviews and electronic databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses used multivariate unconditional logistic regression that controlled for age, gender, race, and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ever smoking status, smoking intensity (pack-years), and smoking cessation were not associated with the risk of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses suggested that ever smoking may be associated with an increased risk of BE among some groups (compared to population controls): persons with long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] = 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.63); subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms (OR = 3.98, 95% CI 1.58-10.0); <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects (OR = 3.38, 95% CI 1.46-7.82); and persons with a large abdominal circumference (OR = 3.02, 95% CI (1.18-2.75)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Smoking was not a strong or consistent risk factor for BE in a large community-based study, although associations may be present in some population subgroups </plain></SENT>
