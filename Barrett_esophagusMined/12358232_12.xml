<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Practice guidelines recommend surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) because of the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The quality of life of patients undergoing surveillance is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to develop a new utility instrument to measure quality of life of patients undergoing BE surveillance and determine if Quality of Life in Reflux and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dyspepsia</z:e> (QOLRD) scores correlate with utility ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients were administered 16 scenarios describing possible BE surveillance outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each scenario was rated from 0 (equivalent to being dead) to 10 (equivalent to being in perfect health) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each patient also completed the QOLRD, a validated instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A t test was performed to compare the QOLRD means with published means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated for the median QOLRD score and the median utility rating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: QOLRD means ranged from 5.80 to 6.65 (previously published means 4.3-5.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lower scores denoted a worsened quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The difference was significant (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient of median QOLRD score (6.8) and median utility rating (4.0) was 0.10 (p = 0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This population of BE patients had significantly higher QOLRD scores than a previously published population referred for endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Quality of life using the utility measure was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The utility measure did not correlate with the disease-specific instrument, suggesting that the concerns of patients undergoing surveillance are distinct from their reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
