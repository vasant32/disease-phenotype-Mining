<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of diagnosis in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BOe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was examined whether: (1) there had been regular pre-treatment investigations;(2) characteristic mucosal changes had been recognized by endoscopy; (3) a diagnosis of intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> had been made more often than of advanced Barrett <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Endoscopic and associated bioptic reports on 1000 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed BOe, seen between 1990 and 1995, were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(Average age was 63 +/- 14.3 years; male to female ratio: 2.2:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 85.1% of patients the histological diagnosis was BOe without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> consisted of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 8.8%, suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 0.5%, actual or suspected low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 4.6%, actual or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 1.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic diagnosis in cases without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was in 60.8% correct for actual BOe or suspected BOe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At endoscopy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was suspected in 5.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was correct in 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repeat endoscopy a year after the initial diagnosis was performed in 9.4% with BOe and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Repeat endoscopy was performed in 37.5% of patients with an initial diagnosis of suspected low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, in 43.3% with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, in 42.9% of suspected high-grade and in 100% of actual high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> is found too late </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only half of the histologically confirmed cases are found by endoscopy and follow-up is not sufficient </plain></SENT>
