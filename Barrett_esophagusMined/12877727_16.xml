<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the distal oesophagus and especially the oesophago-gastric junction have shown an increasing incidence during the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Definition of subgroups according to different sites of development, histogenesis or aetiology may prove to be valuable for clinical diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown differences in cytokeratin patterns between Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the oesophagus and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate whether the expression of certain cytokeratins (CK7, CK20) and mucins (MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC) exhibit clear-cut patterns, thus allowing a subclassification of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the oesophago-gastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possibility of a relationship between antigen expression and the presence or absence of Barrett's metaplastic epithelium was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: CK7, CK20, MUC1, MUC2 and MUC5AC were visualized in six <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the distal oesophagus, 29 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the oesophago-gastric junction and eight <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the proximal stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CK7, CK20 and MUC1 were strongly expressed in the great majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> under study, whereas MUC2 and MUC5AC were absent or only faintly detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CK20 exhibited a significantly stronger expression in poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (G3) and MUC1 immunoreactivity correlated with tubular and papillary versus signet-ring cell histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other statistically significant correlations between antigens and histopathological features (pTNM stage, grading, histopathological subtype, presence/absence of Barrett's epithelium) were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, most <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the oesophago-gastric junction show a CK7+, CK20+, MUC1+ phenotype irrespective of the presence or absence of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical data suggest a similar histogenesis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
