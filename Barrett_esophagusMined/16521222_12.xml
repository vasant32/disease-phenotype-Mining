<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) throughout the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barretts esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: COX-2 and EGFR protein expressions were detected by using immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A detailed cytomorphological changes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Areas of COX-2 and EGFR expression were quantified by using computer Imaging System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expressions of both COX-2 and EGFR increased along with the progression from BE to esophagus <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between COX-2 expression and EGFR expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: COX-2 and EGFR may be cooperative in the stepwise progression from BE to EAC, thereby leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
