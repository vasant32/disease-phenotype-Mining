<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of invasive, occult <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (â‰¥stage 1B) in this setting has varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at operative resection for high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using an electronic medical record, we identified patients who underwent esophagectomy for high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between 1993 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative diagnosis was confirmed by reviewing endoscopic, radiologic and pathology reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative pathology reports were compared to the preoperative diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 68 patients (12 females and 56 males) with a preoperative diagnosis of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> underwent operative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 64 years (range 36 to 86 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 68 patients, 12 (17.6%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 2 (2.9%) were downgraded to low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 54 (79.4%) were confirmed as HGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 4 (5.9% of total cohort) had intramucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (Stage 1A) and 8 (11.7% of total cohort) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e> with submucosal invasion or more advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 patients with invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 4 did not have preoperative endoscopic or radiologic testing suggestive of advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in association with a preoperative diagnosis of HGD was 17.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was present in 11.7% of subjects and was clinically occult in 5.9% </plain></SENT>
