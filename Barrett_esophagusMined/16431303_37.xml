<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OCT can distinguish specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) from squamous mucosa, but image criteria for differentiating intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IMC) and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) from low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), indeterminate-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (IGD), and SIM without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> have not been validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to establish OCT image characteristics of IMC and HGD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsy-correlated OCT images were acquired from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> undergoing endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two pathologists rendered consensus diagnoses of the biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A blinded investigator reviewed the biopsy-correlated OCT images and scored each for surface maturation and gland architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each image the scores were summed to determine an OCT "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> index." RESULTS: A total of 177 biopsy-correlated images were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The corresponding histopathology diagnosis was IMC/HGD in 49 cases, LGD in 15, IGD in 8, SIM in 100, and gastric mucosa in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship was found between a histopathologic diagnosis of IMC/HGD and scores for each image feature (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> index [Spearman correlation coefficient, r = 0.50, P &lt; .0001], surface maturation [r = 0.48, P &lt; .0001], and gland architecture [r = 0.41, P &lt; .0001]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> index threshold of &gt;or=2 was used, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing IMC/HGD were 83% and 75%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An OCT image scoring system based on histopathologic characteristics has the potential to identify IMC and HGD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
