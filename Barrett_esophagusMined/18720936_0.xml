<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Screening for specialized columnar epithelium (SCE) within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) with standard video endoscopes is not reliable enough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several methods to improve accuracy of predicting presence of SCE like chromoendoscopy with vital stains or structure enhancement with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> have been introduced but data up to now remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present prospective study was conducted to evaluate a combination of chromoendoscopy and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> structure enhancement using the naturally brownish coloured balsamic vinegar during routine upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March and July 2006 20 patients with macroscopic suspicion for SCE during routine endoscopy were included prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Saline diluted balsamic vinegar (3%) was administered with a spraying catheter at the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 1 minute the distal esophagus was evaluated for the presence of SCE according to the mucosal surface pattern (pattern I-II: round pits/circular pattern predicting gastric epithelium; pattern III-IV: ridged/villous pattern predicting Barrett's epithelium) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only HR-videoendoscopes without magnification were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After presence or absence of SCE was defined by the endoscopist targeted biopsies of the CLE were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological results were compared with endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 9 of 20 patients (13 male, 7 female; mean age 60.0 +/- 12.8 years) biopsy specimen revealed SCE within CLE on histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prediction of BM after balsamic vinegar staining was possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surface pattern I-II was found in 9 patients and pattern III-IV in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for BV staining predicting SCE were 90%, 100% and 82%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Chromoendoscopy with balsamic vinegar combines the advantages of chromoendoscopy and structure enhancement by <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> for detection of SCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The reliability in predicting the presence of SCE was high in this prospective feasibility study </plain></SENT>
