<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between alcohol consumption and erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's epithelium in Japanese men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population comprised 463 men subjects who had undergone an upper endoscopy at the Gastroenterology Division of Yokohama City University Hospital between August 2005 and July 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed based on the Los Angeles Classification and the Prague C and M Criteria, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We divided the study population into four groups: never drinkers, light drinkers (less than 25.0 g of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> per day), moderate drinkers (25.0 to 50.0 g of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> per day), and heavy drinkers (more than 50.0 g of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> per day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A linear regression of the logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the dose-response trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with never drinkers, light drinkers (less than 25.0 g <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> per day), moderate drinkers (25.0 to 50.0 g per day), and heavy drinkers (more than 50.0 g per day) had ORs for erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> of 1.110 (95% CI: 0.553 - 2.228, p = 0.7688), 1.880 (95% CI: 1.015 - 3.484, p = 0.0445) and 1.988 (95% CI: 1.120 - 3.534, p = 0.0190), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These groups had ORs for Barrett's epithelium of 1.278 (95% CI: 0.752 - 2.170, p = 0.3643), 1.458 (95% CI: 0.873 - 2.433, p = 0.1500), and 1.912 (95% CI: 1.185 - 3.086, p = 0.0079), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios/grams (alcohol)/day of dose response trends for erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's epithelium were 1.015 (95% CI: 1.004-1.026, p = 0.0066) and 1.012 (95% CI: 1.003-1.021, p = 0.0079), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that alcohol consumption in Japanese men tends to be associated with an increased risk of erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
