<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal tract <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) is termed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) or gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (GIM), depending on its location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BO and GIM are associated with chemical exposure resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Paneth cells (PCs), characterised by cytoplasmic eosinophilic granules, are found in a subset of IM at these sites, but histology may not accurately detect them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine human defensin 5 (HD5; an antimicrobial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> produced by PCs) expression in BO and GIM, and to investigate its association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic biopsies from 33 patients with BO and 51 with GIM, and control tissues, were examined by routine histology and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e> and HD5 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, HD5 expression was specific for PCs in the small intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients with BE and 42 with GIM expressed HD5, but few HD5 expressing cells in IM had the characteristic histological features of PCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most HD5 positive specimens were H pylori infected and most HD5 negative specimens were not infected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HD5 immunohistochemistry was often positive in IM when PCs were absent by conventional histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, HD5 immunohistochemistry may be superior to histology for identifying metaplastic PCs and distinguishing GIM from BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The higher frequency of HD5 expression in GIM than in BO is associated with a higher frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H pylori infection</z:e>, suggesting that in IM PCs may form part of the mucosal antibacterial response </plain></SENT>
