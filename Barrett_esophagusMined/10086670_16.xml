<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) was randomly investigated among Dutch and Belgian intellectually disabled individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In six institutes including 1607 residents, 435 persons with IQ &lt;50 underwent 24-h esophageal pH-metry and were scored for possible predisposing factors and characteristic reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 49 (11.2%) cases the test failed because of technical reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A pathological pH test was defined as a pH &lt;4 for &gt;4.5% of the measured time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with a pathological pH test (patients) were compared with those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pH test (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the remaining individuals, 51.8% (200/386) showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pH test, whereas 186 showed a pathological pH test (median duration pH &lt;4: 14.2%, range: 4.5-78.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As possible predisposing factors <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo>, use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> drugs or other <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi>, and IQ &lt;35 were found, whereas symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002248'>hematemesis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0232604" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">rumination</z:e>, and depressive symptoms were indicative for reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At endoscopy reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 129 of the 186 patients (69.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 61 (47.3%) of 129 patients, grade I, 43 (33.3%) grade II, 25 (19.4%) grade III/IV (Savary-Miller) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was found in 18 (14.0%) and peptic strictures in five (3.9%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal 24-h pH-metry and symptoms suggestive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were documented frequently in a large cohort of institutionalized intellectually disabled individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further endoscopical evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in the majority of these individuals </plain></SENT>
