<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The esophageal epithelium is subject to damage from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> reflux that promotes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue injury resulting in the development of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a selection pressure for mutating p53 in this preneoplastic epithelium, thus identifying a physiologically relevant model for discovering novel regulators of the p53 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proteomic technologies were used to identify such p53 regulatory factors by identifying proteins that were overexpressed in Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A very abundant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> selectively expressed in Barrett's epithelium was identified as anterior gradient-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunochemical methods confirmed that anterior gradient-2 is universally up-regulated in Barrett's epithelium, relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous tissue derived from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfection of the anterior gradient-2 gene into cells enhances colony formation, similar to mutant oncogenic p53 encoded by the HIS175 allele, suggesting that anterior gradient-2 can function as a survival factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the C-terminal 10 amino acids of anterior gradient-2 neutralizes the colony enhancing activity of the gene, suggesting a key role for this domain in enhancing cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Constitutive overexpression of anterior gradient-2 does not alter cell-cycle parameters in unstressed cells, suggesting that this gene is not directly modifying the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, cells overexpressing anterior gradient-2 attenuate p53 phosphorylation at both Ser(15) and Ser(392) and silence p53 transactivation function in ultraviolet (UV)-damaged cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the C-terminal 10 amino acids of anterior gradient-2 permits phosphorylation at Ser(15) in UV-damaged cells, suggesting that the C-terminal motif promoting colony survival also contributes to suppression of the Ser(15) kinase pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data identify anterior gradient-2 as a novel survival factor whose study may shed light on cellular pathways that attenuate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor p53 </plain></SENT>
