<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic rise in incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the introduction and use of acid suppression therapy may be a factor in the rising incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a record linkage study, using a prescribing database and an endoscopy database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who had undergone their first endoscopy during the period 1992-1995 and received the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prescribing of acid suppressants was compared for the 3 years prior to endoscopy, between those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the Barrett's patients and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> patients in the proportion that had been exposed to acid suppression therapy (53.4% vs. 51.7%, P=0.704) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean number of days of prescribing among those who had been exposed to acid suppression therapy was higher in the Barrett's group (340.5 vs. 237.0 days, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> have received more acid suppressant therapy prior to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reasons for this are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, 46.6% of Barrett's patients have not been exposed to acid suppressant therapy </plain></SENT>
