<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differentiation of reactive epithelial atypia and mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, however, may often be difficult especially with limited biopsy material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed DNA content analysis of 11 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> showing variable reactive atypia, 24 cases of Barrett's with low- and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and 30 cases of Barrett's with invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BCA) using Feulgen-stained paraffin sections and the CAS 200 image analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean DNA index of the uniformly diploid BE was 1.06 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 1.26 mean DNA index for the low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 1.62 for high grade, and 1.88 DI for BCA were significantly greater than for variable reactive atypia (P &lt; 0.004) but not different from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six BCA cases (20%) were diploid; 24 cases (80%) were aneuploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean survival of diploid BCA at 20.4 mo was nearly double the survival of 10.6 mo for aneuploid BCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this difference was not statistically significant (P &lt; 0.21) and survival at 3 yr was identical for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BCA cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> grade, stage, and lymph node status did not significantly correlate with ploidy pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, although DNA analysis does not seem to predict ultimate outcome in BCA, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and high DNA index are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and BCA and may be of significant value in the differentiation from variable reactive atypia in small biopsies </plain></SENT>
