<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, 4N cell populations are intermixed with larger diploid fractions in vivo, limiting investigation of these key intermediates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to study elevated 4N cell populations in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, we used flow cytometry to purify populations of spontaneously arising TP53(wt) and TP53(mut) 4N cells from cell strains derived from premalignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using oligonucleotide arrays, we identified 625 genes differentially expressed in at least one replicate 2N/4N comparison in each strain and in hTERT-immortalized cultures of the TP53(mut) strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, when hierarchically clustered, these data contained a large node of 124 genes that were up-regulated in 4N TP53(mut) cells in the absence of condensed chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of these genes function in G(2)-M to mediate processes such as chromosome condensation and segregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results describe the molecular phenotype of dysregulated G(2)-M functions and cell cycle checkpoints in a key intermediate of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
