<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The effect of long-term acid suppression therapy in Barrett oesophagus remains unknown, but the high intragastric pH generated has been shown to increase the cytotoxicity of duodenal refluxate on foregut mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent work suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013299" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenogastric reflux</z:e> (DGR) may be reduced by <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> on the reflux of duodenal contents into the gastric antrum in Barrett patients and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Fifteen patients with Barrett oesophagus and 14 healthy subjects underwent oesophageal manometry followed by 24-h ambulatory oesophageal and gastric pH and gastric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> sensor (modified by the addition of a weighted tip to facilitate manoeuvrability) was sited in the gastric antrum under fluoroscopic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined ambulatory pH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> monitoring was repeated after 2 weeks on <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> 20 mg b.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes in oesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> and gastric alkaline shift due to <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> were as expected (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in total antral DGR between the Barrett and control groups (P = 0.56), and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> had no significant effect on DGR in either group (P = 0.77 and 0.27, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DGR into the antrum is of a similar level in Barrett patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">Omeprazole</z:chebi> does not reduce the reflux of duodenal contents across the pylorus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further work is required on the increased cytotoxic potential of continuing DGR in those on long-term acid suppression </plain></SENT>
