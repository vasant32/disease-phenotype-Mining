<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether or not flow-cytometric evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and increased G2/tetraploid fractions predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 62 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were evaluated prospectively for a mean interval of 34 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine of 13 patients who showed aneuploid or increased G2/tetraploid populations in their initial flow-cytometric analysis developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> during follow-up; none of the 49 patients without these abnormalities progressed to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (P less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Neoplastic progression</z:e> was characterized by progressive flow-cytometric and histological abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who progressed to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> frequently developed multiple aneuploid populations of cells that were detectable flow-cytometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, patients appeared to progress through a phenotypic sequence that could be recognized histologically by the successive appearance of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> negative for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, abnormalities in the indefinite/low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> range, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and eventually <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These and prior results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> occurs in a subset of patients who have an acquired genomic instability that generates abnormal clones of cells, some of which have aneuploid or increased G2/tetraploid DNA contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With continued genomic instability, multiple aneuploid subclones may evolve, one of which may ultimately acquire the ability to invade and become an early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of histology and flow cytometry can be used to identify a subset of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who merit more frequent endoscopic surveillance for the early detection of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
