<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if an immunohistochemical panel of p53, PCNA, and c-erbB-2 was a useful biomarker of transformation in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>P53, PCNA, and c-erbB-2 immunohistochemistry was performed on resected Barrett's specimens selected to show discrete grades of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and then on prospectively obtained biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In resection specimens, p53 was positive in 36% with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, in 30% with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, in 85% with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and in 90% of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While an evaluation of proliferation throughout the specimen did not differ between groups, surface proliferation was significantly higher in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> than in low-grade or no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> specimens were positive for at least one marker, compared to 44% with no or low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C-erbB-2 was only seen in 31% with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and in 10% of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prospectively, the panel had a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 81% and an overall accuracy of 83% in identifying patients who developed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, overexpression of p53 occurs early in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of Barrett's and increases with histologic progression, and proliferation at the surface of Barrett's epithelium increases with progressive grades of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical panel of p53 and PCNA is a useful biomarker for Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
