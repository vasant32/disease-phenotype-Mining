<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transoral intraluminal surgery is less painful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, endoscopic antireflux procedures have been unsuccessful, endoscopic foregut mucosal excision procedures are often difficult to perform, and endoscopic intra-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> suturing is both imprecise and too shallow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have endeavored to correct these deficiencies and report here new devices for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and Barrett's mucosal excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective review of ex vivo and in vivo animal experiments using sharp blade mucosal excision for esophageal and gastric mucosa and a suturing device with transverse needles designed to full thickness penetrate the gastric wall were completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 338 excisions were performed in 134 ex vivo tissue experiments and in 119 in vivo attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Suture needle testing was performed in ex vivo human stomachs and porcine stomachs and in in vivo canine and baboon stomachs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One excision <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (0.9%) occurred in a live animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory mucosal excision depth for the Barrett's device was reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progressive suture actuation reliability improved from 83% during ex vivo testing to 96.7% in in vivo experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate feasibility, reliability, and safety for gastric and esophageal mucosal excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Suturing reliability improved and further studies will be performed to finalize the instrument designs, the operative techniques, and the other device applications </plain></SENT>
