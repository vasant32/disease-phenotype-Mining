<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is a report on the laparoscopically performed floppy Nissen procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred consecutive patients were analyzed (84 women, 116 men, mean age 49 years, mean duration of symptoms 5 years) after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication between 1992 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main indications for surgery were daily heartburn, retrosternal pain, and regurgitation demanding continuous medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (4%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo>, and 21 (11%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, 24-h esophageal pH monitoring, and esophageal manometry before and 3 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a questionnaire was completed an average of 2.2 years (range 1.0-4.6) after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the study were as follows: mortality was zero, and the morbidity rate was 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean hospital stay was 3.8 +/- 2.8 days, and sick leave was 14.3 +/- 10.4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was healed or significantly improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 4 patients (98%), and 24-h pH and lower esophageal sphincter pressure were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 2 years, 87% of the patients had Visick scores of I-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that laparoscopic floppy Nissen fundoplication provides an efficient and safe alternative for surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
