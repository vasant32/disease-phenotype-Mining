<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A positive association between body mass index (BMI) and risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a precursor lesion for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac mucosa (CM) and BE are both reflux-induced metaplastic columnar epithelia in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between BMI and BE/CM in a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 174 BE patients, 333 CM patients, and 274 controls were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression methods were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for BE or CM associated with BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis was employed to examine the relationship between length of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar lined esophagus</z:e> (CLE) and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A dose-dependent relationship was found between BMI and BE (P=.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted OR for BE was 3.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-6.7) when <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals (BMI &gt;or=30 kg/m(2)) were compared to lean individuals (BMI &lt; 22 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a dose-dependent relationship was found between BMI and CM (P=.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted OR for CM comparing <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> to lean persons was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.04-3.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The length of CLE was positively related to BMI (P=.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, BMI is associated with BE and CM and appears to act early in the sequence of events leading from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> (CM and BE) to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and finally to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
