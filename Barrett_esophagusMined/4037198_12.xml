<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In three patients, microinvasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was detected before <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In five patients, the ectopic mucosa was discontinuous, prolonged cranially by islands of columnar epithelium scattered in the squamous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variable degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were found in the columnar epithelium in seven specimens in areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, several foci of intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were scattered over the whole length of the ectopic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data strongly suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> develops from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the real <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Careful periodic screening must be carried out in patients identified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> may be detected and located by endoscopy with dye spraying with directed biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> should undergo esophagectomy with resection of the whole ectopic mucosa because they are at high risk for development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
