<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many guidelines exist regarding the surveillance of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are limited data, however, with regard to whether practitioners follow these guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed current surveillance practice amongst members of the British Society of Gastroenterology using a simple 11-question anonymous survey, mailed to 300 randomly selected members from the British Society of Gastroenterology Handbook </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and three of the 300 (68%) responded, 76% considering that surveillance was worthwhile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In those who considered surveillance to be worthwhile, 83% used sub-selection based on age, the length of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> or the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> or stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> of &lt; 3 cm (short-segment) were considered to be inappropriate for surveillance by 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-one per cent reported following the 'advised' recommendations of four-quadrant biopsies every 2 cm, whereas 44% followed a 'random and suspicious areas only' protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marked variation was reported in the re-endoscope interval for both low- and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 55% reported that two experienced pathologists reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsies showing high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the existence of multiple guidelines for Barrett's surveillance, clinical practice varies widely in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may be due to a lack of knowledge or because gastroenterologists remain unconvinced by the quality of the current evidence of its value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results have implications for studies attempting to collate data from multiple centres </plain></SENT>
