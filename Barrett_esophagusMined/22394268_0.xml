<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Post-ablation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> was defined as â‰¥ 5 eosinophils per high power field during post-treatment surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty of 122 patients (16%) undergoing ablation developed esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> after ablation, including 8/77 (10%) treated with RFA and 12/44 (27%) treated with cryotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No patient had clinical or endoscopic findings of or risk factors for eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> persisted in 30% over a median of 20.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, post-ablation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> was independently associated with increasing BE segment length (adjusted odds ratio 1.46 for every 2-cm increase, 95% confidence interval 1.24-1.71) and cryotherapy as the ablation modality (adjusted odds ratio 5.23, 95% confidence interval 1.67-16.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Esophageal eosinophilic infiltration after endoscopic ablation with RFA and cryotherapy is common and is associated with the BE segment length and treatment modality </plain></SENT>
