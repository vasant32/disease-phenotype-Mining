<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Better markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk are urgently needed to identify those patients who are likely to benefit most from emerging methods of endoscopic ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease progression is associated with genomic DNA changes (segmental gains, losses, or loss of heterozygosity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although these changes are not easily assayed directly, we hypothesized that the underlying DNA damage should activate a DNA damage response (DDR), detectable by immunohistochemical (IHC) assays of checkpoint proteins and the resulting replicative phase cell cycle delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical specimens and endoscopic biopsies (N = 28) were subjected to IHC for the cell cycle markers cyclin A and phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 (P-H3), the DDR markers gammaH2AX and phosphorylated ATM/ATR substrates (P-ATM/ATRsub), and the DNA damage-responsive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors p16 and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations were made with histologic diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fractions of cells that stained for cyclin A, P-H3, and gammaH2AX increased in parallel in dysplastic tissue, consistent with checkpoint-mediated cell cycle delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Foci of nuclear gammaH2AX and P-ATM/ATRsub were demonstrated by standard and confocal immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Staining for p16 was more prevalent in early-stage disease with lower staining for gammaH2AX and P-H3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Staining for p53 was moderately increased in some early-stage disease and strongly increased in some advanced disease, consistent with checkpoint-mediated induction and mutational inactivation of p53, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that IHC for DDR-associated markers may help stratify risk of disease progression in Barrett </plain></SENT>
