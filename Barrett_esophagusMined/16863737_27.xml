<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have previously reported our experience with minimally invasive esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our standard approach involves laparoscopic and thoracoscopic mobilization of the esophagus with a cervical esophagogastric anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we report our early experience with a modification of this technique, in which a high intrathoracic anastomosis is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2002 to 2005, a minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy was performed in 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The planned approach included a totally laparoscopic abdominal procedure and either a minithoracotomy or thoracoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indications for esophagectomy included short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or resectable <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) with minimal proximal esophageal extension.  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 62.3 years (range, 38 to 79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (50%) received either preoperative chemotherapy or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was one nonemergent conversion to an open procedure during laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Planned minithoracotomy was successful in 35 patients; an additional 15 patients had the entire thoracic component performed thoracoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A circular stapled anastomosis was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality was 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients (6%) developed an anastomotic leak; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were successfully managed nonoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four patients (8%) developed postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy was technically feasible and resulted in good initial results in our center, which is experienced in minimally invasive and open esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This approach minimizes the degree of gastric mobilization, almost eliminates recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and pharyngeal dysfunction, and allows additional gastric resection margin in the case of cardia extension of GEJ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
