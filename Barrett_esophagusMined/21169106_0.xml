<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of TRPV1 receptors with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> may induce heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">Capsaicin</z:chebi> is the pungent component of chili and the most extensively studied TRPV1 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of esophageal stimulation with intraesophageal <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> administration on induction of esophageal symptoms and on esophageal chemo-sensitization to acid in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Healthy volunteers and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (non-erosive [NERD], erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> [EE] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> [BE]) were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were randomized to receive either intraesophageal perfusion <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> or saline 0.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after saline or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> infusion an acid perfusion test of HCl was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A week later, a crossover phase with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> versus saline was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five symptoms were evaluated every 5 min during the first 30 minutes after <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>, saline, and acid perfusion: chest burning, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, heartburn, epigastric burning, and epigastric pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 17 healthy subjects and 31 GERD patients (10 NERD, 11 EE, and 10 BE) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty- eight (90%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and 6 (35%) of healthy subjects had esophageal symptoms after <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean for the 5 evaluated symptoms induced by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> was significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The highest symptom severity was in the erosive subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">Capsaicin</z:chebi> decreased the 5 symptoms induced by acid perfusion in both healthy volunteers and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Total score of esophageal symptom severity (produced by acid perfusion) was significantly reduced by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> infusion in the BE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">Capsaicin</z:chebi> induces esophageal and gastric symptoms in healthy volunteers and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">Capsaicin</z:chebi> reduces esophageal chemosensitivity to acid, especially in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
