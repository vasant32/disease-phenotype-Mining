<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is being developed as a potentially valuable method for high-resolution cross-sectional imaging of the esophageal mucosal and submucosal layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One potential application of OCT imaging is to identify subsquamous Barrett's epithelium in patients who have undergone ablative therapy, which is not visible on standard endoscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, histologic correlation confirming the ability of OCT to image subsquamous Barrett's epithelium has yet to be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Histologic correlation study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To perform histologic correlation of ultrahigh-resolution optical coherence tomography (UHR-OCT) imaging for identification of subsquamous Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic Medical Center (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Fourteen patients with pathologic biopsy specimens, proven to be high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> underwent esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: UHR-OCT imaging was performed on ex vivo esophagectomy specimens immediately after resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Correlation of UHR-OCT images with histologic images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subsquamous Barrett's epithelium was clearly identified by using UHR-OCT images and was confirmed by corresponding histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Difficulty distinguishing some subsquamous Barrett's glands from blood vessels in ex vivo tissue (because of the lack of blood flow) in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Imaging was performed with a bench-top system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study demonstrate that UHR-OCT imaging is capable of identifying subsquamous Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
