<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy provides a unique molecular fingerprint of tissue from endogenous sources of light absorption; however, specific molecular components of the overall FTIR signature of precancer have not been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In attenuated total reflectance mode, infrared light penetrates only a few microns of the tissue surface, and the influence of water on the spectra can be minimized, allowing for the analyses of the molecular composition of tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, spectra were collected from 98 excised specimens of the distal esophagus, including 38 squamous, 38 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (Barrett's), and 22 gastric, obtained endoscopically from 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that DNA, protein, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> comprise the principal sources of infrared absorption in the 950- to 1,800-cm(-1) regime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of these biomolecules can be quantified by using a partial least-squares fit and used to classify <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> with high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, use of FTIR to detect premalignant (dysplastic) mucosa results in a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and total accuracy of 92%, 80%, 92%, and 89%, respectively, and leads to a better interobserver agreement between two gastrointestinal pathologists for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (kappa = 0.72) versus histology alone (kappa = 0.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that the concentration of specific biomolecules can be determined from the FTIR spectra collected in attenuated total reflectance mode and can be used for predicting the underlying histopathology, which will contribute to the early detection and rapid staging of many diseases </plain></SENT>
