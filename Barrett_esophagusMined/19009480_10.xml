<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLM) has the potential to perform in vivo microscopy to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and determine microvessel density (MVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed therefore to use this new promising imaging tool for the evaluation of MVD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLM sequences were recorded from pre-marked areas using <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> beamer coagulation spots after intravenous application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequences had to be recorded within the first 8 minutes of injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were taken from the same areas for standard histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CLM sequences were put into a random order and analyzed by a single investigator who was blinded to any clinical or histopathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five still images per sequence were analyzed for MVD using a specially designed software algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was determination of vessel diameter and MVD in relation to neoplastic or non-neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We evaluated 750 still CLM images from 150 sequences/biopsy sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histopathology revealed 69 biopsies as non-neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (46.0 %), 11 as neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (7.3 %), 64 as cardiac mucosa (42.7 %), and six as squamous mucosa (4.0 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean vessel diameter as determined by CLM was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four groups (P = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, MVD was significantly higher in CLM sequences of neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> compared with benign conditions (neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> 23.6 %; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> 14.2 %; cardiac mucosa 15.8 %; squamous epithelium 20.6 %; neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> vs. <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001, T-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fibered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-guided CLM helps to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in malignant and non-malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data might help to improve the diagnostic yield of detecting Barrett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> but also to facilitate monitoring of antiangiogenetic therapy </plain></SENT>
