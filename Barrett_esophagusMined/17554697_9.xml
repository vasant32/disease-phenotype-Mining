<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, in which patients are at greatly increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0000467'>esophageal dysplasia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the past 2 decades, there has been an increase in the incidence of both BE and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; however, the involvement of microorganisms in BE is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize microbial communities in esophageal aspirate specimens and on distal esophageal mucosal samples from patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsy and aspirate specimens were obtained by endoscopic examination from 7 patients with BE and 7 control subjects without BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples were cultured under aerobic, anaerobic, and microaerophilic conditions for yeasts and bacteria, including Helicobacter pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> isolates were identified by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> gene sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence microscopic examination was also used to determine the spatial localization of these organisms on mucosal surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant colonization was detected in 6 patients with BE and in 4 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 46 <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> species belonging to 16 genera were detected, with 10 species being common in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both aspirate and biopsy samples from patients with BE contained complex populations of bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Uniquely, high levels of Campylobacter species (Campylobacter concisus and Campylobacter rectus), which have been linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014335" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enteritis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747479" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal infections</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation in animals, were found in 4 (57%) of 7 patients with BE but in none of the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination revealed that bacteria on mucosal biofilms often occurred in microcolonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of nitrate-reducing Campylobacter species in patients with BE may suggest that there is a link in either the initiation, maintenance, or exacerbation of disease processes leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> formation </plain></SENT>
