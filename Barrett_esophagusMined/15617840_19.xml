<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize the spectrum of p16 alterations in surgically resected esophageal tissues, comprising histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal squamous and gastric epithelia, premalignant Barrett's epithelia, and associated esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, and to explore associations between p16 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and p16 mutations, deletions, promoter hypermethylation, p16 protein expression, and clinico-pathologic features for the same tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown that while p16 mutations are uncommon (2%; 1/54), hypermethylation of the p16 promoter is detected in 43% (9/21) of histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelia, in 77% (14/18) of associated Barrett's epithelia, and in 85% (18/21) of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, p16 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels (relative to matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelia) were variable in Barrett's epithelia and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, having no clear correlation with methylation status or other molecular and clinico-pathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with a role for the p16 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene early in the molecular progression of Barrett's epithelium to invasive esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, but do not support the notion that the detection of hypermethylation is systematically associated with low levels of expression </plain></SENT>
