<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of 6 months' medical treatment on BE patients was reevaluated by repeating manometry, endoscopy, and biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Esophageal manometry was performed by perfusion technique and endoscopic biopsies were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 180 patients; 20 (11%) were found to have BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of BE patients were caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BE patients had symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> for a longer time than did NBE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure in BE patients was lower than that in NBE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On medical treatment, the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> as judged by endoscopic criteria in BE patients was reduced, but there was no increase in lower esophageal sphincter pressure and no regression of the columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
