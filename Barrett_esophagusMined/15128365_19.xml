<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the high prevalence and costs of the disease, the epidemiology and natural history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> have not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has recently been suggested to abandon the current model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> as a "spectrum" disease and to adopt a new conceptual framework, e.g., categorizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> into three unique groups of patients: nonerosive reflux disease, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present review we present arguments against this proposal, and argue that the concept of a single disease, potentially progressing from mild nonerosive forms toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>), still holds true and may in fact help us in planning the diagnostic and therapeutic approach as well as in allocating financial resources much better than the proposed model of a "tripartited" disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independently from the conceptual model adopted, however, more data on the natural history of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> are eagerly needed </plain></SENT>
