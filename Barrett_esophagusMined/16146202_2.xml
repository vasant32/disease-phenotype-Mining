<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Long-term administration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> causes hyperplastic changes of the gastric parietal cells; however, the detailed mechanism remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We administered high-dose <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> for 2 years, and investigated changes in gastric ECL (Enterochromaffin-like) cells using endoscopic biopsy specimens to clarify the etiology of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the parietal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 69 patients who were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (39 males, 30 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We established two groups, an <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi>-treated group and a <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upper digestive tract endoscopy was performed before administration, and 12 and 24 months after the start of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy was performed in the greater curvature of the gastric body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ECL/parietal cell counts and the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the gastric mucosa were determined under a microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the fasting serum gastrin level was measured, and statistical analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi>-treated group, the ECL cell count was markedly increased 12 months after the start of administration, but was lower than the pretreatment value 24 months after the start of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The parietal and ECL cell counts significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were no changes in mucosa thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The fasting serum gastrin level significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi>-treated group, there was no increase in the ECL cell count, and the parietal cell count was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no significant increase in mucosa thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The fasting serum gastrin level increased, although the rate of increase was markedly smaller than that in the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Not the direct pharmacological actions of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> but hypergastrinemia-associated secondary changes may be etiologically involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the parietal cells related to long-term administration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
