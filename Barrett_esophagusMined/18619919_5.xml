<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both esophagectomy and endoscopic ablation are treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify predictors of surgical versus endoscopic therapy at a tertiary center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An institutional database identified patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> between 2003 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic data and International Classification of Diseases-9th revision codes for esophagectomy, endoscopic ablation, as well as selected medical comorbidities were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individual endoscopy, surgical, and pathology reports were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 2107 individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, 79 underwent esophagectomy and 80 underwent endoscopic ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 63.1 +/- 10.6 years in the surgical group and 69.7 +/- 9.4 years in the ablation group (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients, 9 of 76 (12%) first seen by a gastroenterologist underwent esophagectomy, whereas 18 of 21 (86%) first seen by a surgeon underwent esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression model, factors associated independently with esophagectomy were as follows: patient age of 60 or younger (odds ratio [OR], 4.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-14.9), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage T1sm or greater (OR, 16.0; 95% CI, 5.60-45.6), and initial consultation performed by a surgeon (vs gastroenterologist) (OR, 35.1; 95% CI, 9.58-129) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patient age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage predict treatment modality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment choice is influenced further by whether the initial evaluation is performed by a gastroenterologist or a surgeon </plain></SENT>
