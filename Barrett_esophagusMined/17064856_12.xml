<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this case-control study was to test the hypothesis that polymorphisms of the microsomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32955">epoxide</z:chebi> hydroxylase (mEH) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase (GST) genes modulate the susceptibility to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EADC) associated with smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases included patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) (n=126), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) (n=125), and EADC (n=56); controls comprised 95 strictly asymptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples, and PCR-based assays were used to genotype mEH (slow allele, fast allele, predicted activity) and GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to study associations between smoking and genotype, adjusting for age, gender and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to asymptomatic controls, no significant differences were found for the distribution of mEH and GST polymorphic variants in cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, BE or EADC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Smoking was a risk factor for EADC, especially when cigarette exposure was greater than 30 pack-years (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 6.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-17.32; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The strong association between smoking and EADC was seen preferentially in patients with the active allele of either GSTM1 (OR 7.9, 95% CI 1.14-54.76; P=0.003) or GSTT1 (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.23-8.35; P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for EADC, and in particular for heavy smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The strong statistical association between smoking and risk for EADC in individuals with the active allele of either GSTM1 or GSTT1 may have potential clinical application in endoscopic surveillance programs to identify individuals with BE at increased risk for progression to EADC </plain></SENT>
