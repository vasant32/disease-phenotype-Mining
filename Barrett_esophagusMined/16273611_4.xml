<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine whether the fasting levels of serum gastrin-17 (G-17) are lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) patients than in non-Barrett controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients with BE (presenting with a tubular segment &gt; or =2 cm long in lower esophagus and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> of incomplete type ("pecialized columnar epithelium") in endoscopic biopsies from the tubular segment below the squamocolumnar junction were collected prospectively from outpatients referred to diagnostic gastroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The controls comprised 199 prospectively collected dyspeptic outpatients without BE or any endoscopically visible lesions in the upper GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting levels of serum G-17 (G-17fast) were assayed with an EIA test using a mAb highly specific to amidated G-17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients and controls received therapy with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> or other antisecretory agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean and median levels of G-17fast in serum were significantly lower (P = 0.001) in BE patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive likelihood ratios (LR+) of low G-17fast to predict BE in the whole study population at G-17fast levels &lt;0.5, &lt;1, or &lt;1.5 pmol/L were 3.5, 3.0, and 2.8, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients and controls with healthy stomach mucosa, the LR+ were 5.6, 3.8, and 2.6, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the whole study population, serum G-17 was below 2 pmol/L in 15 of 19 BE patients (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The corresponding prevalence was 66 of 199 (33%) in controls (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The G-17fast was 5 pmol/L or more in only one of the 19 BE patients (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In controls, 76 of the 199 patients (38%) had such high serum G-17fast levels (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum levels of G-17fast tend to be lower in native patients with BE than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
