<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Neoplastic progression</z:e> is characterized by three well-defined premalignant stages: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide overview, based on comparative genomic hybridization, was performed, evaluating 30 Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and 25 adjacent precursors, i.e., 6 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasias</z:mpath>, 9 low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath>, and 10 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of losses and gains significantly increased in the subsequent stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Losses of 5q21-q23, 9p21, 17p12-13.1, 18q21, and Y were revealed in low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was followed by loss of 7q33-q35 and gains of 7p12-p15, 7q21-q22, and 17q21 in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> along with high-level amplification (HLA) of 7q21 and 17q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancers</z:e>, additional losses of 3p14-p21, 4p, 4q, 8p21, 13q14-q31, 14q24.3-q31, 16q21-q22, and 22q as well as gains of 3q25-q27, 8q23-24.1, 12p11.2-12, 15q22-q24, and 20q11.2-q13.1 were distinguished along with HLAs of 8p12-p22 and 20q11.2-q13.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third of the alterations in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> were also found in the adjacent <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, illustrating that multiple clonal lineages can be present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Novel findings include loss on 7q, gain on 12p, and the observation of several HLAs in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, loss of 7q33-q35 was found to represent a significant distinction between low-grade and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (P = 0.01), whereas loss of 16q21-q22 and gain of 20q11.2-q13.1 were disclosed to significantly discriminate between high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (P = 0.02 and P = 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This inventory of genetic aberrations increases our understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and might provide useful biomarkers for disease progression </plain></SENT>
