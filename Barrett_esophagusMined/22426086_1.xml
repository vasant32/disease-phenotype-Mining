<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Better criteria are needed to identify patients who should be screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) to reduce overtesting and improve the cost effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that chemopreventive agents such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, particularly aspirin, reduce the risk of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC), but little is known about their effects on BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed characteristics of patients with BE for factors that might be used in screening and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this case-controlled study, we identified 434 patients with BE diagnosed at the first endoscopy (incident cases) at a single institution (1997-2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BE cases were matched with controls on the basis of indication for endoscopy, year of endoscopy, and endoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors analyzed included age, sex, body mass index, medical and social history, and medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify clinical risk factors for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a multivariate regression model, men had a greater risk for developing BE (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-4.4), whereas current aspirin users had a lower risk than nonusers (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A subset analysis, limited to patients who had endoscopies for symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo>, yielded similar findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No interactions were found between aspirin use and smoking or use of acid-suppressive medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a case-controlled study of 434 patients with BE, current aspirin use appeared to reduce the risk of BE; previous studies associated aspirin use with a reduced risk of EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although efforts were made to minimize biases in our analysis, the possibility of residual confounding remains </plain></SENT>
