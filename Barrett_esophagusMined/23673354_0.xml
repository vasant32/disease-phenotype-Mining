<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Although patients with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) commonly undergo endoscopic surveillance, its effectiveness in reducing mortality from esophageal/gastroesophageal junction <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (EAs) has not been rigorously evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a case-control study in a community-based setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 8272 members with BE, we identified 351 EAs-70 in persons who had a prior diagnosis of BE (who were eligible for surveillance); 51 of these patients died, 38 as a result of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surveillance histories were contrasted with a sample of 101 living persons with BE (controls), matched for age, sex, and duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surveillance within 3 y was not associated with a decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from EA, (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-2.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fatal cases were nearly as likely to have received surveillance (55.3%) as were controls (60.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A BE length &gt;3 cm and prior <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were each associated with subsequent mortality, but adjustment for these did not change the main findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients should be included in evaluations of effectiveness, excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment and patients who failed to complete treatment, changed the magnitude, but not the significance, of the association (OR=0.46; 95% CI 0.13-1.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic surveillance of patients with BE was not associated with a substantially decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results do not exclude a small to moderate benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, if such a benefit exists, our findings indicate that it is substantially smaller than currently estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of surveillance was partially influenced by the acceptability of existing treatments and the occurrence of treatment-associated mortality </plain></SENT>
