<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (mean duration, 13 years) achieved significant clinical improvement after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intensive therapy with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> and metoclopramide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the 26-month follow-up period after remission, nine (45%) patients experienced a relapse of symptoms as drug dosages were tapered or discontinued, eight (40%) patients remained in remission, and three experienced a relapse of symptoms after a remission of longer than two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lower esophageal sphincter pressures were lower among patients who relapsed compared with patients with prolonged remission (4.9 vs 13.2 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug requirements to maintain symptom control were antacids alone in five patients, bedtime H2-blocker in five, full-dose H2-blocker in four, and bedtime metoclopramide (10 mg) plus an H2-blocker in six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the symptoms of three patients receiving full-dose H2-blocker therapy were controlled with antacids alone for two years, until relapse occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, some patients with severe, long-standing reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> will have a lasting response to short-term intensive medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term intensive therapy may be unnecessary in many patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower sphincter pressures may have a higher likelihood of symptomatic relapse </plain></SENT>
