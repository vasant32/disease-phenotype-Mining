<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is often characterized by the accumulation of genetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal was to evaluate the copy number alterations of several oncogene loci, including 7p12 [epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)], 8q24 (c-myc), and 20q13 in the sequence of no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization with DNA probes for the centromeric region of chromosome 7 and the locus-specific regions of 7p12 (EGFR), 8q24 (c-myc), and 20q13 was applied on 99 brush cytology specimens of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with different stages of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gains (3-4 copies) of chromosome 17, 8q24 (c-myc), and 20q.13 loci were found in the low frequencies in nondysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their frequencies increased with the stage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and reached a high incidence in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amplification (&gt;4 copies) of at least 1 of the loci was observed in 14% of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and increased to 50% in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently amplified locus was c-myc (18%), followed by 20q13 (13%) and EGFR (11%) in the high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High amplification levels (&gt;10 copies) of the loci were more frequent in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (72%) compared with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (20%; P = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Amplifications of the c-myc, EGFR, and 20q12 loci may serve as diagnostic markers to identify patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gains of the loci might be of value as prognostic markers because they are already present in nondysplasia cases and may precede the later event of the amplification as observed in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
