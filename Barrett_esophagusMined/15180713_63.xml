<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> has persistent reflux symptoms in spite of standard doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of acid and DGER in patients with reflux disease poorly responsive to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five patients (32 men, 44 +/- 2 yr) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and with persistent heartburn or regurgitation during standard <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> doses were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and simultaneous 24-h ambulatory pH and Bilitec monitoring while <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> were continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (51%) had persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (11%) had only pathological acid exposure, 25 (38%) had only pathological DGER exposure, and 17 (26%) had pathological exposure to both acid and DGER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Acid exposure under <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> was positive in only 37%, but adding Bilitec increased the diagnoses of persistent reflux to 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> had similar acid exposure, but significantly higher DGER exposure than those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> was found in patients with pathological exposure to both acid and DGER; symptoms did not differ according to the type of reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined pH and Bilitec monitoring is superior to pH monitoring alone in demonstrating ongoing pathological reflux in patients with medically poorly responsive reflux disease </plain></SENT>
