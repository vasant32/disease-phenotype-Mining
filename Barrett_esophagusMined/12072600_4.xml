<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There has been a dramatic increase in recent years in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and the oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> associated with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alongside surgical treatment for early Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, endoscopic treatment procedures such as photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>), which have much lower complication and mortality rates, will play an increasing role in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effects of light energy dose, light fractionation and oxygenation on the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> were investigated for the first time in an in-vivo <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> model bearing a human Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A total of 387 NMRI strain (nu/nu) <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice with thymic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (total 53 controls) were transplanted with human Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and treated with laser light at 635 nm (light dose 0-200 J/cm2, fluence rate 400 mW/cm2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5-Aminolaevulinic acid-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX (5-ALA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi>) (100 mg 5-ALA/kg body weight administered orally) was used as the photosensitizer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fractionation studies were performed at 0, 50, 100 and 150 J/cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The light dose was administered in four equal fractions divided by three irradiation-free intervals of 120 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Oxygenation studies were carried out at 150 J/cm2 with simultaneous oxygen supply of 2, 6 and 8 l oxygen/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dosimetry studies demonstrated a positive correlation between increase in light dose and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> destruction up to 150 J/cm2 when using either continuous or fractionated light delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The optimal light energy dose was 150 J/cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither fractionation of light nor simultaneous oxygenation enhanced the efficacy of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first study in the literature that proves the efficiency of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> with 5-ALA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> in human Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and that demonstrates an exact dosimetry of the optimal light energy dose (150 J/cm2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No general recommendation can be made for the use of fractionation or oxygenation in clinical <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
