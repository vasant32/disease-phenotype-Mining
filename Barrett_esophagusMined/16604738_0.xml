<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) Marketing authorisation has been granted for a photodynamic treatment based on intravenous porfimer injection and laser illumination of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3) In a randomised trial comparing porfimer photodynamic therapy plus <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi> alone, 208 patients were monitored for at least 2 years </plain></SENT>
