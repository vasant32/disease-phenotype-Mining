<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) is a new local, endoscopically controlled therapeutic technique based on the sensitization of malignant and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> prior to light-induced tissue destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, or of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137,C0751688" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous-cell cancer</z:e> of the esophagus, requires light application devices allowing homogeneous illumination of the tissue surface in spite of esophageal motility and respiratory movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of a commercially available through-the-scope balloon system, we developed a long-range light applicator for homogeneous and circumferential irradiation during <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, and describe here the initial clinical experience with the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The new balloon applicator consists of a flexible cylindrical diffuser fiber with a length of up to 10 cm, depending on the lesion to be illuminated, and an inflatable balloon based on the type of balloon used for <z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>esophageal dilation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The balloon is made of a transparent <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi> membrane with negligible absorption (&lt;5%) at lambda = 600-700 nm, and it can be positioned through the biopsy channel of a conventional endoscope, with direct endoscopic visualization of the targeted lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The light intensity distribution perpendicular to the optical axes of the diffuser was measured for red laser light (lambda = 632.8 nm) and for green laser light (lambda = 542 nm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study of photodynamic treatment included two women and four men (aged 48-79 years) with histologically proved high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 2) or mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 2) and superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007137,C0751688" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">squamous-cell cancer</z:e> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) (n = 2), who had undergone EUS staging showing uT0 or uT1N0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laser light irradiation was conducted after oral ingestion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">5-aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> (5-ALA) or intravenous administration of meta-(tetrahydroxyphenyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36303">chlorin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9437">mTHPC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both in vitro and in vivo, precise positioning of the new application system at the targeted tissue and homogeneous illumination were feasible, safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total efficiency of transmitted light at wavelengths of lambda = 632.8 nm and lambda = 542 nm was 85-90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A high degree of homogeneity was measured with applicator lengths of between 15 mm and 95 mm, and the maximum deviation from the mean intensity extended over a range of 40% over the total length of 80 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was eradicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and in addition mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was successfully destroyed in three-quarters of them, requiring an average of 1.3 treatment sessions, with a mean follow-up of 12 months (range 10-15 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This centering balloon system may in the future be capable of improving light application techniques during esophageal photodynamic therapy, making <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> a more reliable alternative modality for minimally invasive treatment of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, as compared with esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
