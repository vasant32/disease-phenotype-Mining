<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunostaining was analysed on a total of 192 biopsy samples of 22 Barrett's patients with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND), 17 with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), 20 high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and 24 with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nuclear FXR expression was observed in 15 of 22 (68%) ND cases versus none of 19 HGD; 3 of 17 (18%); LGD; 5 of 60 (8%) patients with AC (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FXR expression was highly specific for non-dysplastic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear PXR was expressed in 16 of 20 (80%) HGD cases versus two of 16 (13%) LGD cases (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon examining adjacent tissue taken from HGD and AC patients, PXR expression was high in samples of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissue types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear receptors are expressed differentially during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e>, with FXR positivity being useful to distinguish ND from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PXR nuclear expression is able to separate HGD from LGD and ND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of FXR and PXR also appears to have diagnostic and possibly prognostic value, but future prospective studies are required to investigate their predictive power for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in Barret's oesophagus </plain></SENT>
