<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Esophageal cancer</z:e> is one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>; highlighting the need to identify biomarkers for early detection and prognostic classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our recent studies have identified inflammatory gene and microRNA signatures derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and nontumor tissues as prognostic biomarkers of hepatocellular, lung, and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we examine the relationship between expression of these inflammatory genes and micro <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (miRNA) expression in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We measured the expression of 23 <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-associated genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues from 93 patients (58 Barrett's and 35 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>) by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were used to build an inflammatory risk model, based on multivariate Cox regression, to predict survival in a training cohort (n = 47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then determined whether this model could predict survival in a cohort of 46 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression data for miRNA-375 were available for these patients and was combined with inflammatory gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-8, IL-21, IL-23, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and nontumor samples were each associated with poor prognosis based on Cox regression [(Z-score)&gt;1.5] and therefore were used to generate an inflammatory risk score (IRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with a high IRS had poor prognosis compared with those with a low IRS in the training (P = 0.002) and test (P = 0.012) cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association was stronger in the group with Barrett's history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When combining with miRNA-375, the combined IRS/miR signature was an improved prognostic classifier than either one alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transcriptional profiling of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-associated genes and miRNA expression in resected esophageal Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissues may have clinical utility as predictors of prognosis </plain></SENT>
