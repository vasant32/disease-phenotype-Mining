<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) plays a major role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we demonstrated that duration of esophageal acid exposure in the distal esophagus correlates with the length of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship between the rate of the change in acid exposure along the esophagus and the length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 17 patients (16 men and one woman; mean age 66 +/- 15 yr, range 41-83 yr) with varying lengths of biopsy-proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were recruited prospectively into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring was performed using a commercially available pH probe with four sensors located 5 cm apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each patient, a least squares regression line of the fraction of the study that the pH was &lt;4 against the height of the sensor above the lower esophageal sphincter was fit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The slope of the regression line was used to represent the rate of change in acid exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between the rate of change in acid exposure and the length of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean Barrett's length was 5 +/- 3 cm (range 1-11 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Linear regression demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between the rate of change in acid exposure and the length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> for the 24-h duration of the study, as well as for the fraction of the study that patients were in the upright position (p = 0.0096 and 0.0076, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the supine position, the relationship did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.095) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a significant relationship between the rate of change in acid exposure and the length of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, as the rate at which recorded acid exposure values increases from the proximal to distal esophagus, the length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> significantly increases (for percent total time and upright position) </plain></SENT>
