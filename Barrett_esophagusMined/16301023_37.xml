<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Numerous ablative modalities have demonstrated varying degrees of efficacy in the eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, they are associated with either high cost, patient discomfort, complications, tedious application, residual underlying BE, or some combination of the above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of a new cryogenic device by using liquid nitrogen sprayed through an open tipped cryogenic catheter placed through the accessory channel of an upper endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective, single center study was performed on patients with a long-standing history of BE followed in a Barrett's registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> ranging from none to multifocal high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with 40 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8768">rabeprazole</z:chebi> 3 times per day during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> was confirmed via 24-hour esophageal pH studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cryoablation was applied hemicircumferentially to 4-cm-long segments at monthly intervals, until the entire segment of BE was eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was reversal of BE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 9 of 11 (78%) patients who completed the protocol, there was complete endoscopic and histologic reversal of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no subsquamous specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on preliminary results, low-pressure spray cryoablation of BE under direct endoscopic visualization is safe and easy to perform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Its relative lack of patient discomfort and its simplicity and demonstrated efficacy make it a modality that should be further explored in the ablation of GI mucosal lesions such as BE and perhaps early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
