<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients operated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> between 1989 and 1995 were included in this study, excluding perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Were studied as potential prognosis factors: age, sex, operative intent, transfusion, digestive transplant, Barrett <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, stage, tumoral extension (T), nodal involvement (N), distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (M), tumoral differentiation, pre- or post-operative neoadjuvant treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up was 2 to 100 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 21 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, and 12 months for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, factors influencing survival were, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>: nodal involvement (N) (p = 0.0003), stage (p = 0.006), and operative intent (p = 0.04); for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>: tumoral differentiation (p = 0.0015), local extension (T) (p = 0.0022), stage (p = 0.0043), nodal involvement (N) (p = 0.0052), operative intent (p = 0.006), and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, independent prognosis factors were, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, nodal involvement (N) (p = 0.0002), and for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, operative intent (p = 0.0018) and tumoral differentiation (p = 0.0014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> at an early stage is the most important prognosis factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study failed to show any significant benefit from neoadjuvant treatment, in term of long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with poor prognosis factors, such as determined by accurate preoperative staging, could potentially benefit from more aggressive multimodal therapies </plain></SENT>
