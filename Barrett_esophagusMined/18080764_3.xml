<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 707 patients reviewed, 203 (125 males and 78 females) had BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>gallstones</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the patients with BE than in those without BE (34 vs. 20%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gallbladder functions of 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, 27 patients with BE and 21 healthy volunteers were assessed by ultrasonography before and after a test meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with BE had significantly higher fasting volume and residual volume, but lower ejection volume, ejection fraction and ejection rate values than those of the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the ultrasonographic parameters of patients without BE were significantly different from those of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE have a more complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854121" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal motility disorder</z:e> that involves the gallbladder, and this makes this subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> more prone to <z:mp ids='MP_0002830'>gallstone</z:mp> disease </plain></SENT>
