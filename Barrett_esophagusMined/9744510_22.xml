<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the mechanism of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> accumulation after the administration of ALA and to investigate whether ALA-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX might be a suitable photosensitizer in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, we determined the activities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17381">porphobilinogen</z:chebi> deaminase (PBG-D) and ferrochelatase (FC) in various malignant and premalignant as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues of the human oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> power index for ALA-induced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> accumulation, the ratio of PBG-D to FC normalized for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium of the oesophagus, was calculated to evaluate intertissue variation in the ability to accumulate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In malignant and premalignant tissue a twofold increased PBG-D activity and a marginally increased FC activity was seen compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significantly increased <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> power index in Barrett's epithelium and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that, after the administration of ALA, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrins</z:chebi> will accumulate in a greater amount in Barrett's epithelium and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus because of an imbalance between PBG-D and FC activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> power index here defined might be a useful indicative parameter for predicting the susceptibility of these tissues to ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
