<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and pathologic features, and prognostic significance, of prominent mucin pools in 21 patients identified from a cohort of 192 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients (prevalence rate, 10.9%) who had an esophagectomy (post-chemrad) for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical and pathologic features and follow-up data were evaluated in 21 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and with prominent mucin pools (male-to-female ratio, 21:0; mean age, 61 years) and compared with a control group of 19 consecutive chemrad-treated and stage-matched esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients who had either minimal microscopic (9 cases) or no (10 cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> present in their resection specimen (male-to-female ratio, 18:1; mean age, 62 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 21 study patients, 7 (33%) had acellular mucin pools with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e>, 7 (33%) showed rare isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells within mucin pools, and 7 (33%) had acellular mucin pools with microscopic foci of residual <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in tissue adjacent to, but not within, mucin pools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 2 cases (9%) showed mucin pools limited to the submucosa, 5 (24%) showed involvement of the muscularis propria, and 14 (67%) showed mucin pools within the muscularis propria and adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four cases (19%) showed involvement of the radial resection margin with acellular mucin pools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen study patients (62%) contained acellular mucin pools within regional lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher proportion of patients with prominent mucin pools had mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> prior to neoadjuvant therapy, compared with control patients without mucin pools (12 of 21 (57%) vs. 1 of 19 (5%), P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upon follow-up (mean, 27 months; range, 5-84 months), none of the study patients with prominent mucin pools died of disease (0%), in comparison to 5 of 19 (26%) control patients (mean follow-up, 27 months; range, 3-64 months) (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients who had acellular mucin pools involving the radial margin developed recurrence or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> or died of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prominent mucin pools in resection specimens from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> who received preoperative chemrad are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334811" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mucinous tumors</z:e> and are not associated with poor survival, even when acellular mucin pools involve the radial margin, and, thus, should not be interpreted as evidence of residual viable <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
