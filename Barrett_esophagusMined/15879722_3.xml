<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this is still a matter of some controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic usefulness of cytokeratin 7/20 immunostaining for short-segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, diagnosed endoscopically, at least two biopsy specimens were taken from just below the squamocolumnar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If goblet cells were found histologically with alcian blue staining, cytokeratin 7/20 immunohistochemical stains were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the cardia was diagnosed whenever biopsy specimens taken from within 2 cm below the oesophagogastric junction revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern was defined as cytokeratin 20 positivity in only the superficial gland, combined with cytokeratin 7 positivity in both the superficial and deep glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern was observed in 28 out of 36 cases (77.8%) with short-segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, 11 out of 28 cases (39.3%) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> at the cardia, and nine out of 61 cases (14.8%) with gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern were 77.8 and 77.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25% </plain></SENT>
