<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BE is associated with long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and carries an increased risk for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little if any is known regarding the differentiation state of esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and its relationship to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the potential of villin, a cytoskeletal protein, and Ep-CAM, a glandular epithelial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, to serve as markers for enterocytic differentiation in BE at the molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic mucosal biopsy samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, BE, stomach and duodenum were collected from 23 patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were analyzed for villin and Ep-CAM expression by immunoblotting, and in some cases for the presence of microvilli by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By mapping of BE segments in 6 patients, correlations were also made between the histologic evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and villin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Villin was uniformly expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> duodenal samples but was not detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus and stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In BE biopsies, villin expression was limited to the subset of patients whose adjacent biopsies showed microvilli by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In several patients studied, however, the expression of villin and the epithelial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> Ep-CAM differed among various regions of esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> within the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mapping studies failed to reveal any correlation among histologic evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and villin expression and confirmed the multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of villin expression in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preliminary data of 4 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients studied showed that villin expression was absent in 3 and very low in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ep-CAM was highly expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results show that BE represents a complex epithelium with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in antigen expression and ultrastructural morphologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> supports the presence of different stages of differentiation within the same epithelium </plain></SENT>
