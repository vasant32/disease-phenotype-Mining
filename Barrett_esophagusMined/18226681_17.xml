<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgery is the standard treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> located at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ), and, recently, EMR, photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>), or both have also been used for early stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> located at the EGJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a newly developed technique in the field of endoscopic treatments for GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> because of its high rate of en bloc resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We used ESD for superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> located at the EGJ and evaluated its clinical impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twenty-five lesions of superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> located at the EGJ from 24 patients were treated with ESD between June 2001 and January 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> located at the EGJ was defined as a "junctional <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (type II)" according to Siewert's classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Complications, en bloc resection rate, curative resection rate, local recurrence, and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No complications except stenosis occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The en bloc resection rate was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen lesions (72.0%) were judged as "curative resection" and showed no local or distant recurrence during a median follow-up period of 30.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven lesions were diagnosed as "noncurative resection." Two patients underwent additional surgical resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 1 of 2 of the surgical resections, however, we could not identify a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, who refused additional surgical resection, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> were found after 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The limitation of the study was its retrospective design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After long-term follow-up, although surgery for a noncurative resection remains a standard treatment, ESD can be adequately adopted as an effective treatment for superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> at the EGJ </plain></SENT>
