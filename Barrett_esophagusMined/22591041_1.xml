<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is still not clear whether IM in the gastric cardia or columnar mucosa without IM in the lower esophagus have any significance as BE, which is considered as preneoplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the immunohistochemical features of BE and columnar mucosa in the distal esophagus and also to evaluate the value of chromoendoscopy in the diagnosis of BE in a prospective manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 12 chromoendoscopic biopsies (six from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-looking unstained esophagus and six from esophageal mucosa stained with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> blue suspicious of BE) were taken from 111 cases who underwent endoscopy because of a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal symptoms</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using CK7, CK20, p53, Ki67, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 111 cases, 19 cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (nine adeno, six squamous, four undifferentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) and 17 cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium were excluded, while 75 cases showing columnar epithelium, including 46 (61.3%) with IM and 29 (38,7%) without IM, were further evaluated immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CK7 was observed in surface, crypt, and glandular epithelium, whereas CK20 was expressed in surface and superficial crypt epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between the Barrett and non-Barrett type of CK7/20 staining pattern (P &gt; 0,05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of p53 did not show any difference between BE and columnar mucosa without IM, whereas COX2 expression was significantly increased in BE (P &lt; 0.05) in comparison with columnar mucosa without IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ki67 expression was significiantly higher both in upper and lower crypts in BE (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that a Barrett pattern does not seem to exist; however, the analysis of COX2 expression and the Ki67 proliferation fraction by immunohistochemistry can be used to separate BE from non-Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our point of view, the immunohistochemical detection of p53 expression in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> stage is useless as a marker for early detection of high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
