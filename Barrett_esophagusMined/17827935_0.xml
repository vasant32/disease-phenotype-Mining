<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controlled trials in non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) patients have shown sufficient symptom control in most patients with a high rate of willingness to continue treatment and substantial saving on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, due to the slow <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>, rescue antacids are often used when symptoms recur and several patients continue to experience some degree of heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On-demand treatment is less cost-saving in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and symptomatic/endoscopic relapses occur frequently in severe grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on the prevention of long-term sequelae of on-demand treatment are scarce, only indirect evidence being available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> continuous maintenance is more appropriate than on-demand therapy in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> where <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> may reduce incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, in uninvestigated elderly patients where <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> is more prevalent and it is more frequently complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> and possibly in uninvestigated or NERD patients with frequent clinical relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, more appropriate outcome variables should be used in future trials in order to assess efficacy of on-demand treatment adequately </plain></SENT>
