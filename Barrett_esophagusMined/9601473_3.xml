<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to find out whether premalignant or suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> can be diagnosed by preceding sensitization with 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), which in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is transformed in increased amounts into photosensitizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX, the latter being recognized by its characteristic red fluorescence on exposure to blue light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 patients with known mild or moderately severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, n = 8; colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, n = 3; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> n = 2, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003299'>gastric polyps</z:mp> or mucosal changes suspicious of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, n = 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, who after radio- and chemotherapy were endoscopically free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, were sensitized with different concentrations of ALA (orally: 5-30 mg/kg; or locally: 3 g in 100 ml 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) took place 4-8 h after oral and ca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1-2 h after local sensitization with blue light (D-light, Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Definite red fluorescence with demonstration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found in three of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopies from nonfluorescent areas were free of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (10 mg/kg ALA with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were definitively endoscopically by their red fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found in a non-fluorescent area after radio- and chemotherapy of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasias</z:mpath> were also seen in the rectal biopsy after local applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PDD makes it possible for the first time to visualize <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> of the gastrointestinal tract after preceding ALA sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PDD is a highly promising method for monitoring patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> and an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and for clarifying the diagnosis of mucosal changes suspicious of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
