<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate proliferative patterns in metaplastic columnar epithelia of the oesophagus, classified as oxynto-cardiac (n = 43), cardiac (n = 45) intestinal without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 41), dysplastic intestinal epithelium (n = 25), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 15) by Ki67 immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Abnormal patterns of Ki67 immunoreactivity were classified into (i) expanded proliferation, characterized by increased levels of Ki67 expression in the deep and mid third of the foveolar pit; and (ii) aberrant proliferation, characterized by positive staining in the surface epithelium and superficial third of the foveolar pit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant step-wise increase in the frequency of expanded proliferation was seen in oxynto-cardiac, cardiac, intestinal and dysplastic intestinal epithelium indicative of increasing levels of damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aberrant proliferation was absent in oxynto-cardiac mucosa, present at a low and similar level in cardiac, intestinal and low-grade dysplastic epithelia and at a significantly increased frequency in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that oxynto-cardiac mucosa occurs in a low damage environment and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in a high damage environment along the length of the columnar lined oesophageal segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aberrant proliferative patterns with Ki67 staining are not useful in differentiating reactive epithelia from low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, but may prove useful in the diagnosis of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
