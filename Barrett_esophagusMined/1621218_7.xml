<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> have a higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> than has the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Local tissue injury and exposure to carcinogens presumably play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e>, but the possibility of altered host immune surveillance must also be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The level of immunoreactivity was investigated in six healthy control subjects; 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, seven with and seven without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>; and nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parameters studied were (1) T-cell and B-cell function with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated lymphocyte blastogenesis, (2) immunosuppressive properties of autologous serum, and (3) interleukin-2 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nutritional status as a possible cause for immunosuppression was assessed by measurement of serum albumin, transferrin, and prealbumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had a significant suppression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> T-cell (p less than 0.01) and B-cell function (p less than 0.01) and interleukin-2 production (p less than 0.001) when they were compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-2 production was also reduced significantly compared to that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in serum immunosuppression or nutritional factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the immunosuppression observed in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was milder than that found in other immunocompromised states, it may be sufficient to encourage the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
