<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated the role of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamins C</z:chebi> and E in the prevention of potentially premalignant modifications to DNA in the human stomach by supplementing patients who, because of <z:mp ids='MP_0008001'>hypochlorhydria</z:mp> and possible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of gastric <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, could be at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing surveillance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (n 100), on long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> were randomized into two groups: <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (500 mg twice/d) and vitamin E (100 mg twice/d) for 12 weeks (the supplemented group) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those attending for subsequent endoscopy had gastric juice, plasma and mucosal measurements of vitamin levels and markers of DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>, total <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and vitamin E were elevated in the supplemented group consistent with compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gastric juice <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> and total <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> levels were raised significantly in the supplemented group (P=0.01) but supplementation had no effect on the mucosal level of this vitamin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, gastric juice <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> and total <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges in the unsupplemented group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mucosal malondialdehyde, chemiluminescence and DNA damage levels in the comet assay were unaffected by vitamin supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, supplementation does not affect DNA damage in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is probably because long-term inhibition of the gastric proton pump alone does not affect gastric juice <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> and therefore does not increase the theoretical risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> because of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
