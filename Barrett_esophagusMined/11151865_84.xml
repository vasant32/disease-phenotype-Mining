<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The reported risk of progression from low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (CA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> varies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the validity of a diagnosis of LGD may be questioned because of interobserver variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A search of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation surgical pathology files between 1986 and 1997 yielded biopsy specimens from 43 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosed and coded as LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with concurrent or prior diagnoses of HGD or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LGD cases were randomized and blindly reviewed by three gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists along with cases originally diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (ND; n = 28), indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (IND; n = 14), or HGD (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each pathologist classified every biopsy specimen as ND, IND, LGD, or HGD, and interobserver agreements were determined by kappa statistics (K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were available on 25 patients originally diagnosed with LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Progression was defined as a subsequent diagnosis of HGD or CA on esophageal biopsy or resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Agreement between two GI pathologists for a diagnosis of LGD was fair (K = 0.28) and poor (K = 0.21 and -0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individual GI pathologists agreed with the original diagnosis of LGD in 70%, 56%, and 16% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 25 patients with follow-up included 21 men and four women (mean age, 67 yr) with a mean follow-up of 26 months (range: 2-84 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (28%) with follow-up developed HGD (five patients) or CA (two patients), 2-43 months (median: 11 months) after a diagnosis of LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The individual GI pathologists' diagnosis did not correlate with progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, when at least two GI pathologists agreed on LGD, there was a significant association with progression (seven of 17 patients, 41%, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three GI pathologists agreed on a diagnosis of LGD, four of five patients progressed (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In contrast, of the eight patients with follow-up and no agreement among GI pathologists for a diagnosis of LGD, none progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high degree of interobserver variability is seen in the histological diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>-related LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although the number of observations is low, a consensus diagnosis of LGD among GI pathologists suggests an increased risk of progression from LGD to HGD or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
