<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic biopsy specimens were taken from the columnar epithelium from 23 patients (n = 93), and in addition from the cardia from eight healthy control subjects (n = 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The tissue was stained by the immunoperoxidase technique with specific anti-pepsinogen antisera, and double immunostained for <z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the Barrett's epithelium <z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi> was found in 28 out of 93 biopsy specimens (30.1%) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi> in 55 out of 93 (59.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chief cells always stained both for <z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi> + </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic epithelium stained always negatively with both anti-pepsinogen antisera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most control cardia biopsy specimens <z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi> as well as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi> were demonstrable; occasionally clear mucous glands were <z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi> - and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that pepsinogen-containing cells can be accurately identified in the Barrett's epithelium; their presence seems related to the histological cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Identification of pepsinogen positive cells may contribute to a more accurate morphological classification of the Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
