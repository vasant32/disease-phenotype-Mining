<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of this condition is the associated predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three types of BE have been characterized: the gastric fundic (F) type, the gastric cardial (C) type, and the intestinal (I) type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter is the most closely associated with the development of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi>; the causes of this bias remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether p53 and/or K-ras gene alterations (a) are present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_481'>preneoplastic lesions</z:mpath> and (b) are associated with a specific histotype, we performed PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of exon 1 (codons 12-13) of K-ras gene and of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene in biopsies obtained from 30 patients with BE of the I type (9 patients), combined I type (I + C +/- F; 10 patients) and non-I type (C, F, or C + F; 11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the cases under study revealed K-ras mutations, whereas biopsies from 12 patients showed at least one p53 DGGE variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients showed the exact same variants in leukocytes also (polymorphisms), whereas eight cases revealed specific DGGE variants only in biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The molecular characterization of these variants revealed that four of them showed a single base pair substitution, and four showed multiple mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 were base pair substitutions located mainly in exons 7 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of these mutations were GC targeted (13 of 16; 81%), 54% (7 of 13) of which were transitions occurring at CpG sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> were found in BE with at least one I component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association with the histotype was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.03; pure I type versus non-I type; P &lt; 0.04, combined I type versus non-I type; Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Loss of heterozygosity in the vicinity of the p53 locus was evaluated by PCR using a highly polymorphic variable number of tandem repeats marker on 25 out of 30 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two % of the cases analyzed were informative, and none of them showed LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we showed that p53 mutations are frequently observed in specimens from BE patients of the I-type, whereas no involvement of K-ras (exon 1) mutational activation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In light of the key roles that the p53 protein plays in controlling cell cycle and cell diploidy, this result may suggest why this type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> is the most closely associated to the development of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
