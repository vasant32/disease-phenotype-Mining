<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Multiband mucosectomy (MBM) is a relatively new technique for endoscopic resection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This ligate-cut technique uses a modified variceal band ligator allowing for six consecutive resections without prior submucosal lifting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to evaluate the safety of MBM and its efficacy for complete endoscopic removal of delineated target areas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective registration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MBM procedures in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was carried out between November 2004 and October 2009 in two hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to MBM, the target area was delineated with coagulation markings, followed by endoscopic resection until the delineated area was completely resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (during procedure) plus early complications (&lt;30 days) and the rate of complete endoscopic resection of the delineated target area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 243 MBM procedures, with 1060 resections, were performed in 170 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MBM was performed for focal lesions (n=113), for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> removal as part of a (stepwise) radical endoscopic resection protocol (n=117), and as escape treatment after radiofrequency ablation (n=13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complication was <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (in 3%, endoscopically managed); no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> occurred despite absence of submucosal lifting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early complications consisted of delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (in 2%, endoscopically managed) and stenosis, which occurred in 48% of patients treated in a (stepwise) radical resection protocol; patients treated for focal lesions or in escape treatment showed no stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete endoscopic resection was achieved in 91% of the focal lesions, in 86% of cases treated under the (stepwise) radical endoscopic resection protocol, and 100% for escape treatment after radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MBM is a safe and effective technique for the removal of delineated target areas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
