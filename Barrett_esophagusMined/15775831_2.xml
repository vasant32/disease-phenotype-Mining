<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term effects of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="25434">mustard gas</z:chebi> (MG) and propose a screening protocol to prevent complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Follow-up of (n = 247) workers exposed to MG with a standard protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Healing of burns varied according to natural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> of skin, not reported elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001581'>skin infections</z:hpo> developed on burns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Liver functions and cardiac conduction were temporarily altered in burn cases without other complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No fatalities were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Months after exposure, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006277" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchitis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038436" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="PTSD">posttraumatic stress disorder</z:e> became prevalent regardless of initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other symptoms did not lead to any organ pathology except one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and another of oral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two infants conceived after exposure appeared healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the screening protocol administered became an effective screening tool, follow-up of cases was severely flawed by a lack of cooperation between providers and noncompliance by patients after settlement of lawsuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Research of findings attributable to MG needs close follow-up of this group of patients due to latent carcinogenic, hematologic, pulmonary, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, annual follow-up screens, instruction on the effects of MG, and prevention, including immunization and autopsy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, are strongly suggested </plain></SENT>
