<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were examined for expression of the intestinal brush-border-associated hydrolase aminopeptidase N (APN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>APN <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected by utilizing the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 50% of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> specimens and in 26% of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APN protein was detected by utilizing immunohistochemistry in 84% of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> specimens and in 71% of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, although a decrease or loss of APN protein was sometimes observed in dysplastic Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene have previously been found in both dysplastic Barrett's mucosa and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same specimens analyzed for APN were examined for the nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Utilizing immunohistochemistry, p53 staining was detected in 42% of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> specimens, most of which were dysplastic, and in 58% of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the samples positive for p53 protein, gene mutations in exons 5, 7 and 8 were detected by utilizing single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) in 1 Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> specimen and 6 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, there was an inverse correlation between APN protein expression and p53 protein accumulation (p &lt; 0.05) suggesting a link between genetic alterations and loss of this marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The analysis of markers of intestinal differentiation with markers of disease progression may prove to be a useful approach for studying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
