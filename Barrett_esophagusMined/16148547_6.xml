<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The reported incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> in surveillance programmes varies widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Great Britain has one of the highest incidence rates of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the world, but there are no data from Ireland reporting its incidence in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> undergoing surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We carried out a study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such patients at a large District General Hospital in Northern Ireland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> from January 1986 to March 2004 at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Derry, Northern Ireland was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> was defined as specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> present in the tubular oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 277 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and two patients had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> at initial endoscopy and were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 254 patients, 178 were entered into the surveillance programme (127 men, 51 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up period was 3.4 years, resulting in 613 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, an incidence of 1/204 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients had early-stage (T1 or T2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> detected and are alive and well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 429 surveillance endoscopies were performed, and a marked year-on-year increase in the workload generated as a result of the surveillance programme was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients in Northern Ireland was similar to the incidence reported by other large institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical benefit is suggested but is not certain from these data, because of biases that affect surveillance programmes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Large multicentre studies are required to determine whether surveillance is beneficial </plain></SENT>
