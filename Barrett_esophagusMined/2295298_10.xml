<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed on biopsies of columnar mucosa from 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and 11 patients with columnar mucosa in the cranial esophagus, the "inlet patch." Both epithelia contained <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells, immunoreactive to antisera against <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>; the specialized mucosa of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> contained, in addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi>-immunoreactive cells, and in the mucosa of an inlet patch we found a gastrin cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings are not compatible with some of the current theories on the origin of these epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mucosa of the inlet patch has been considered to consist of heterotopic gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mucosa of the adult human stomach, however, does not contain glucagon cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells are only present in the early embryonic stomach, and they disappear during embryonogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to our findings, the mucosa of the inlet patch therefore represents embryonic gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specialized columnar epithelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has been considered to have evolved from gastric mucous neck cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, although glucagon cells are a feature of the embryonic stomach, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7542">neurotensin</z:chebi>-immunoreactive cells have not been found in the gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that the specialized columnar epithelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> originates from a very immature multipotent gastrointestinal stem cell </plain></SENT>
