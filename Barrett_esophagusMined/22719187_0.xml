<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine if the observed paracellular <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> leak in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients is due to their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The in vivo <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> permeability test was administered to healthy controls, to Barrett's patients and to non-Barrett's patients on continuous <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Degree of leak was tested for correlation with presence of Barrett's, use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi>, and length of Barrett's segment and duration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Barrett's patients manifested a near 3-fold greater, upper gastrointestinal <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> leak than healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decrease of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> leak was observed in Barrett's patients who ceased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use for 7 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although initial introduction of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use (in a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>-na√Øve population) results in dramatic increase in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> leak, long-term, continuous <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use manifested a slow spontaneous decline in leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> leak observed in Barrett's patients showed no correlation to the amount of Barrett's tissue present in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although future research is needed to determine the degree of paracellular leak in actual Barrett's mucosa, the relatively high degree of leak observed with in vivo <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> permeability measurement of Barrett's patients reflects their <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> use and not their Barrett's tissue per se </plain></SENT>
