<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to assess the prevalence and characteristic hormonal profile of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells in Barrett's mucosa and to determine to what extent this profile was shared by <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arising therefrom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, lower oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, not associated with columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, were examined to see if they exhibited a different hormonal profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients studied comprised 43 who had had multiple oesophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>35 who had had oesophagogastric resection for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in Barrett's mucosa and 26 in whom the resection showed no metaplastic epithelium adjacent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Argyrophil cells were present in 90% of biopsies and resections of Barrett's mucosa combined, irrespective of the histological type of metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By immunocytochemistry the most frequently identified substance in mucosal <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells was <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (82%) followed by somatostatin (54%), secretin (22%) and pancreatic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gastrin, bombesin, cholecystokinin, ACTH and substance P were not identified in metaplastic mucosa in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in expression of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> by <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> arising in Barrett's mucosa (31%) and those not (3.8%) was statistically significant (P less than 0.0186) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was demonstrated in 60% of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, both <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> positive and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Focal CEA expression was seen in 4.6% of biopsies and 14% of Barrett's mucosa adjacent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a higher prevalence of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells in Barrett's mucosa than hitherto documented and suggest that <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> may be a useful marker in distinguishing between primary oesophageal and putative <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> at the gastro-oesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The identification of CEA in oesophageal columnar epithelium is of little value in predicting the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
