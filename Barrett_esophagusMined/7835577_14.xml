<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: The inability to precisely measure the area of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> has impaired the study of its natural history and response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study used a novel computer program that creates two-dimensional maps of the esophagus allowing for calculation of the area of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endoscopic photographs of Barrett's models and patients were obtained by independent endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The program transformed the photographs into maps, and the area of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using models, calculated areas correlated with actual areas (r = 0.96) with an overall error of 5.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Color, size, shape, diameter of the model, or endoscopist's experience did not affect the accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accuracy did improve by decreasing the interval between photographs from 4 cm (10.0% error) to 2 cm (4.8% error) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients, area calculations from maps created by independent technicians correlated precisely (r = 0.99) at 1-cm (n = 22) and 2-cm (n = 40) intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent endoscopists correlated precisely in producing photographs for map construction (r = 0.99; n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This novel computer technology produces two-dimensional maps of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> that can be used to accurately calculate area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Minimal interobserver variability in obtaining photographs is found </plain></SENT>
