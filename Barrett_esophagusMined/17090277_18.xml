<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) have the lowest esophageal acid exposure profile compared with the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare lower esophageal acid exposure recordings 1 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) with those 6 cm above the LES as well as to determine the characteristics of esophageal acid exposure along the esophagus among the different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with classic heartburn symptoms were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated by a demographics questionnaire and the validated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> Symptom Checklist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upper endoscopy was performed to evaluate the presence of esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory pH testing was performed using a commercially available 4-sensor pH probe with sensors located 5 cm apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distal sensor was placed 1 cm above the LES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-four patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of those, 21 patients had NERD, 20 had erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (EE), and 23 had BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patient groups demonstrated greater esophageal acid exposure 1 cm above the LES than 6 cm above the LES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In NERD and EE, this phenomenon was primarily a result of a higher mean percentage of upright time with pH &lt;4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unlike patients with EE and BE, those with NERD had very little variation in esophageal acid exposure throughout the esophagus (total and supine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ALL <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> groups demonstrated significant greater esophageal acid exposure at the very distal portion of the esophagus, primarily as a result of short upright reflux events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Unlike erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and BE, NERD patients demonstrate a more homogenous acid distribution along the esophagus </plain></SENT>
