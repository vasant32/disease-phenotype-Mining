<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) increases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total regression of BE is uncommon with medication or laparoscopic fundoplication, and endoscopic techniques to obliterate BE have varied results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the early results of a balloon-based catheter radiofrequency ablation (RFA) system in patients with medically refractory reflux symptoms and biopsy-proven BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of 27 consecutive patients who underwent RFA for BE from March 2005 through January 2007 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed before ablation to document presence of BE and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and at 8 weeks after the RFA to assess the presence of residual BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean patient age was 53.6 +/- 12.5 years; 16 (59%) were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average length of the Barrett segment treated was 4.6 +/- 4.7 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients (7.4%) had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no periprocedural morbidity or at follow-up, no postprocedure <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> or stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the BE was completely replaced with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptoms regressed in 16 patients (60%) with RFA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eleven required an antireflux procedure for persistent symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short-term results show that RFA for BE is safe and achieves 100% replacement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RFA of BE combined with fundoplication may be offered to patients with BE and medically refractory reflux symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Long-term endoscopic surveillance is needed to determine if the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is reduced with this bimodality therapy </plain></SENT>
