<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one-half of them, the CLLE extended up to 30 cm from the incisors (limited group) and in the other half, it reached above this level (extended group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with stricture and limited CLLE had the lesion in the lower third of the esophagus, whereas 6 of 8 with strictures in the extended group had narrowing in the upper third of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two other patients with extended CLLE were seen with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, 3 had <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and the remaining 4 had CLLE without these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three classic histologic types were encountered in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in the extended group there was more of the intestinal type and less of the junctional type of epithelium, the latter being seen mostly in the limited group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extended group had very low lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressures (mean, 7.3 mm Hg) with severe reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The limited group had a higher mean LES pressure (11.2 mm Hg) with less severe reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both groups, LES pressure and reflux improved following effective antireflux operation; some patients who continued to have demonstrable reflux and a lack of improvement in LES pressure despite antireflux operation, the disease progressed, as evidenced by extension of CLLE </plain></SENT>
