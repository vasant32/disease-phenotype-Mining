<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four-quadrant biopsies were obtained from the cardia from 119 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and 64 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gastric surveillance biopsies were obtained in 108 of the Barrett's patients and 58 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly greater prevalence of cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in short-segment Barrett's (10.2%), but not traditional Barrett's (3.3%), compared to control patients (0%) (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic changes were significantly more frequent in the metaplastic epithelium within the esophagus than in the cardia (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly greater prevalence of noncardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> compared to cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was found in each of the three groups of patients; however, the prevalence of noncardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> between short-segment, traditional, and control patients was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was an infrequent finding in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and appears to develop independently from that in the remainder of the stomach </plain></SENT>
