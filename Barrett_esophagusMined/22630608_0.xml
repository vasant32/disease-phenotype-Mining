<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> both in the development and in the advance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the inflammatory infiltration in metaplastic Barrett's epithelium and to explore the association of microscopic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> to healed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Inflammatory infiltration was qualitatively evaluated in well-characterized Barrett's specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>Esophagitis</z:hpo> was healed prior to histological sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate comparative analysis was performed based on BE length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (78 male, mean age 58.3 Â± 13.3 yrs) were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three cases with long segment BE (LSBE) (33.7%) were spotted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory infiltration was mild, moderate, and severe in 35 (35.7%), 54 (55.1%), and 9 (9.1%) specimens, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The samples with moderate/severe inflammatory infiltration were obtained from patients who had more frequently been diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (p = 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (p = 0.019), and previous use of anti-secretory drugs (p = 0.005) were more common in LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory infiltration of Barrett's epithelium was largely moderate despite preceding healing of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPIs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Previous diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> correlated to the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No association of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> to Barrett's length was established </plain></SENT>
