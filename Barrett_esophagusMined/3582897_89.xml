<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The value of endoscopic surveillance biopsy for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One reason is that the available histologic criteria are not adequate to separate patients with lesser degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or predysplastic changes who are at increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and therefore require more frequent surveillance from those patients who are not at increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used flow cytometry and histology to evaluate 317 biopsy specimens from 64 consecutive patients who were in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveillance program for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and 3 additional patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens from 10 patients had aneuploid cells; 9 of these had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, or both, but 1 patient had only specialized metaplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty specimens ahd G2/tetraploid fractions greater than 6%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 came from patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, or were indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had evidence of genomic instability (<z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>) or abnormalities of mucosal proliferation by flow cytometry, even when the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was focal or difficult to recognize histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a small subset of patients with specialized metaplastic epithelium whose specimens were histologically negative or indefinite for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the mucosa had aneuploid cell populations or proliferative abnormalities that were otherwise found only in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional study may prove that this subset of patients merits more frequent endoscopic biopsy surveillance because of an increased risk for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because the abnormalities we have detected by flow cytometry correlate well with the conventional histologic diagnoses of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, they may prove to be a valuable objective adjunct in the diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
