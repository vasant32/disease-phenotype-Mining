<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: In addition to pathologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> into the esophagus in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, increased duodenoesophegeal reflux has been implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of a new bile diversion procedure in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A complete clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, and bioptic evaluation was performed before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides esophageal manometry, 24-hour pH studies and a Bilitec test were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After surgery, gastric emptying of solids, gastric acid secretion, and serum gastrin were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent highly selective vagotomy, antireflux procedure (posterior gastropexy with cardial calibration or fundoplication), and duodenal switch procedure, with a Roux-en-Y anastomosis 60 cm in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Morbidity occurred in 14% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant improvement in symptoms, endoscopic findings, and radiologic evaluation was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lower esophageal sphincter pressure increased significantly (p &lt; 0.0001), as did abdominal length and total length of the sphincter (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of an incompetent sphincter decreased from 87.3% to 20.9% (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three of seven patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed disappearance of this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Serum gastrin and gastric emptying of solids after surgery remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Basal and peak acid output values were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hour pH studies showed a mean value of 24.8% before surgery, which decreased to 4.8% after surgery (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The determination of the percentage time with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> in the esophagus was 23% before surgery; this decreased to 0.7% after surgery (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Late results showed Visick I and II gradation in 90% of the patients and grade III and IV in 10% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This physiologic approach to the surgical treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> produces a permanent decrease of acid secretion (and avoids anastomotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>), decreases significantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> into the esophagus, and abolishes duodenoesophageal reflux permanently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Significant clinical improvement occurs, and dysplastic changes at Barrett's epithelium disappear in almost 50% of the patients </plain></SENT>
