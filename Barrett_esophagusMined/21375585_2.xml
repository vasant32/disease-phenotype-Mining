<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is reported to be infrequent in Asians, with no data from India regarding its prevalence and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the frequency and risk factors of columnar mucosa with or without specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) in Indian patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 278 GERD patients over 2 years underwent gastroscopy and completed a questionnaire for possible BE risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with columnar mucosa on endoscopy underwent four-quadrant biopsy; BE was histologically defined as columnar mucosa with or without SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients without columnar mucosa at endoscopy were considered as controls and compared to patients with BE and those with SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> had columnar mucosa on histology (16.54%); 25 (8.99%) of these had SIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for BE were the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR]: 3.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-8.17) and a history of eructation (OR: 2.28; CI: 1.11-4.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for SIM were age ≥ 45 years (OR: 2.63; CI: 1.03-6.71), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> (OR: 3.95; CI: 1.24-12.56), and a history of eructation (OR: 3.41; CI: 1.19-9.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sex, severity of symptoms, dietary factors, tobacco or alcohol use, and body mass index were not associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median circumferential segment length was 2 (1-10) cm, and the maximal length was 3 (2-11) cm in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BE is not an uncommon finding among Indian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age ≥ 45 years, history of eructation, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> are associated with SIM </plain></SENT>
