<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are few reports examining the histologic features of the associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and their relationship with the esophageal myenteric plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the clinical and pathologic features of 13 cases of pseudoachalasia seen at our institution between 1979 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detailed clinical and radiographic data were obtained from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases available histologic material was reviewed to confirm the presence and type of associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When possible, the relationship of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> to the esophageal myenteric plexus was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In selected cases immunohistochemical stains were performed to further evaluate this relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had clinical, radiographic, and manometric features similar to primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cohort included seven men and six women, age range 24-79 years (median 61 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> included esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> arising in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagogastric junction (n = 7), metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> to the esophagogastric junction (n = 1), breast <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 1), pulmonary small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (n = 1), pleural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100001'>malignant mesothelioma</z:hpo> (n = 1), and mediastinal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of pseudoachalasia was consistent with neoplastic infiltration of the esophageal myenteric plexus in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic cells surrounded myenteric ganglion cells, which appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in number and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the patient with pulmonary small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, there was no evidence of neoplastic infiltration of the esophagogastric junction, and anti-ANNA-1 antibody was detected, suggesting a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030472" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">paraneoplastic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Tissue obtained at the time of esophagomyotomy revealed lymphocytic myenteric <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of ganglion cells identical to that seen in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mechanism pseudoachalasia in the patient with breast <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is uncertain, as there was no evidence of direct involvement of the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In summary, we describe 13 cases of pseudoachalasia resulting in a clinical syndrome indistinguishable from primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The most common mechanism is direct involvement of the esophageal myenteric plexus by neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Rarely, a distant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> may cause this syndrome as a paraneoplastic process </plain></SENT>
