<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Relevant guidelines require that a primary histological diagnosis of high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIEN) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>, be submitted to a second opinion by an expert gastroenterological pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, however, no pertinent study of the outcome of such second-opinion diagnoses has been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2001 and 2005, histological slides from 275 patients with the primary diagnosis HGIEN underwent a second-opinion review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resulting diagnoses were checked by follow-up in 207 of these patients (75.3 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The second-opinion diagnosis no IEN (n = 27) was confirmed in 85.2 % of the cases, 7.4 % had LGIEN, 3.7 % had HGIEN or a well-differentiated Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BCA) (1 patient, each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the single patient with the second-opinion diagnosis LGIEN, endoscopic resection revealed a well-differentiated BCA, Follow-up examinations confirmed the second-opinion diagnosis BCA in 5 out of 12 patients, in 1 patient no IEN was found, and 6 patients had a BCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second-opinion diagnosis BCA was confirmed by follow-up-examinations in 145 patients (86.8 %), in 12 patients (7.2 %) follow-up revealed HGIEN and in 10 no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that the demand for a second opinion from an expert gastroenterological pathologist is justified, and also that BCA is frequently underdiagnosed as HGIEN </plain></SENT>
