<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a condition in which the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, that carries an increased risk for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> and initial stage <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> generally precede this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>; the increased risk has led to attempts at early detection of these lesions through periodic upper endoscopy and biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The continued rise in the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus has fueled resurgent interest in the use of a variety of endoscopic techniques, like <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy, to improve the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and associated complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine if <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy directed biopsies offer advantage over the conventional technique in the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Forty-five patients with previous diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were enrolled in this study; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them underwent upper endoscopy with random biopsies and upper endoscopy with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene-blue</z:chebi> directed biopsies within 4 weeks, in the period between April and October, 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results of histologic examination of random biopsies and those of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> directed biopsies were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 62,5%, 15,4%, 57,7% and 18,2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the total number of biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences were found in the total amount of time spent during each procedure (chromoendoscopy x conventional technique), with chromoendoscopy being significantly longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We concluded that <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy offered no advantage over the conventional method in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
