<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, the expression of the protooncogene c-Ha-ras was studied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from different regions of the gastrointestinal tract in these two diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of c-Ha-ras was greater in proximal than in distal colon and undetectable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These regional differences in expression were not seen with the control gene beta-actin or with the protooncogenes c-myc and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate structural factors contributing to expression, amplification and methylation of c-Ha-ras DNA were studied in these tissues by Southern and slot blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No amplification of c-Ha-ras or six other protooncogenes was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest tissue-specific regulation of c-Ha-ras expression in the gastrointestinal tract in certain premalignant <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
