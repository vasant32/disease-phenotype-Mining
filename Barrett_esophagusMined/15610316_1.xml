<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The majority of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are closely associated with the specialized columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> presenting in short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (SSBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The endoscopic biopsy specimens obtained from 91 patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten were cases of long-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (LSBE) and 81 had SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of MUC2, MUC5AC, Con A and CD10 was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples from LSBE (n = 9) were histologically diagnosed as specialized columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 81 SSBE samples were divided into gastric fundic-type (n = 26), junctional-type (n = 16) and specialized columnar epithelium (n = 39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the specialized columnar epithelium of SSBE, there was a predominance of goblet cell-type <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> proposed by Watanabe et al. which is characterized by MUC2-positive pyloric epithelium (66.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total percentage of non-goblet cell-type and goblet cell-type was 76.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 80% of LSBE revealed the large intestinal-type or the large and small intestinal-type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The long oval and villous pit by magnifying endoscope suggests the presence of the specialized columnar epithelium, but the phenotypic classification of Watanabe's criteria was not associated with the endoscopic pit pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>Intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> changes immunohistochemically with progress of the disease </plain></SENT>
