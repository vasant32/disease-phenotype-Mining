<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is associated with significantly increased risk of development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Replacing columnar epithelium with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous lining in this condition offers the possibility of decreasing the risk of degeneration to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to establish the feasibility of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> beam plasma coagulation (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="28971">ABPC</z:chebi>), in conjunction with control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, to restore the squamous lining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (four low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, three high-grade) were recruited from our surveillance program, and underwent endoscopic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28971">ABPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients completed treatment, with macroscopic replacement of their columnar lining by squamous epithelium, histologically confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 27, and followed up for a median of 9 months (range, 6-18 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patterns of squamous replacement were identified: 70% of patients showed squamous epithelium with no persistent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, and in 30% the new squamous epithelium covered areas of underlying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient has withdrawn from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath>, with one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, occurred early in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28971">ABPC</z:chebi>, in conjunction with control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, allows squamous regrowth in both benign and dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the theoretical safety advantages of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28971">ABPC</z:chebi> over techniques such as laser, esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> may occur with this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is too soon to recommend <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28971">ABPC</z:chebi> for dysplastic or nondysplastic Barrett's because follow-up is too short to show a decreased incidence of and mortality from <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
