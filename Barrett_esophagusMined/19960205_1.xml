<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postoperative paraesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> has an incidence range up to 7% in the immediate postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: A prospective randomized trial was scheduled to study the role of posterior gastropexy, in combination with LNF, in prevention of paraesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> and improvement of postoperative results in surgical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were randomized to LNF combined with (group A, n = 40) or without (group B, n = 42) posterior gastropexy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjective evaluation using disease-specific and generic questionnaires and structured interviews, and objective evaluation by endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24-h pH monitoring, were performed before operation, at 2 and 12 months after surgery, and then every year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Crura approximation was performed by stitches if the diameter was less than 6 cm, or with a patch to reinforce the conventional crural closure or by tension-free technique to close the hiatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Posterior gastropexy (group A) was performed with one stitch between the posterior wall of the wrap and the crura near the arcuate ligament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients of group A and 15 patients of group B with concomitant abdominal diseases had simultaneous procedures [cholecystectomy 25, vagotomy 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002933'>ventral hernia</z:hpo> repair 1, gastric polypectomy 1, gastric fundus diverticulectomy 1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100723'>gastrointestinal stromal tumor</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100723'>GIST</z:hpo>) wedge resection 1] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In mean follow-up of 48 +/- 26 months (range 7-94 months), one patient of group B presented with paraesophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> in the first postoperative month (reoperation), while recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> (Visick III or IV), successfully treated by medication, was noted in three patients of group B and in one patient of group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, during the first two postoperative months, was noted in nine patients of group A and eight patients of group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients of each group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> had endoscopic improvement after the second postoperative month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Visick score in groups A/B was I in 26/11 (P &lt; 0.0001), II in 13/27 (P = 0.037), III in 1/2 (not significant, NS), and IV in 0/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Generally, Visick score was I or II in 39/38 in groups A/B (97.5%/90.5%, NS) and III or IV in 1/4 (2.5%/9.5%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LNF combined with posterior gastropexy may prevent postoperative paraesophageal or sliding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> in surgical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>, providing better early and long-term postoperative results </plain></SENT>
