<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The length of the metaplastic epithelium has been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000351'>increased cell proliferation</z:mp> are early events in the malignant sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and Ki-67 are indirect markers of these complex mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the expression of VEGF, COX-2 and Ki-67 in BE and investigate whether there is an association to Barrett's length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for VEGF, COX-2, and Ki-67 was performed in well-characterized Barrett's samples, evaluated using a qualitative scale and compared between long (LSBE) and short (SSBE) segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population consisted of 98 patients (78 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LSBE and SSBE was diagnosed in 33 (33.7%) and 65 (66.3%) cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VEGF was expressed in vascular endothelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Barrett's specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>COX-2 and Ki-67 expression in metaplastic epithelia was strong in 81.6 and 61.2% of the samples, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 expression was significantly stronger in LSBE (p = 0.035), whereas VEGF expression was significantly increased in SSBE (p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>COX-2 expression was not associated with Barrett's length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VEGF, COX-2, and Ki-67 were overexpressed in the majority of Barrett's samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The length was inversely associated with VEGF expression and directly associated with Ki-67 expression </plain></SENT>
