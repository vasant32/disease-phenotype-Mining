<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively collected data of 399 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) or large paraesophageal/mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication between January 1992 and June 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative workup included symptoms questionnaire, videoesophagogram, upper endoscopy, manometry, and pH-metry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative clinical/functional studies were performed at 1, 6, 12 months, and thereafter every other year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into four groups: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> with nonerosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and large paraesophageal/mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical failures were considered as follows: (1) recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms or abnormal 24-h pH monitoring; (2) recurrence of endoscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>; (3) recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>/slipped fundoplication on endoscopy/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> swallow; (4) postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>; (5) postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of gas <z:mp ids='MP_0009247'>bloating</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty-five patients (87 M:58 F) were operated between January 1992 and June 1999: 80 nonerosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 29 erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and 19 large paraesophageal/mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 97 months, the success rate was 74% for surgery only and 86% for primary surgery and 'complementary' treatments (21 patients: 13 redo surgery and eight endoscopic dilations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> and recurrence of reflux were the most frequent causes of failure for nonerosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients; recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> was prevalent among patients with large paraesophageal/mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gas <z:mp ids='MP_0009247'>bloating</z:mp> (causing failure) was reported by nonerosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> patients only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, 115 patients were off '<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitors</z:chebi>'; 30 were still on medications (eight for causes unrelated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
