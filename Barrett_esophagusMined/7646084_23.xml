<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The stomach can be used either in its entirely or as a greater curvature tube for esophageal replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study compares the gastric tube (group A; n = 112) to the whole stomach whose lesser curvature is denuded (group B; n = 100) in terms of technical complication and alimentary comfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical results are substantiated by assessment of the eating performance of patients and control subjects at a test meal, measurement of the gastric dimensions before and after both tailoring procedures, and intraarterial staining of the gastric wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Major differences between the two groups are cervical anastomosis stenoses (22.3% versus 6% [A versus B]; p = 0.008), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> (7.9% versus 1%; p = 0.0209), number of meals and snacks per day (4.6 versus 4; p = 0.0275), sensation of early fullness at meals (52.4% versus 17.8%; p &lt; 0.0001), ratings given to the long-term alimentary comfort (presymptomatic condition = 10 points) (7.6 versus 8.8 out of 10 on average; p &lt; 0.0001), and calories consumed in 1 minute at a test meal (59% [p &lt; 0.05] versus 77% of those consumed by control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volume of the stomach is reduced by a range of 21.4% to 47.2% after tubulization (group A) whereas it increases by a range of 4.9% to 17.4% after denudation of the lesser curve (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraarterial staining of the gastric wall reveals the poor vascularity of the upper-most segment of the greater curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Slight increase of the gastric capacity and maintenance of the submucosal vascular network account for the better results achieved with the whole stomach </plain></SENT>
