<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amplification of the c-erb-b2 gene was as follows: SE, 0.0%; LGD, 0.0%; HGD, 11.1%; and CA, 13.6%; and protein overexpression was as follows: SE, 0.0%; LGD, 7.4%; HGD, 18.5%; and CA, 21.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 8 (89%) of 9 samples, c-erb-b2 gene amplification correlated with protein overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reverse was true in 8 (47%) of 17 samples: c-erb-b2 protein overexpression was proved with simultaneous gene amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amplification of c-erb-b2 is a late event in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, protein overexpression appears more often and earlier Besides gene amplification, other mechanisms to induce protein overexpression must exist </plain></SENT>
