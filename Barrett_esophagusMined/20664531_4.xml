<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The gold standard for endoscopic surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) includes targeted biopsies (TBs) from abnormalities as well as stepwise four-quadrant biopsies (4QBs) for detection of invisible high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> (HGINs) or early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (ECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a large mixed BE population, we investigated the rate of HGINs/ECs that are macroscopically occult to enhanced visualization with high-resolution endoscopy plus <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2007 to December 2009, 701 consecutive BE patients were enrolled in a prospective study at a tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 406 patients had a history of HGIN/EC (high-risk group) and 295 patients did not (low-risk group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 701 patients, 459 TBs and 5,485 4QBs were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 92 patients with 132 lesions containing HGINs/ECs were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the diagnosis of HGINs/ECs, patient-related sensitivity and specificity rates of endoscopic imaging with TBs were 96.7 and 66.5%, with a positive and negative predictive value of 30.4 and 99.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the high-risk group, 4QBs identified three additional patients (3.3%) with macroscopically occult HGINs/ECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the low-risk group, no HGINs/ECs were identified with either biopsy approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Advanced endoscopic imaging identifies the vast majority of BE patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, and the additive effect of 4QB is minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in low- and high-risk patients, limiting endoscopic surveillance to guided biopsies is justified in specialized high-volume centers with permanent quality control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, we do not advocate abandoning 4QB outside this setting </plain></SENT>
