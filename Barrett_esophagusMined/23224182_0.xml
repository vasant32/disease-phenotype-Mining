<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured 337 Raman spectra (Î»(ex)=830 nm; P(ex)=60 mW; t=1 s) using a confocal probe from fresh (298) and snap-frozen (39) oesophageal tissue collected during surgery or endoscopy from 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spectra were correlated with histopathology and used to construct a multivariate classification model which was tested using leave one tissue site out cross-validation in order to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the probe system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Raman probe system was able to differentiate, when tested with leave one site out cross-validation, between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous oesophagus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> with sensitivities of (838% to 6%) and specificities of (89% to 99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a two group model to differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> demonstrated a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 87% for classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This fiber-optic Raman system can provide rapid, objective, and accurate diagnosis of oesophageal pathology ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The confocal design of this probe enables superficial mucosal abnormalities (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) to be classified in clinically applicable timescales paving the way for an in vivo trial </plain></SENT>
