<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work the diagnoses in the Rotterdam BO cohort on current standards was redefined to obtain more accurate data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in patients who had not undergone standard endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was determined which patient factors present at index endoscopy were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Rotterdam BO cohort comprises <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with &gt; or =3 cm BO, diagnosed at endoscopy between 1973 and 1984 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, only patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> were included (n = 105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were obtained by questionnaires and/or interviews with patients or treating physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate 20-year risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean length of the BO was 7.1 cm (range: 3-15 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> in BO developed in 6/105 (6%) patients, and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) in 5/105 (5%) patients during 1329 patient-years of follow-up, which equals one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> case per 221 patient-years and one HGD case per 266 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 12.7 years, 72 (69%) patients had died; only 4 of them died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> or its treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A longer length of BO was associated with an increased risk of progression to HGD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six of 24 patients who ever had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> progressed to HGD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> 2-16 years after a diagnosis of BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The annual risk of developing HGD or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in patients with long-segment BO is 0.83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is, however, uncommon, even in a cohort of patients with long-segment BO </plain></SENT>
