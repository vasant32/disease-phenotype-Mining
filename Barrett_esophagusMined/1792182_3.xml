<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those changes consisted in the thickening of the muscularis mucosae, the presence of muscle fibres in the lamina propria mucosae, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of the submucosa and sometimes total obliteration of the subepithelial tissues by collagen-rich <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those changes have been connoted as "musculo-fibrous anomaly" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Barrett's mucosa was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 18 specimens with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and in 13 of the remaining 32 specimens with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Musculo-fibrous anomaly of the Barrett's mucosa occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 18 specimens with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and in 10 of the 13 specimens with a concomitantly growing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Esophageal and metaplastic glands were surrounded, compressed and deformed by the fibrotic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histological changes described explain the difficulties in the differential diagnosis--in biopsy specimens--between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glands or glands with dysplastic changes "trapped" in the collagen-rich fibrotic tissue and true invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
