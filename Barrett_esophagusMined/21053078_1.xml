<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: At present, the dilation of esophageal intercellular spaces (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e>) is considered an early morphologic marker of acid damage in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, previous electron microscopic (EM) studies had focused only on the suprabasal layer of squamous epithelium or did not nearly specify which layer of squamous epithelium was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed to assess the volumetric amount of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> layers of SE in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, 48 patients were prospectively included (NERD = 18, ERD = 17; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> = 5, controls = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with ERD and NERD had typical reflux symptoms, as assessed by a valid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> volume was assessed by electron microscopy in the superficial, prickle cell, and basal layers of esophageal squamous epithelium using the method of Weibel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ERD was associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> volume in the basal layer (LA-A, p = 0.038; LA-B, p = 0.005) and prickle cell layer (LA-A, p = 0.006; LA-B, p = 0.007) as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between NERD and ERD patients revealed more dilated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> in the basal layer (LA-B, p = 0.007), prickle cell layer (LA-A, p = 0.008; LA-B, p = 0.001) and superficial layer (LA-B, p = 0.018) in patients with ERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Not only the diameter but also the volume of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> is increased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the dilation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> is present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three layers of the SE, being more pronounced in the basal layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings support the concept that the impairment of the esophagus begins in the deeper parts of the esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
