<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a 60-year-old man with a long history of heartburn and recently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, narrowing of the distal esophagus was found to be related to the presence of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A short time later repeated endoscopy revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent esophagogastrectomy and died a few days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings in the surgical specimen and upon autopsy were consistent with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> of the distal esophagus as well as with intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the data available in the literature reveals that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> of the esophagus, although rare, clearly possesses some definite characteristics of its own </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the presence of these three features in a single patient constitutes no more than a chance coexistence </plain></SENT>
