<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Columnar cell lined lower oesophagus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CELLO</z:e>), often considered to be a precancerous lesion, is characterized by a glandular mucosa with a predominance of sulphomucins in the specialized epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This histochemical abnormality can be correlated with abnormal differentiation which may also be studied by anti-mucus antibodies (anti-M1, anti-M3, anti-SIMA, anti-LIMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this prospective study is to define the mucin profile in a large population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CELLO</z:e> by immunohistochemistry and to compare it with the results of histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsies of 79 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CELLO</z:e> and 41 had a histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six surgical specimens of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histochemical methods confirmed the preponderance (57.9%) of type III <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) found in 57.9% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical methods showed a similar antigenic profile of type II and III IM with positivity of anti-SIMA and anti-M3 antibodies in the goblet cells, and positivity of anti-LIMA antibodies in both the goblet and intermediate cells of the specialized epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mucus secreting cells of the oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> had the same immunohistochemical profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are similar to those of Filipe et al. in type II and III IM surrounding <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical methods allow us to subdivide type II and type III IM into 2 subgroups according to the positivity or negativity of the anti-LIMA antibodies in the intermediate cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the 41 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardias in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e>, 10 contain sulphomucin secreting cells positive with anti-LIMA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this anti-LIMA positivity may be a step preceding type III IM in specialized epithelium </plain></SENT>
