<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The records of 75 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> seen over a four-year period at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were retrospectively reviewed to determine the prevalence of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and to identify clinical, manometric, laboratory, or radiographic criteria that might predict the presence of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of these patients underwent endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this group, the prevalence of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was 37 percent (nine patients) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was also present in two of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with and without Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> were similar in age (range, 22 to 64 compared with 28 to 79, respectively), sex (six of nine compared with 12 of 15 female, respectively), frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal motility disorders</z:e>, presence of proximal skin involvement, digital ulceration, and pulmonary involvement as measured by diffusion capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> was diagnosed on the basis of double-contrast esophagographic results in only one of eight patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> so-studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> tended to have longer duration of heartburn (90 +/- 40 months compared with 11 +/- 35 months) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (39 +/- 22 months compared with 7 +/- 3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> also tended to have greater impairment of lower esophageal sphincter pressure either at end-expiration (4.0 +/- 2.1 compared with 6.1 +/- 1.8 mm Hg) or mid-respiration (13.0 +/- 3.0 compared with 16.9 +/- 2.5 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using chi-square analysis, however, none of these differences reached statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Discrimination did occur on the basis of the presence of the CREST (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003761'>calcinosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e>, esophageal manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011838'>sclerodactyly</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039446" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">telangiectasis</z:e>) variant (55 percent compared with 7 percent, p less than 0.01), a duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> of more than five months (p less than 0.03), and mid-respiratory lower esophageal sphincter pressure of less than 10 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that: Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus occurs in one third of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo>; clinical, manometric, laboratory, and radiographic features are poor predictors of the presence of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>; patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CREST syndrome</z:e>, prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, or a very low lower esophageal sphincter pressure may have an increased risk for the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>; patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> and Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> have an increased risk of complications such as stricture or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
