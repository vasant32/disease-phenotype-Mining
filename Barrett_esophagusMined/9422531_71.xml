<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>E-cadherin is expressed in most epithelia, although it may be co-expressed with P-cadherin in basal layers of stratified epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adhesive function of cadherins relies on interactions with catenins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many reports have characterized reduced expression of cadherins and catenins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, including those of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to characterize expression of E- and P-cadherins, and the catenins, in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis and Western blotting were performed on paraffin-embedded and fresh-frozen tissue using antisera to the selected cadherins and catenins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this study have shown inappropriate expression of cadherins and catenins in neoplastic Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant reduction of E-cadherin expression as the Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence progressed (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, P-cadherin, expressed in basal layers of squamous esophagus, was usually absent from Barrett's and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> but was expressed in 17 of 24 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, especially at the advancing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> edge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of catenins was also seen, but in some specimens, immunoreactivity was observed in neoplastic nuclei, suggesting mediation of a nuclear function such as transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
