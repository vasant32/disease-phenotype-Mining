<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) is a common condition that affects patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The HRQoL of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has been less well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is unknown to what extent BE patients suffer from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> as a result of carrying a diagnosis of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare BE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (stratified by erosive reflux disease (ERD) and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD)) with regard to HRQoL and psychological impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this single-center study of subjects presenting for elective upper endoscopy, consecutive patients with BE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants completed questionnaires assessing generic HRQoL (medical outcomes study short form-36 (SF-36)), disease-specific HRQoL (gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI)), a measure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> (the Revised Hopkins Symptom Checklist: SCL-90R), and a patient-centered assessment of the impact of disease severity (the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> health-related quality of life measure (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> HRQL)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with BE had the lowest symptom severity compared with those suffering from NERD or ERD (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> HRQL: 13.7 vs. 18 and 15.9, respectively, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with BE also had better disease-specific quality of life compared with NERD or ERD patients (GIQLI: 137.2 vs. 124.3 and 131.0, respectively, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for potential confounding variables including symptom severity and gender, BE patients continued to demonstrate better disease-specific HRQoL, scoring 12.2 points higher on the GIQLI than NERD patients (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-19.3) and 16.3 points higher than ERD patients (95% CI 5.4-27.3), as well as better generic HRQoL, scoring 4.8 points higher on the SF-36 physical component summary than NERD patients (95% CI 0.8-8.8) and 7.1 points higher than ERD patients (95% CI 1.2-13.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e>, as demonstrated by the SCL-90R global severity index, although BE patients scored lower on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149779" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">somatization</z:e> domain compared with NERD and ERD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When stratified by gender, females with NERD and BE had worse disease-specific HRQoL than males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BE have better generic and disease-specific HRQoL when compared with patients suffering from NERD and ERD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This difference is only partially attributable to lower symptom severity amongs BE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Psychological distress</z:e> did not differ significantly amongs groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Female gender was associated with worsened HRQoL regardless of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> disease manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Though more precise instruments may aid in detecting any HRQoL decrements in BE patients because of perceived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk or fear of developing or dying from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, we were unable to demonstrate an additional decrement in HRQoL because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in subjects with BE </plain></SENT>
