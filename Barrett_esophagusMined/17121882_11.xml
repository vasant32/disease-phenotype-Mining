<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Reprimo, a candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene, regulates p53-mediated cell cycle arrest at G2 phase, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene methylation is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine whether and at what phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> Reprimo methylation occurs in Barrett's adenocarcinogenesis, as well as its columnar or squamous cell-type specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also sought to determine whether Reprimo expression could be restored in vitro by the demethylating agent 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5AzaC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Quantitative methylation-specific PCR for Reprimo was done using an ABI7700 (Taqman) apparatus on 175 endoscopic biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, reverse transcription-PCR and quantitative methylation-specific PCR were done on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> cells before and after treatment with 5AzaC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE; P=0.001), high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD; P=0.001), and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC; P=0.00003), the level and frequency of Reprimo methylation were significantly higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus (NE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between BE and EAC, HGD and EAC, or NE and esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reprimo methylation occurred in 0 of 19 NE samples, 6 (13%) of 45 ESCC, 9 (36%) of 25 BE, 7 (64%) of 11 HGD, and 47 (63%) of 75 EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of Reprimo methylation in EAC versus NE revealed an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 0.812 (P&lt;0.00001; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro 5AzaC treatment of OE33 EAC cells reduced Reprimo methylation and increased Reprimo expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reprimo methylation occurs significantly more frequently in BE, HGD, and EAC than in NE or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>, suggesting that this epigenetic alteration is a specialized columnar, cell-specific early event with potential as a biomarker for the early detection of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
