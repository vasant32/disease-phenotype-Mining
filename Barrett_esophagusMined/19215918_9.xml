<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The reported yield of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene-blue</z:chebi> (MB) chromoendoscopy targeted biopsy in detecting specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (SIM) and, more importantly, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) has shown variable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To perform a meta-analysis of published studies for assessment of the diagnostic yield of techniques of chromoendoscopy compared with conventional 4-quadrant random biopsy (RB) in detection of SIM and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A literature search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Databases was performed, along with a search of PubMed and a manual search of cross-references of eligible articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on yield of both modalities were extracted and analyzed to estimate weighted incremental yield (IY) and 95% CIs of MB over RB using a fixed-effects or random-effects model, as appropriate, based on whether homogeneity or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, respectively, was indicated by Cochrane's Q chi(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 450 patients with BE were reported in 9 studies included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant IY with MB over RB for detection of SIM (IY 4%; 95% CI, -7% to 16%; 6 studies, n = 251), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (IY 9%; 95% CI, -1% to 20%; 9 studies, n = 450), and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and/or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (IY 5%; 95% CI, -1% to 10%; 8 studies, n = 405) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Only data on MB were analyzed because of limited availability of data for other chromoendoscopy dyes, minor variations in inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the small sample size, and because differences in application technique could have led to an underestimation of the diagnostic yield of MB chromoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The technique of MB chromoendoscopy has only a comparable yield with RB for the detection of SIM and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> during endoscopic evaluation of patients with BE </plain></SENT>
