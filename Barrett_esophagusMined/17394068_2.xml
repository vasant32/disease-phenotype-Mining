<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize histochemically the esophageal SMGs and a primary culture obtained from these glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissues and cultures were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi> Schiff, Alcian blue, lectins, or cytokeratins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the perfused esophagus, addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi> increased mucin secretion by approximately 2-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that [1] a method for culturing SMG cells was developed; [2] conventional staining indicates the presence of sulfated, acidic, and neutral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37395">mucopolysaccharides</z:chebi> in glands and cultures; [3] lectin binding indicates the presence of N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi>, N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7539">neuraminic acid</z:chebi>, N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28328">galactosamine</z:chebi>, and alpha-L: -<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33984">fucose</z:chebi> in mucous cells and cultures; [4] cytokeratin and lectin staining indicated similarities with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1258085" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Barrett epithelium</z:e> (columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus); and [5] <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38324">cholinergic agonists</z:chebi> enhance mucin secretion and this could play a significant role in esophageal protection </plain></SENT>
