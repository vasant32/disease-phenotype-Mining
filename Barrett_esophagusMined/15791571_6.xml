<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined 23 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> (2 with long segment and 21 with short segment) endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After staining with Lugol's <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> solution, squamous islands were identified in the columnar mucosa in 18 (78%) of the 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When biopsy specimens were obtained from these islands, esophageal glands proper or their ducts were seen in 12 (67%) of the 18 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the identification of esophageal glands proper is a definite indicator that a piece of biopsy tissue is of esophageal origin, a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> could be made purely on the basis of the histological findings in these biopsy specimens of squamous islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was the case in 12 (52%) of the 23 patients examined in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staining with Lugol's <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> solution, with subsequent biopsy of stained squamous islands, may assist in the diagnosis of short-segment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also conclude, on the basis of our study, that columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the esophagus cannot develop by direct outgrowth of epithelium from the ducts of esophageal glands proper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> was not always observed in the columnar mucosa around the duct orifices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From a practical point of view, biopsy specimens from columnar-lined mucosa of the esophagus do not always show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
