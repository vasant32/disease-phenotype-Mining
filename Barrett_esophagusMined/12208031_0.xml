<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to acquire detailed knowledge on the pharmacokinetics of ALA and the photosensitizer protoporphyin IX (PPIX) in tissues and plasma of patients with BE to provide a rationale for the conditions used in ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 26 patients with BE were randomized to varying time intervals between ingesting 60 mg/kg ALA and undergoing an endoscopy with biopsies of BE, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal and gastric mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 1, 2, 7, 8 and 24 h, two patients at each time, and at 3, 4, 5 and 6 h, four patients at each time after ALA ingestion were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ALA, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> intermediates and PPIX were determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy and plasma samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum concentration of PPIX was found earlier in BE (4.6+/-0.5 h) than in squamous epithelium (SQ) (6.6+/-2.2 h) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PPIX concentrations were higher in SQ than in BE especially at longer time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, tissue ALA concentrations were found to be 20-fold higher than the plasma concentrations at 1 h after ALA ingestion, suggesting uptake from the oesophageal lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000992'>Skin photosensitivity</z:hpo> was short-lasting but often debilitating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results provide a rationale for the use of ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> for the treatment of BE at 4-5 h after ALA ingestion and for local application of ALA in the oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> must be strongly advised to avoid sunlight for at least 24-36 h </plain></SENT>
