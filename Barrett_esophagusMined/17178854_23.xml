<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The precursor metaplastic mucosal lesion that predisposes for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the signal transduction events that occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are poorly understood, this study aimed at generating a comprehensive description of cellular kinase activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous esophagus, and gastric cardia to gain more insight into the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> arrays, exhibiting 1,176 specific consensus sequences for protein kinases, were used to produce a global analysis of cellular kinase activity in biopsies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and results were compared with the neighboring cardia and squamous epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several differences in kinase activity using immunoblot analysis and enzyme activity assays were validated in biopsies of 27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three unique kinome profiles are described and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified cascades of activated kinases showing that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase and epidermal growth factor receptor activity are both significantly altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> compared with squamous and gastric cardia epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another novel finding is that the glycolysis pathway is significantly up-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, which is illustrated by an up-regulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, the unique kinome profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is made available as a comprehensive database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several signaling pathways are revealed as specifically expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> when compared with the adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These unique findings provide novel insight in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> that will ultimately help to resolve the increasing problem of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and prevention of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
