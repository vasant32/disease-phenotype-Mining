<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the existence of uncommitted, slowly cycling cells by tracking 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (IdU) label-retaining cells (LRCs) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophagus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), <z:mp ids='MP_0000467'>esophageal dysplasia</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and healthy stomach tissues from patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients (3 undergoing esophagectomy, 1 undergoing esophageal endoscopic mucosal resection for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and an esophagectomy for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) received intravenous infusion of IdU (200 mg/m(2) body surface area; maximum dose, 400 mg) over a 30-minute period; the IdU had a circulation half-life of 8 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissues were collected at 7, 11, 29, and 67 days after infusion, from regions of healthy esophagus, BE, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and healthy stomach; they were analyzed by in situ hybridization, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No LRCs were found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, but there were significant numbers of LRCs in the base of glands from BE tissue, in the papillae of the basal layer of the esophageal squamous epithelium, and in the neck/isthmus region of healthy stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cells cycled slowly because IdU was retained for at least 67 days and co-labeling with Ki-67 was infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In glands from BE tissues, most cells did not express defensin-5, Muc-2, or chromogranin A, indicating that they were not lineage committed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some cells labeled for <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> markers and IdU at 67 days; these cells represented a small population (&lt;0.1%) of epithelial cells at this time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The epithelial turnover time of the healthy esophageal mucosa was approximately 11 days (twice that of the intestine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LRCs of human esophagus and stomach have many features of stem cells (long lived, slow cycling, uncommitted, and multipotent), and can be found in a recognized stem cell niche </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further analyses of these cells, in healthy and metaplastic epithelia, is required </plain></SENT>
