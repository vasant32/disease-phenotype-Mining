<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are variations in surveillance practice, clinical outcomes and economic analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study examined long-term survival and financial impact in patients undergoing annual surveillance of BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with BM and considered fit for curative treatment between January 1994 and July 2001 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surveillance was scheduled as annual endoscopy with quadrantic biopsies every 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Financial analysis was based on standard National Health Service costs to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or follow-up to 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison was made with patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> over the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred and two patients were identified with BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Minimum follow-up was 5 years with a total follow-up of 654 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed HGD and six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median time between last nondysplastic biopsy and development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> or HGD was 16 months (range 9-55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five underwent potentially curative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients were unfit (n=1), refused surgery (n=1) or had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four of five treated patients survived up to 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The total cost of the surveillance programme including subsequent surgical or palliative treatment was euro240 682, euro30 085 per patient who progressed and for the prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> group (n=74) euro630 480 or euro8520 per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only two patients in this group survived beyond 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The additional cost of surveillance was euro4493 per life year gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A surveillance programme leads to improved 5-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is cost-effective compared with dealing with unselected patients </plain></SENT>
