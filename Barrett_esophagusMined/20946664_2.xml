<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) might play a role during the multistep carcinogenetic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of MMP-1 and -13 was analyzed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> (n = 41 EAC with BE, n = 19 EAC without BE, and n = 10 esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinomas</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>), furthermore in BE without intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (IN) (n = 18), and the cell line OE-33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MMP-1 was co-labelled with Ki-67 (proliferation), Cdx-2 (marker for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, BE) and analyzed on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MMP-1 staining results were correlated with clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On protein level, MMP-1 expression was found in 39 of 41 (95%) EAC with BE, in 19 of 19 (100%) EAC without BE, in 6 of 10 (60%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>, and in 10 of 18 (56%) BE without IN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No expression of MMP-13 was found in these specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantification showed 48% MMP-1 positive cells in EAC with BE, compared to 35% in adjacent BE (p &lt; 0.05), 44% in EAC without BE, 32% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>, and 4% in BE without IN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence double staining experiments revealed increased MMP-1 expressing in proliferating cells (MMP-1+/Ki-67+) (r = 0.943 for BE and r = 0.811 for EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-level, expression of MMP-1 was significantly higher in EAC compared to BE (p = 0.01) and confirmed immunohistochemical staining results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High MMP-1 levels were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> but not with poorer survival (p = 0.307) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that MMP-1 plays a role as preinvasive factor in BE-associated EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Expression of MMP-1 in proliferating BE and EAC cells suggest malignant proliferation following the clonal expansion model </plain></SENT>
