<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Curcuma aromatica, an herbal medicine, has been shown to display anti-carcinogenic properties in a wide variety of cell lines and animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the ability of Curcuma aromatica oil for the prevention of BE and EAC, possibly through its ability to preserve MnSOD function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EDA was performed on rats and Curcuma aromatica oil was administered by i.p. injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological changes and oxidative damage were determined after EDA of 1, 3, and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MnSOD protein level and MnSOD enzymatic activity were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation was determined by TBARs assay and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine for DNA oxidative damage was measured by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the indexes of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and proliferation were determined by PCNA staining and TUNEL assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> were seen in EDA rats, and morphological transformation within the esophageal epithelium was observed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and EAC identified after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The EDA rats treated with Curcuma aromatica oil showed that both MnSOD enzymatic activity and protein level were similar to sham controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decreased incidences of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and EAC also were observed in the EDA rats with Curcuma aromatica oil treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Curcuma aromatica oil prevented loss of MnSOD in EDA rat esophageal epithelium, and this preservation of MnSOD is associated with the potential protective mechanism against transformation of esophageal epithelial to BE to EAC </plain></SENT>
