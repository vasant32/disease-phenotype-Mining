<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the wide range of probes commercially available for interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), the supply of locus-specific probes is limited to genes or chromosomal regions commonly altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> or during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Generation of these probes is therefore desirable to accommodate individual research requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, we detail the methodology required to design and produce custom locus-specific interphase FISH probes for any human genomic region of interest and their application was illustrated in cytogenetic investigations of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumourigenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously utilising FISH, we observed that Barrett's tissues demonstrated chromosome 4 hyperploidy [Gut 52 (2003) 623], but as centromeric probes were used in this analysis, it was not known if the whole chromosome was amplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We consequently generated single-copy sequence probes for the 4p16.3 and 4q35.1 subtelomeric loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multicolour FISH was subsequently performed on interphase preparations originating from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at varying histological grades, thus demonstrating the whole region of chromosome 4 was amplified within the tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, probes for the DNA methyltransferase genes were produced to determine if gene dosage alterations were responsible for increasing methylation activity during Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant alterations at the DNMT1 and DNMT3a loci were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increased copy number of these genes is therefore not the basis for the hypermethylation commonly observed in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
