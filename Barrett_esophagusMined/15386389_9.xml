<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GRB7 is localized in close proximity to the ERBB2 gene within an amplicon previously identified in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated gene amplification and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of GRB7 and ERBB2 in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and its associated precursor lesions to assess their possible role in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Copy number and expression levels were analyzed by Q-PCR (GRB7, ERBB2) and QRT-PCR (GRB7, ERBB2) using TaqMan technology and fluorescence in situ hybridization (ERBB2) in a series of 24 laser-microdissected samples of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and 32 samples of associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parallel analysis of gene copy number changes and expression levels demonstrated that GRB7 and ERBB2 displayed concomitant elevated expression levels and increased copy numbers in 32% of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between GRB7 and ERBB2 in BCA at the DNA level (r(s) = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001) and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level (r(s) = 0.89, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, coamplification (r(s) = 0.97, p &lt; 0.001) and coexpression (r(s) = 0.81, p &lt; 0.001) of GRB7 and ERBB2 are shown to be already present in a subset of BCA associated high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (HGIN), possibly reflecting a role of a concerted expression of GRB7 and ERBB2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No alterations, neither gene amplification nor overexpression were detected in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> associated low grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (LGIN), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) and squamous epithelium, indicating that alterations of GRB7 and ERBB2 are late events in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings may be of particular interest because the transition from high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is a crucial step in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and might underline the putative role of GRB7 and ERBB2 in cell migration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion </plain></SENT>
