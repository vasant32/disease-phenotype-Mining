<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A narrow band imaging (NBI) endoscopy system has been developed that allows superficial surface imaging of esophageal tissue in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the potential of NBI for prediction of histology during screening and surveillance endoscopy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Veterans Affairs Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Fifty-one patients with known or suspected BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NBI images were graded according to mucosal pattern (ridge/villous, circular and irregular/distorted) and vascular pattern (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal), and correlated with histology in a prospective, blinded manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Biopsy-confirmed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were used as the outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 51 patients (mean BE length 3.5 cm), 28 had IM without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 8 had low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD), 7 had high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD), and 8 had cardiac-type mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of ridge/villous pattern for diagnosis of IM without HGD were 93.5%, 86.7%, and 94.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of irregular/distorted pattern for HGD were 100%, 98.7%, and 95.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If biopsies were limited to areas with irregular/distorted pattern, no patient with HGD would have been missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, NBI was unable to distinguish areas of IM from those with LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The open study design without a control group was the main limitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NBI is a novel diagnostic tool with a high degree of accuracy for the detection of metaplastic and dysplastic tissue within the BE segment </plain></SENT>
