<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) can serve as a useful adjunct imaging modality for targeted endoscopic biopsies during surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, CLE may also have potential roles during therapeutic procedures that include localization of pathology, targeting of resections, guiding which therapy to use, and determining adequacy of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case series illustrates a range of cases in which endomicroscopy was performed during the procedure and offers possibilities of real-time decision-making to select specific therapies in patients with known high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the setting of BE presented for endoscopic treatment or follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE with HGD and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> presented for management for initial treatment or follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examinations were performed sequentially with detailed white light endoscopy, narrow band imaging (NBI), <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>, and CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective case series describing the characteristics of the exam findings and illustrating the role of endomicroscopy on real-time case management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with Barrett-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> underwent endomicroscopy as part of their endoscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CLE confirmed findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> seen with red flag techniques such as NBI, and in one case independently suggested findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the majority of cases, these findings were incorporated into the decision of which modality of treatment was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future prospective studies should be done to validate the role of endomicroscopy in BE </plain></SENT>
