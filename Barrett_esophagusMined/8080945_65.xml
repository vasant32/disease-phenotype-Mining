<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the United States, the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus, including the esophagogastric (EG) junction, has been increasing rapidly over the past two decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Except for an association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, little is known about the etiology of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A population-based case-control interview study of 174 White men with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and 750 controls living in three areas of the United States offered the opportunity to investigate the relationship of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with smoking, alcohol drinking, socioeconomic factors, and history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were significantly elevated risks for men who smoked cigarettes (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1) or drank liquor (OR = 1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For both cigarette smoking and liquor drinking, there were significant dose gradients with amount consumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No reduction in risk was observed following smoking cessation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects who switched from nonfilter to filter cigarettes experienced half the risk of those who only smoked nonfilter cigarettes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inverse risk gradients were seen with increasing recent annual income, with the highest risk (OR = 3.4) for the lowest category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk for a history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> (OR = 1.7), especially of the duodenum (OR = 2.2), was also significantly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that tobacco and alcohol may be etiologic factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and EG junction, but these factors do not appear to explain the rapid rise in incidence of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The associations with low social class and history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> need to be explored in greater detail along with other factors that may account for the temporal trends in esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
