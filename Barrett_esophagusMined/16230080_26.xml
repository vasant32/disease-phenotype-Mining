<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The metaplastic process in which the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus is replaced by columnar-lined epithelium, known as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to define, analyze, and compare transcription profiles of BE, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardia epithelium, and squamous epithelium to gain more insight into the process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and to identify uniquely expressed genes in these epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial analysis of gene expression was applied for obtaining transcription libraries of biopsy specimens taken from a BE-affected patient with intestinal type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous and gastric cardia epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Validation of results by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting was performed using tissues of 20 patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: More than 120,000 tags were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between BE and squamous 776, and between BE and gastric cardia 534 tags were significantly differentially expressed (P &lt; .05, pairwise comparison) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, squamous compared with gastric cardia epithelia showed significant differential expression of 1316 tags </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most up-regulated genes in BE compared with squamous epithelium were trefoil factors, annexin A10, and galectin-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each of the epithelia showed a unique cytokeratin expression profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comparison of the transcriptomes of BE, squamous epithelium, and gastric cardia epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BE proves to be an incompletely differentiated type of epithelium that shows similarities to both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous and gastric cardia epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, several uniquely expressed genes are identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results are a major advancement in understanding the process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> that leads to BE </plain></SENT>
