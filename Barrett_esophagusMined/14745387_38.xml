<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A novel endoscopic full-thickness plication device has been designed to inhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> by placing a transmural plication near the gastroesophageal junction under direct endoscopic visualization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the safety and efficacy of endoscopic full-thickness plication in the treatment of patients with symptoms caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> heartburn requiring maintenance therapy with antisecretory medication were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were the following: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (&gt;2 cm), grade III and IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following were assessed over a follow-up period of 6 months: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-Health-Related Quality of Life, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, and SF-36 Health Survey, medication use, 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring and esophageal manometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a single, full-thickness plication in the gastric cardia just distal to the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Re-treatment was not permitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 64 patients (mean age 46.3 years, range 23-71 years) underwent endoscopic full-thickness plication (mean procedure time 17.2 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 6 months after plication, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy had been eliminated in 74% of previously medication-dependent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>-Health-Related Quality of Life scores improved 67% (19.0 vs. 5.0; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improvements also were observed in median Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and SF-36 Health Survey mental and physical composite scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median esophageal acid exposure improved significantly (10 vs. 8; p&lt;0.008) with normalization of pH noted in 30% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant change in esophageal manometry was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> occurred and was managed conservatively without sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a single full-thickness plication placed at the gastroesophageal junction reduced symptoms, medication use, and esophageal acid exposure associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
