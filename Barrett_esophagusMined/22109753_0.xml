<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the true prevalence and severity of reflux disease is not well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this group of patients, the objectives of our study were to determine the prevalence and severity of esophageal acid exposure and classify the endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight patients with extraesophageal symptoms underwent 48 hours of Bravo pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percent of time that pH was &lt;4 (total upright and supine) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severity of reflux was categorized by the percent of total time pH was &lt;4, with mild = &gt;4.2% but &lt;10%, moderate = 10% to 20%, and severe&gt;20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 104/128 (81%) patients who had abnormal esophageal acid exposure, 44% in the upright and supine position, 38% in the upright position only, and 18% in the supine position only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 59/128 (46%) patients with mild reflux, 40/128 (31%) with moderate, and only 5/128 (4%) patients with severe reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>23/128 (18%) patients had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 1/128 (0.8%) patients had pathologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of abnormal esophageal acid exposure was similar in those with (75%) or without (66%) concomitant heartburn and/or regurgitation (P = .3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal esophageal pH is common in patients with extraesophageal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Most have only mild (46%) to moderate (31%) reflux with a low prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (18%) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The degree of esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> cannot be predicted from baseline presence or absence of typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
