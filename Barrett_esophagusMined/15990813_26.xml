<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lower reimbursements for endoscopic procedures and increasing demand for screening endoscopy over the past decade have spurred efforts to increase efficiency in the performance of endoscopic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two dichotomous approaches have emerged: (1) unsedated endoscopy and (2) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to determine national practice patterns of unsedated endoscopy and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> sedation, and to assess endoscopists' attitudes toward unsedated screening with an electronic survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A short survey was developed and then was converted to a Web-based format </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> national members of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) were invited via electronic mail (e-mail) to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survey data were collected electronically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two e-mails elicited responses to the Web survey from 18% (724) of national ASGE members contacted, within 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the respondents, 45% do not routinely offer unsedated EGD and colonoscopy, and only 15% of those respondents plan to incorporate unsedated endoscopy into their practice in the next year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 55% who currently perform unsedated endoscopy, 85% do no more than 25 unsedated procedures per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lack of patient acceptance was the most common reason cited for not offering unsedated endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most endoscopists felt that the availability of unsedated esophagoscopy or colonoscopy would not significantly increase screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Routine use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> sedation for EGD, colonoscopy, and ERCP/EUS was reported by 19%, 22%, and 19%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Community practitioners were more likely to use <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> than those at academic centers (p &lt; 0.0002 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of those not currently using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>, 43% plan to incorporate it into their practice within the next year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Over 70% of respondents would themselves choose to be sedated for routine endoscopic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electronic surveys allow for rapid distribution and data collection but suffer from a limited response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The survey suggests that unsedated endoscopy has limited acceptance in the United States, and, without a major intervention that affects endoscopists' attitudes, its use is not likely to increase significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Unsedated endoscopy will not have a great impact on endoscopic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> sedation has already gained acceptance in the community, and the routine use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> in endoscopy units will likely increase in the future </plain></SENT>
