<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Specialised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and its dysplastic transformation, which precedes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> cannot be differentiated in standard gastroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether laser induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX fluorescence permits the detection of specialised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> during endoscopy and to take biopsy specimens in a guided rather than random manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 53 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> 5-aminolaevulinic acid was sprayed on the mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Approximately 60 to 120 minutes later, biopsy specimens were taken based on point-like measurements of delayed fluorescence intensity ratios of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two independent pathologists examined the 596 biopsy specimens taken, 168 of which were selected to be investigated by a third pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these specimens only those (n=141) with a consensus diagnosis by at least two pathologists and p53 expression as additional marker were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median of normalised fluorescence intensity (ratio of delayed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> fluorescence intensity to immediate autofluorescence intensity) in non-dysplastic specialised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (0.51, 68% CI 0.09 to 1.92) and low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (1.89, 68% CI 0.55 to 3.92) differed significantly (p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was detected at a rate 2.8-fold higher compared with screening endoscopy despite taking fewer specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, three early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were detected for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this method permitted differentiation of specialised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> from junctional or gastric-fundic type epithelium (p&lt;0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For the first time it was possible to differentiate low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from non-dysplastic Barrett's mucosa during endoscopy based on delayed laser induced fluorescence endoscopy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the method helps to detect specialised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in short <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
