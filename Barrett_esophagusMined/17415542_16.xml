<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanisms of initiation and development of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> remain unknown, but a hypothesis of "successful adaptation" against noxious reflux components has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To search for the repertoire of adaptation mechanisms of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, we employed high-throughput functional genomic and proteomic methods that defined the molecular background of metaplastic mucosa resistance to reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional profiling was established for 23 pairs of esophageal squamous epithelium and Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> tissue samples using Affymetrix U133A 2.0 GeneChips and validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in protein composition were assessed by electrophoretic and mass-spectrometry-based methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 2,822 genes differentially expressed between Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and squamous epithelium, we observed significantly overexpressed metaplastic mucosa genes that encode cytokines and growth factors, constituents of extracellular matrix, basement membrane and tight junctions, and proteins involved in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> and phosphoinositol metabolism, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production, and bioenergetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their expression likely reflects defense and repair responses of metaplastic mucosa, whereas overexpression of genes encoding heat shock proteins and several protein kinases in squamous epithelium may reflect lower resistance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium than Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to reflux components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the methodological and interpretative difficulties in data analyses discussed in this paper, our studies confirm that Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> may be regarded as a specific microevolution allowing for accumulation of mucosal morphological and physiological changes that better protect against reflux injury </plain></SENT>
