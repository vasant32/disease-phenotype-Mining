<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of exisulind (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">sulindac</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35850">sulfone</z:chebi>) and a potent derivative CP248 on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE)-related <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines Seg-1 and Bic-1, and on HCE7 esophageal squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marked growth inhibition and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines with IC50 values of 100-300 microM for exisulind and 100 nM for CP248 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bic-1 and HCE7 cells were more sensitive to the growth inhibitory properties of exisulind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines with CP248 for 24 h increased the proportion of cells in mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exisulind had no effect on cell-cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with either compound induced rapid activation of the c-Jun <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), suggesting that JNK1 activation plays a role in the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by these compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only Seg-1 cells expressed a detectable basal level of cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), providing further evidence that cox-2 is not the critical target for the growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of these compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cellular levels of reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) increased approximately five-fold in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines after 24 h of treatment with either compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies provide support for the use of exisulind in BE chemoprevention trials, and of exisulind or CP248 in the therapy of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
