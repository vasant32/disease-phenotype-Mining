<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Late follow-up considered subjective and objective parameters, and related outcome to the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 164 patients were randomized to fundoplication (n = 76) or calibration of the cardia (n = 88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were evaluated by clinical questionnaire, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies, oesophageal manometry and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> studies, including scintigraphy and 24-h oesophageal pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was 95 per cent follow-up at a mean of 85 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean recurrence rate for both operations was near 40 per cent at 10 years, but patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> had a recurrence rate after both operations of around 23 per cent compared with 83 per cent after 10 years for those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> developed in 13 per cent of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> objective parameters in a comparison of patients with Visick I or II and those with Visick III or IV disease at the late assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both total fundoplication and calibration of the cardia with posterior gastropexy had similar subjective and objective late results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, results were significantly worse in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
