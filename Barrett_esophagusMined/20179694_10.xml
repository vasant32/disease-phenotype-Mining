<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Patients with Barrett's high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or early esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) that is shown on biopsy alone continue to undergo esophagectomy without more definitive histological staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic resection (ER) may provide more accurate histological grading and local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (T) staging, definitive therapy, and complete Barrett's excision (CBE); however, long-term outcome data are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to demonstrate the effect on histological grade or local T stage, efficacy, safety and long-term outcome of ER for Barrett's HGD/EAC and of CBE in suitable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective study at two Australian academic hospitals involved 75 consecutive patients over 7 years undergoing ER for biopsy-proven HGD or EAC, using multiband mucosectomy or cap technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, CBE by 2-3-stage radical mucosectomy was attempted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Barrett's segments&lt;or=3 cm in length in patients aged&lt;75 years with minimal comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biopsy histology showed HGD in 89% of patients and EAC in 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, ER histology resulted in altered grading or staging in 48% of patients (down 28%, up 20%), with HGD in 53%, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) in 19%, mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 13%, submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in 9%, and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 4% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CBE success rate was 94% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications were one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (hospitalization with full recovery) and six strictures successfully dilated endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the mean follow-up of 31 months (range 3-89), there was no recurrence at ER sites, 11% developed metachronous lesions and five patients underwent esophagectomy for ER-demonstrated submucosal invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Esophagectomy specimens were T0N0M0 in three and T1N0M0 in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ER alters histological grade or local T stage in 48% of patients and dramatically reduces esophagectomy rates by providing safe and effective therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ER has a high success rate (94%) for CBE in short segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
