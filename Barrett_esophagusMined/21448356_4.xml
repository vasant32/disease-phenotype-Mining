<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to measure miR-200, ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of miR-200 targets was used to predict biological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Barrett's epithelium expressed lower levels of miR-141 and miR-200c than did gastric and duodenal epithelia (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In silico analysis indicated roles for the miR-200 family in molecular pathways that distinguish Barrett's epithelium from gastric and duodenal epithelia, and which control <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> miR-200 members were downregulated in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.02), and miR-200c expression was also downregulated in non-invasive epithelium adjacent to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> miR-200 members was lower in Barrett's epithelium derived high-grade dysplastic cell lines than in a cell line derived from benign Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed significant inverse correlations between miR-200 family expression and ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression in Barrett's epithelium and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: miR-200 expression might contribute to the anti-apoptotic and proliferative phenotype of Barrett's epithelium and regulate key <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027671" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic processes</z:e> in this epithelium </plain></SENT>
