<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Flexible endoscopy is a vital component of gastrointestinal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has and will replace many of the surgical procedures now commonly performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flexible endoscopy, unfortunately, is not an integral part of surgical residency training based on resident operative experience as reported by the Residency Review Committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, general surgeons have deferred the practice of flexible endoscopy to the gastroenterologists because of concerns over turf battles and referral patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the overall case load and the economic impact of flexible endoscopy on the practice of general surgery in a community hospital setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective review was performed over a 6-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total cases and the total billings of inpatient and outpatient procedures for a group practice of five general surgeons in a community hospital were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The billings were the actual charges based on current procedural terminology (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>) codes for these procedures using the Medicare fee schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 2,159 procedures performed, 1,154 involved flexible endoscopy cases accounting for 54% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (1,154 of 2,159) performed from February 1, 2003 to July 31, 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flexible endocopy accounted for 43% of the total charges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A. total of 46 surgical procedures and 216 future endoscopies were generated from the flexible endoscopic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future endoscopic cases were for surveillance of colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Flexible endoscopy contributed to a major portion of the caseload and revenue generated by the general surgery group studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall impact of flexible endoscopy is even greater than reported because of the future endoscopic surveillance cases or surgical interventions generated on the basis of endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
