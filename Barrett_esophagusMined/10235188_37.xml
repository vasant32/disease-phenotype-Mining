<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A number of case reports describe multiple family members with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and Barrett' s esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The wider importance of familial factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have studied the prevalence of reflux symptoms and medication use among relatives of patients with documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A postal questionnaire study of the first degree relatives of six groups of matched patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The groups comprised patients with 1) no dyspeptic symptoms; 2) reflux symptoms and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pH study; 3) reflux symptoms, an abnormal pH study, and a lower esophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure more than 10 mm Hg; 4) reflux symptoms, an abnormal pH study, and a LOS pressure less than 10 mm Hg; 5) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; and 6) peptic stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred eighteen subjects replied (78% response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infrequent reflux symptoms were equally common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequent reflux symptoms, however, were more common among relatives of patients with an abnormal pH study and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (26%, p = 0.007) or low LOS pressure (27%, p = 0.01) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (30%, p = 0.003), compared with relatives of nondyspeptic patients (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequent reflux symptoms were no more common among relatives of patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pH study (16%) or peptic stricture (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reflux medication use showed a similar pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Familial clustering of reflux symptoms is seen in relatives of patients with reflux symptoms and increased esophageal acid exposure and in relatives of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
