<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> is a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal motor disorder</z:e> of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different evidences have been reported in support of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> as the result of an autoimmune and inflammatory process leading to neuronal cell loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to this, idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> has been significantly associated with specific alleles of the human leukocyte antigen system class II, although few reports studying association with other loci can be found in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown association of a non-synonymous polymorphism within the IL23R gene with different <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess whether the IL23R coding variant Arg381Gln polymorphism is involved in susceptibility to idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a case-control study including 262 patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> and 802 healthy subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them white Spaniards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>Achalasia</z:hpo> patients were diagnosed on the basis of clinical, radiographic, endoscopic, and manometric criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples were genotyped for the IL23R Arg381Gln polymorphism using TaqMan technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: The minor allele of the Arg381Gln polymorphism was significantly increased in patients compared with healthy controls (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.01-2.11, P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association seems to be specific to male patients with disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> after 40 years (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.29-4.16, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS &amp; INFERENCES: Our results suggest a role of IL23R in idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> predisposition and extend the evidence of the general influence of this gene in autoimmune and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
