<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to maximize accession of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in this preliminary study, the broad definition of columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> of the lower oesophagus was utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, of 18 cases identified in the 21-year period, 14/17 cases (82%) available for review had specialized columnar epithelium diagnostic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was male predominance 5:1, the mean age was 53.8 years and there were two associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data confirm the occurrence but low prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> in this population but with a disease pattern that is consistent with that reported in other populations, warranting systematic evaluation of the gastro-oesophageal junction even in a Caribbean population </plain></SENT>
