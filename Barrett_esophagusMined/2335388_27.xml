<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the cases, 18 (60%) were non-smokers and 14 (47%) non-drinkers, the corresponding proportions in the controls being 52% and 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, there was no apparent relation between tobacco, alcohol and the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus, the age- and sex-adjusted point estimates being 1.0 for moderate and 0.9 for heavy smokers, 0.7 and 1.5 respectively for moderate and heavy drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upper 95% confidence limits were 1.6 for ever-use of tobacco and 1.9 for ever alcohol drinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study, although based on a limited number of cases, indicate that alcohol and tobacco are unlikely to play a major role in the aetiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
