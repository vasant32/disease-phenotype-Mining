<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single-cell studies have attracted significant interest in recent years and spurred the development of a variety of commercially available and research-grade technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To quantify cell-to-cell variability of cell populations, we have developed an experimental platform for real-time measurements of oxygen consumption (OC) kinetics at the single-cell level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unique challenges inherent to these single-cell measurements arise, and no existing data analysis methodology is available to address them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we present a data processing and analysis method that addresses challenges encountered with this unique type of data in order to extract biologically relevant information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We applied the method to analyze OC profiles obtained with single cells of two different cell lines derived from metaplastic and dysplastic human Barrett's esophageal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In terms of method development, three main challenges were considered for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> dynamic system: (i) high levels of noise, (ii) the lack of a priori knowledge of single-cell dynamics, and (iii) the role of intercellular variability within and across cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several strategies and solutions to address each of these three challenges are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The features such as slopes, intercepts, breakpoint or change-point were extracted for every OC profile and compared across individual cells and cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the extracted features facilitated exposition of subtle differences between individual cells and their responses to cell-cell interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With minor modifications, this method can be used to process and analyze data from other acquisition and experimental modalities at the single-cell level, providing a valuable statistical framework for single-cell analysis </plain></SENT>
