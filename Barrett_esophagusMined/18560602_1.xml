<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among predisposing factors, both risk and protective polymorphic variants of several genes may influence the clinical outcomes of reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, different molecular mechanisms are likely to underlie the development of clinical variants of reflux disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety six patients with reflux disease were screened for polymorphisms of CARD15, SLC22A4 (OCTN1), SLC22A5 (OCTN2), DLG5, ATG16L1 and IL23R genes which had previously been found to associate with immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While none of the polymorphisms were associated with NERD or ERD, the 1142G/A variant of the IL23R gene was found to be a risk variant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IL23/IL23R pathway may modulate STAT3 transcriptional activity which is an essential regulator not only of immune-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, but also of inflammatory-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms of metaplastic transition of inflamed squamous epithelium are undetermined as yet, our findings suggest potential involvement of alternations in the IL23/IL23R pathway as a molecular background of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
