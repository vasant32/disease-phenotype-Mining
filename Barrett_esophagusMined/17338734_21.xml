<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Previous studies that evaluated extent of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) as a risk factor for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) were conflicting, and no prior study has evaluated extent of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (LGD) as a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this discovery study was to evaluate the hypothesis that extent of LGD and HGD are risk factors for progression to EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated baseline biopsies from 77 BE patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> including 44 who progressed to EA and 33 who did not progress during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total numbers of LGD and HGD crypts were determined separately by counting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> crypts and the extent of LGD, HGD, and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were correlated with EA outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-one and 46 patients had a maximum diagnosis of LGD and HGD, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the crypts were stratified by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> grade, the mean number of LGD crypts per patient was borderline higher in progressors (93.9) compared with nonprogressors (41.2, P= 0.07), and the mean proportion of LGD crypts per patient was significantly higher in progressors (46.4%vs 26.0%, P= 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither the mean number of HGD crypts per patient (P= 0.14) nor the mean proportion of HGD crypts per patient (P= 0.20) was significantly associated with EA outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The extent of LGD is a significant risk factor for the development of EA in BE in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the presence of HGD is significantly associated with a greater relative risk for development of EA, the extent of HGD was not an independent risk factor for progression </plain></SENT>
