<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite this increased risk, most cohort studies demonstrate that the mean life expectancy of subjects with BE is no different than age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The indirect costs associated with a diagnosis of BE are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the effect of a diagnosis of BE on insurance premiums </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed twenty national life insurance companies (10 in southern California, 10 in North Carolina) to determine the effect of a diagnosis of BE on life insurance premiums </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our base case in Los Angeles was a 36-yr-old female nonsmoker, and in North Carolina, a 43-yr-old Caucasian male nonsmoker, both in excellent health except for a diagnosis of prevalent BE with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The policy requested was a 20-yr guaranteed term life insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Companies were asked for their best price exclusive of the BE, and also their best price when considering BE as a preexisting condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For those companies not offering the "preferred" rates, the insurance representative was subsequently sent a physician's letter explaining BE and providing data substantiating a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life expectancy in the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Companies were also asked for health insurance quotes, including premiums and deductibles, inclusive and exclusive of the diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty national insurance companies were contacted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the 43-yr-old man with no BE, the yearly "preferred" premium for life insurance averaged $1,255 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean cost of the policies offered to the same individual with BE as a preexisting condition was $2,731 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For the 36-yr-old female the base rate exclusive of BE was $517, with a range of $472-$551 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After inclusion of the diagnosis of BE, the mean rate rose by 177%, to $1,434, with a range of $1,144-$1,896 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Companies either refused to provide health insurance to the individual with BE or would not provide a quote without review of the medical record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>None of the insurance companies changed their quoted rates after receiving the letter written by the physician on behalf of the individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the preponderance of data demonstrating a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life expectancy associated with the condition, a diagnosis of BE more than doubles life insurance premiums, and impacts the availability of health insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Further steps to educate insurance companies about the risks associated with BE are warranted, and patients should understand this additional "risk" of endoscopic screening for BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There are significant indirect costs associated with a diagnosis of BE </plain></SENT>
