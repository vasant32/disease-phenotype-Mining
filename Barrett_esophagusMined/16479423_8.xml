<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Endoscopic mucosal resection and photodynamic therapy are exciting, minimally invasive curative techniques that represent an alternative to surgery in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is lack of uniformity regarding which staging method should be used prior to therapy, and some investigators even question whether staging is required prior to ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with a protocol of conventional endoscopic ultrasound staging prior to endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 25 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who had been referred to the University of Chicago for staging in preparation for endoscopic therapy between March 2002 and November 2004 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 25 patients underwent repeat diagnostic endoscopy and conventional endosonography with a radial echo endoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any suspicious lymph nodes that were detected were sampled using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline pathology in the 25 patients (mean age 70, range 49-85) revealed high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 12 patients and intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients were found to have submucosal invasion on conventional endosonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had suspicious <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp>, six regional (N1) and one metastatic to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> axis (M1a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in five of these seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, five patients (20%) were deemed to be unsuitable candidates for endoscopic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By detecting unsuspected malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, conventional endosonography and endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> dramatically changed the course of management in 20% of patients referred for endoscopic therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, we believe that conventional endosonography and endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> when nodal disease is present should be performed routinely in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients referred for endoscopic therapy in this setting </plain></SENT>
