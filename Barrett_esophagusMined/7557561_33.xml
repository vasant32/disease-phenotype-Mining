<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ROS have been implicated in various gastrointestinal abnormalities, including the acid related peptic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> and Barrett's columnar epithelium is associated with prolonged reflux of gastric acid, the exact mechanism by which tissue damage occurs is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To discover if ROS are involved in damage to the oesophageal mucosa, this study measured in vitro the mucosal ROS concentrations of biopsied mucosal samples taken from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e> using luminol enhanced chemiluminescence (LECL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mucosal biopsy specimens were taken from 83 patients: 19 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal mucosa (group I); 20 with macroscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> (group II); 20 with biopsy confirmed Barrett's epithelium without macroscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> (group III); and 24 with Barrett's epithelium with macroscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> (group IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mucosa from patients exhibited significantly higher LECL values than the mucosa from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But, there were no significant differences between groups II, III, and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Addition of the myeloperoxidase inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40910">azide</z:chebi>, or the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> scavenger, catalase, to the tissue suspension caused a decrease in LECL values of 32% and 45%, respectively, suggesting that neutrophils--although important--are not the only source of mucosal LECL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with the proposal that ROS play an important part in the tissue injury associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oesophagitis</z:e> and Barrett's columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
