<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish the ideal power to be employed in order to get the effective ablation and the lowest rate of symptoms at <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma thermocoagulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight asymptomatic patients with BE, were randomly divided in two groups of different ablation powers, 50W or 70W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After endoscopic ablation and biopsies from the treated area for histological analyses, symptoms were evaluated through a questionnaire answered by phone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients without specialized columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> were excluded and the remaining fifteen patients, seven men (46,7%) and eight women (53,3%), with an average age of 53 years +10,4, composed the two groups: 10 patients at the 70W power and 5 at the 50W power group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the groups regarding age, BE extent, percentage of coagulated esophageal circumference and the duration of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pain was the most important symptom, with a mean duration of 10,3 + 9,7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When power was compared to symptoms, although not statistically significant, a moderate negative correlation was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic biopsies showed ablation restricted to the mucosa's superficial layer in 40% of the cases in the lower power group, and only 10% in the higher power group, although deeper layers of the mucosa were compromised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical significant differences when comparing the different powers to the penetration through the mucosa's layers and the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There are evidences that the 70W potency <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation for BE leads to a lower incidence of residual specialized columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> under the new scamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
