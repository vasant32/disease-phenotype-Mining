<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this study was to investigate whether oral steroids would reduce the incidence of stricture formation after photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) in Barrett's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of balloon window length, pretreatment of nodules, retreatment of skipped areas, and subsequent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> on the incidence of strictures was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ultimate goal of treatment was elimination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 60 patients were injected with Photofrin (2 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> (n = 30) or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two days later, 630 nm light (KTP/dye laser) was delivered using a 5- or 7-cm windowed balloon at a light dose of 200 or 175 J/cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients received 200 J/cm using a 7-cm balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nodules were pretreated with a short diffuser at a dose of 50-75 J/cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional light was delivered to skipped areas 2-3 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endoscopies were conducted every 3-6 months to evaluate the response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Residual or recurrent Barrett's was treated using <z:chebi fb="7" ids="33372">neodymium</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="6" ids="28984">aluminum</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser (small areas) or was retreated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The effect of steroids on the incidence of strictures was analyzed in patients receiving a single treatment with a light dose of 200 J/cm using a 7- cm balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no reduction in the incidence of strictures in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and steroids (29%) compared to those receiving <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> alone (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment using a 7-cm balloon caused more strictures (31%) than treatments using a 5-cm balloon (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of nodules or retreatment of skipped areas did not increase strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving subsequent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> had a higher incidence of strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> was eliminated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was eliminated in 41 of 43 patients (96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Barrett's mucosa was totally eliminated in 25 of 60 patients (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> did not reduce the incidence of strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Subsequent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and longer balloon window were associated with higher incidence of strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> followed by thermal ablation of small islands eliminated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
