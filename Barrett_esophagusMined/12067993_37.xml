<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Existing analytic methods,particularly those that are unsupervised, often have difficulty recognizing subtle differences among predefined subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, supervised methods, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), are able to recognize subtly different biological entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We applied ANNs in a proof-of-principle study of cDNA microarray data in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> (CA) and premalignancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>cDNA microarrays, each containing 8064 clones, were hybridized to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> from 22 esophageal lesions, including 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BA) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasias</z:mpath> and 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinomas</z:hpo> (3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> and 5 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scanned cDNA microarray data were analyzed using the bioinformatics software Cluster/TreeView, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>), and ANNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8064 clones on the microarrays was unable to correctly distinguish BA specimens from CA specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> then selected 160 differentially expressed genes between Barrett's and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis based on this reduced set still misclassified 2 Barrett's as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ANN was trained on 12 samples and tested against the remaining 10 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using the 160 selected genes, the ANN correctly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 samples in the test set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, the 160 genes selected by <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> may merit further study as biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in the esophagus, as well as in elucidating pathological mechanisms underlying BA and CA </plain></SENT>
