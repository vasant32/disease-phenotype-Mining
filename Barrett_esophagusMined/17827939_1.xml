<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the progression from BE to EA seems to be infrequent (0.5% per year), endoscopic and bioptic surveillance would play a significant role in the evaluation of HGD and the detection of EA in early, curable stage, improving survival rates after treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The severity and the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> could be helpful in the assessment of the risk for BE and to enroll these subjects into screening protocols to detect any dysplastic or neoplastic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The benefits of screening-surveillance programs could be furthermore enhanced by an improvement in diagnostic methods, such as high-resolution endoscopic techniques and the use of biomarkers for the histological examination seems to play a primary role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk stratification; in such way, endoscopic resection techniques (mucosal resection and submucosal dissection) can be considered as a helpful method to stage dysplastic changes in BE </plain></SENT>
