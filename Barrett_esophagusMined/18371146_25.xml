<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The incidence and mortality rates from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) are rapidly increasing in the western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemoprevention is being advocated to reduce the burden of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> are used clinically to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, and have an excellent safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> reduce the intracellular availability of several biosynthetic intermediates important in intracellular signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may effect EAC proliferation or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The OE33 and BIC-1 EAC cell lines and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40303">lovastatin</z:chebi>, and pravastatin were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation was quantified by thiazoyl blue colormetric and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was determined using assays for intracellular nucleosomes and caspase-3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detection of phosphorylated kinases, affinity precipitation, immunoblotting, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to determine the effects on intracellular signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> reduced viable cell number and inhibited proliferation in a similar dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and enhanced the antiproliferative effect of NS-398, a selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effects were dependent on farnesylation, but not geranylgeranylation, of intracellular targets, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> reduced serum-stimulated Ras activity  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> inhibited activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (Akt) but not c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase or p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein (MAP) kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> treatment increased <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and protein expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bad, but protein levels of the antiapoptotic proteins B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Bcl)-2 and Bcl-X(L) were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> inhibit proliferation and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in EAC cells via inhibition of Ras farnesylation and inhibition of the ERK and Akt signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> may have some potential as chemopreventative and adjuvant chemotherapeutic agents in EAC </plain></SENT>
