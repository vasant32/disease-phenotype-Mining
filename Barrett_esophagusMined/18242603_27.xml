<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained magnified images from 22 areas with the 4 aforementioned techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven endoscopists with no specific expertise in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> or advanced imaging techniques and 5 international experts in this field evaluated these 22 areas for overall image quality, mucosal image quality, and vascular image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the regularity of mucosal and vascular patterns and the presence of abnormal blood vessels were evaluated, and this was correlated with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The interobserver agreement for the 3 features of mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with white light images ranged from kappa = 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46-0.55) to kappa = 0.53 (95% CI: 0.50-0.57) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> observers, from kappa = 0.43 (95% CI: 0.33-0.54) to kappa = 0.53 (95% CI: 0.41-0.64) for experts, and from kappa = 0.51 (95% CI: 0.15-0.33) to kappa = 0.64 (95% CI: 0.58-0.70) for nonexperts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interobserver agreement in these groups did not improve by adding one of the enhancement techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The yield for identifying early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> with white light images was 86% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> observers, 90% for experts, and 84% for nonexperts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of enhancement techniques did not improve the yield <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of indigo carmine chromoendoscopy, <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy, or narrow-band imaging to white light images did not improve interobserver agreement or yield identifying early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
