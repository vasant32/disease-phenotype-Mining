<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured the expression of 18 selected genes and compared them to histological features in a spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal disease</z:e> to evaluate the feasibility of molecular characterization of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathologic esophageal epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Esophageal tissue biopsies from 82 patients with foregut symptoms were laser capture microdissected, and the expression levels of 18 selected genes were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linear discriminant analysis, which uses combinations of genes to distinguish between histological groups, was performed to compare gene expression and the following five histological groups: (1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium (n = 35), (2) reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (n = 13), (3) non-dysplastic Barrett's (n = 33), (4) dysplastic Barrett's (n = 16), (5) <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A panel of seven genes had 90-94% predictive power to distinguish non-dysplastic and dysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clustering analysis revealed structure in gene expression values even in the absence of histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression levels in 17 genes differed significantly across histological groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Classification based on gene expression agreed with histopathological assessment in the following percentage of cases: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium = 53%, reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> = 31%, non-dysplastic Barrett's = 76%, dysplastic Barrett's = 40%, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> = 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, predictive power improved markedly when inflammatory and dysplastic tissues were removed (77-94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gene expression classification agrees well with histopathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When differences occur, it is unclear whether this effect is due to intraobserver variability in pathological diagnosis or to a genuine difference between gene expression and histopathology </plain></SENT>
