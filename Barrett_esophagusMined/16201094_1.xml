<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Despite the progressive development of technology and better knowledge of physiopathology, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> diagnosis remains a medical problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to verify whether the measurement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> can increase the diagnostic accuracy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: 6 healthy volunteers adhered to a standard protocol, 11 Barrett's patients and 15 GERD patients (endoscopic erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>) were fasted for 6 h before any examinations and the patients ceased acid suppression medications 72 h earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Manometric study was performed to localize the LES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then The Bilitec 2000 fiberoptic probe (Synectics, Medtronics) and an <z:chebi fb="24" ids="30304,30513">antimony</z:chebi> pH probe attached to a Digitrapper Mark III pH recorder (Synectics, Medtronics), together, were inserted through the nostril and positioned 5cm above the LES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They received an uncolored diet and after around 24 h, both Bilitec and pH data were downloaded simultaneously to a personal computer for analysis, using the Synectics software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Absorbance threshold was set at 0.14 absorbance units and acceptable esophageal pH at 4, to verify fraction of time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e> (absorbance &gt; 0.14) and DeMeester score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Except controls, in whom DeMeester and Johnson scoring and fraction time of absorbance were always <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patterns of combined results were observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and Barrett's patients, showing possibilities of "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" pHmetry in patients with detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bile reflux</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fraction time of absorbance with pathologic pH recording and both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> (40%) and Barrett's patients (only 18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that Bilitec measurements combined with 24-hour monitoring of intraluminal pH can offer other diagnostic and screening contributions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> and Barrett's patients, but cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pHmetry and spectrophotometry demonstrate that none is definitive in characterization of reflux </plain></SENT>
