<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better study neoplastic evolution in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, the aim of this study was to establish in vitro cultures from preneoplastic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mechanical and enzymatic dissociation methods were used to initiate Barrett's epithelial cultures from endoscopic biopsy specimens, and the cells were characterized using flow-cytometric, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four long-term cultures were established from 39 attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cultures contain cytogenetic abnormalities and elevated flow-cytometric 4N DNA content fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic abnormalities detected include the following: 9p and/or CDKN2/p16 abnormalities in 4 of 4 cultures, 17p loss of heterozygosity and p53 mutation in 3 of 4 cultures, and 5q loss of heterozygosity in 1 of 4 cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inactivation of p53 was statistically associated with successful long-term culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These cultures contain cell cycle and molecular genetic abnormalities that closely parallel those previously documented to occur early in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These alterations also appear to be associated with successful growth in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cultures may provide a premalignant in vitro system in which to test potential therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> as well as to examine etiologic factors and genetic intermediates important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
