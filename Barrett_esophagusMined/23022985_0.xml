<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: There is an increasing burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (GORD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO), paralleled by an increasing incidence of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database, we derived the incidence GORD and BO and incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> (OC) populations, between 1996 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acid suppression treatment over the study period was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 5860 patients with BO and 1 25 519 with GORD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of BO increased from 0.11 to 0.24/1000 men and from 0.06 to 0.11/1000 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of GORD diagnosed in general practice remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 69 incident OCs in patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="30160">BOs</z:chebi> and 183 incident OCs in patients with GORD occurring more than a year after the GORD diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of OC was 3.00/1000 BO patient years and 0.30/1000 GORD patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a progressive decrease in H2RA prescriptions from 39 to 14.5% and an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> prescriptions from 52 to 79% in patients with a new diagnosis of GORD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of BO has doubled from 1996 to 2005, whereas the incidence of GORD has remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OC occurred 10 times more commonly in patients with BO than those with GORD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">Proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> prescribing increased gradually over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These trends have significant implications for healthcare planning and financing in the UK and other countries </plain></SENT>
