<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> is widely accepted, but the significance of esophageal columnar mucosa without histological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e>, is debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: We studied 128 patients free of Helicobacter pylori with reflux-related symptoms and columnar mucosa in the esophagus at endoscopy, 106 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (referred to as the Barrett group) and 22 patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (columnar group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples from 20 subjects free of H. pylori were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for keratin 7 (KRT7), keratin 20 (KRT20), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), mucin 2, oligomeric mucus/gel-forming (MUC2), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> protein p53 (TP53) was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Samples taken 1 cm above the gastroesophageal junction showed KRT7 staining in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in the Barrett and columnar groups and none in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for TP53 was absent in the control group, and more frequent in the columnar group (7, 31.8%) compared with the Barrett group (14, 13.2%, P=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the columnar group, low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and TP53 expression was seen in 7 of 22 biopsy specimens (31.8%) at baseline and in 4 additional specimens after 2 years, for a total of 11 specimens (50.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The expression of KRT7 might help to explain the pathological, reflux-related nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">columnar-lined esophagus</z:e>, as aberrant expression in a very early stage of the multistep <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of KRT7 may occur in basal glandular cells as a result of their multipotentiality and susceptibility to immunophenotype changes induced by reflux </plain></SENT>
