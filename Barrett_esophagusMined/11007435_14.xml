<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the degree of intratumoural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> we applied immunohistochemistry in primary Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (BCA) (n = 6) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> adjacent to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was performed in primary BCA (n = 5) and dysplastic areas (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For an objective evaluation digital image analysis and laser scanning microscopy were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of six BCA showed a marked intratumoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> staining pattern ranging from areas in which the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells were negative or faintly positive to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> areas with a strong staining of the entire membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the two dysplastic areas also a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> staining pattern was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis revealed marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of intratumoral gene copy number changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BCA showing populations with different fractions of cells with polysomy, low level amplification and high level amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed a minor population with Her-2/neu signal clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we observed marked intratumoural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of c-erbB-2 protein overexpression and Her-2/neu gene copy number in the majority of the primary BCA analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Digital image analysis and laser scanning microscopy were helpful in quantifying the variations in protein expression and DNA copy number in individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> could hamper the exact diagnostic determination of the c-erbB-2 status in small biopsies and possibly influence the effectiveness of a potential c-erbB-2 targeting therapy </plain></SENT>
