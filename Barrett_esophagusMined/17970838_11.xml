<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized crossover study comparing 4-quadrant random biopsies (4QB) versus MB-directed biopsies for the detection of SIM and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 48 patients with long segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (LSBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients randomly underwent two endoscopies over a 4-wk time period with either 4QB or MB-directed biopsies as their first or second exam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to correlate stain intensity with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity of MB for SIM and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 75.2% and 83.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The yield of 4QB for identifying nondysplasia SIM was 57.6% (523/917) and for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was 12% (111/917) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dark staining was significantly associated with histologic grade (P &lt; 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The final diagnosis was correct in 43 (90%) patients using MB and in 45 (94%) using 4QB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 4QB technique missed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 3 of 21 patients while MB biopsies missed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 5 of 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The discordance between the two techniques was not significant (P= 0.727, McNemar's test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean number of biopsies taken during 4QB was 18.92 +/- 6.36 and with MB was 9.23 +/- 2.89 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MB requires significantly fewer biopsies than 4QB to evaluate for SIM and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dark staining correlates more with HGD than LGD in our experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>While MB is not more accurate than 4QB, MB may help to define areas to target for biopsy during surveillance endoscopy in patients with LSBE </plain></SENT>
