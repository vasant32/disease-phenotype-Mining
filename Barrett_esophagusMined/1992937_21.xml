<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the prognosis of surgically treated patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has not been elucidated fully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine these and other issues, the records of 65 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> presenting at the Lahey Clinic Medical Center from January 1973 to January 1989 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During this period, 241 patients with documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were seen, for a prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>Adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> accounted for 30% of the surgically treated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the thoracic esophagus during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but four of these patients were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> reflux were present in less than one half of the patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was often the presenting symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In eight patients the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was discovered on routine surveillance endoscopy, and in four patients progression of disease from benign columnar epithelium to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was documented </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 65 patients, 61 (94%) were considered to have operable disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom underwent resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (3.3%) died within 30 days of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The resected specimens were staged as follows: stage 0, 4; stage I, 10; stage II, 17; stage III, 25; stage IV, 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the resected specimens, 73% showed areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> adjacent to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall adjusted actuarial 5-year survival rate was 23.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 3-year survival rate was 100% for patients with stage 0 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, 85.7% for patients with stage I <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, 53.6% for patients with stage IIA <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, 45% for patients with stage IIB <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, 25.2% for patients with stage III <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and 0% for patients with stage IV <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The premalignant nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> requires endoscopic surveillance to detect early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> because symptoms often occur late or are absent </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the Barrett's epithelium must be resected because a second <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> may develop in residual columnar epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> should be considered an indication for resection </plain></SENT>
