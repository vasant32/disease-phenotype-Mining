<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> requires reduction of gastric acid secretion and screening for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the current therapeutic options are ineffective in reducing the Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of endoscopic thermal coagulation of Barrett's mucosa as an alternative therapeutic approach and the recurrence of the disease in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients (11 men, 3 women; mean age 45.7 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They underwent laparoscopic fundoplication and were symptom free with no defective fundoplication wraps before therapeutic endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic thermocoagulation was performed with a flexible videoendoscope and a bipolar probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mucosal areas were treated once a month until the Barrett's mucosa disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy was performed 1 and 7 months after completion of the treatments and once a year thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 21.6 months (range 18 to 30 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was 4.8 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Successful ablation of the columnar epithelium was achieved in 3.7 sessions, as defined by demonstration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium at histologic examination of biopsy samples collected after completion of the treatments and at follow-up evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients experienced short-term (10 days) odynophagia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were symptom free with no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar electrocoagulation after antireflux operations is effective in promoting regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and has few complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic thermal coagulation might reduce risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> among these patients </plain></SENT>
