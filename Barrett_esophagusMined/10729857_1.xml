<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective analysis of patients operated with gastric banding (GB) and vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) between 1981 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients (4/92) initially operated with GB have developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> a mean of 9 years post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients (2/198) operated with VBG developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> 18 and 47 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histopathological type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was cardia-like in three cases, gastric-like in two cases and intestinal-like columnar epithelium in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the biopsies showed signs of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gastric banding is again gaining popularity with the development of adjustable bands that can be placed laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> after GB and VBG, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesion</z:e>, is cause for some concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prospective long-term studies are needed to further address this complication </plain></SENT>
