<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>High grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (with no extension under muscularis mucosae) can be indications for endoscopic treatments of Barrett oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When an endoscopic treatment is considered, a gastroscopy with use of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> and planimetry and the confirmation of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by a new examination after <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment and a pathologic second confirmation is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in focalised and visible lesions, an endoscopic resection by EMR or ESD should be proposed: it allows a more accurate pathologic examination and can be an effective curative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After endoscopic resection of visible high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> lesions, a complete eradication of Barrett oesophagus may be proposed to prevent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In case of extensive high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or to eradicate Barrett oesophagus residual lesions, radiofrequency ablation is the preferred endoscopic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy may also be proposed for more invasive lesions or after other endoscopic techniques with mucosal scars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical oesophagus resection is still recommended for diffuse high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in young patients or in case of pathologic pejorative criteria in endoscopic resection specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In case of Low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, either endoscopic surveillance should be performed every six or 12 months or radiofrequency ablation could be proposed in the yield of prospective studies </plain></SENT>
