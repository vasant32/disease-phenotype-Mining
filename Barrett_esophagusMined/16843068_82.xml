<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we have applied this technique to the in vivo diagnosis of Barrett's epithelium and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi>-aided endomicroscopy was performed by applying the endomicroscope over the whole columnar-lined lower esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Images obtained within 1 cm of the columnar-lined lower esophagus were stored digitally and a targeted biopsy examination or endoscopic mucosal resection of the examined areas was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo histology was compared with the histologic specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> digitally stored images were re-assessed by a blinded investigator by the confocal Barrett classification system to predict histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraobserver and interobserver variations of the involved endoscopists were evaluated by using kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endomicroscopy allowed distinguishing between different types of epithelial cells and detected cellular and vascular changes in Barrett's epithelium at high resolution during ongoing endoscopy in 63 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> could be predicted with a sensitivity of 98.1% and 92.9% and a specificity of 94.1% and 98.4%, respectively (accuracy, 96.8% and 97.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean kappa value for interobserver agreement for the prediction of histopathological diagnosis was .843, whereas the intraobserver agreement showed a mean kappa value of .892 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence-aided endomicroscopy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> allows in vivo histology of the mucosal layer during ongoing endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gastric and Barrett's epithelium and Barrett's-associated neoplastic changes can be diagnosed with high accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, endomicroscopy may be helpful in the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
