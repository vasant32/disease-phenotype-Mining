<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The application of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the basal cell layer and elongation of the papillae in the squamous epithelium of the distal oesophagus, as histological criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> (GORD), continues to be controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An unanswered question is whether these changes may regress under long-term treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This fact prompted us to investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment on the histological changes observed in the lower oesophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 295 patients with endoscopically confirmed erosive GORD were investigated by endoscopy/biopsy prior to and during the course of a 12-month <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment regimen (8 weeks <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment with 30 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi>/day followed by long-term treatment with 15 or 30 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6375">lansoprazole</z:chebi> or 20 mg <z:chebi fb="14" ids="7772">omeprazole</z:chebi>/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The parameters studied were the frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the basal cell layer and elongation of the papillae prior to treatment and on day 56 (D56), after 6 months (M6) and after 12 months (M12) of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the various treatment groups, the results showed no statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>Ulcers</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> (prior to treatment 21% and 31%, respectively) were detected statistically significantly less frequently under <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, D56: 1%, M6 and M12, 0%; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>, D56: 2%, M6: 4%, M12, 3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the basal cell layer and elongation of the papillae was found in 51% of the cases prior to treatment, the corresponding figures were only 3% (D56, M6) and 2% (M12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the percentage of cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophageal epithelium increased from 8% before treatment to 55% (D56), 66% (M6) and 63% (M12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows not only that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> heal under <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> treatment, but also that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the basal cell layer and elongation of papillae in the squamous epithelium of the oesophageal mucosa may normalize, and are thus presumably not '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiological variants' </plain></SENT>
