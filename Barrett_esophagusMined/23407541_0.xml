<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) is a condition in which the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced with metaplastic intestinal-type epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This epithelium can progress sequentially from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> to low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, then to high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and finally to invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many factors that appear to be risk factors for the presence of BE include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, and interestingly, the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>THE AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the predictive factors for progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) to BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 42 patients with endoscopically diagnosed and histopathologically verified BE were included in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analysed predictive factors such as: age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, alcohol consumption and smoking, reflux symptom duration in this patients, prevalence of short and long segment of BE, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After endoscopic examination of these patients, the presence of BE was verified with histopathological examination and finally, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with H. pylori was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 42 subjects, 25 (59%) were males and 17 (41%) were females, with mean age of 52.8Â±3.28 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was present in 24 of 42 patients (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>27 of 42 patients (64%) were smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptom duration in this patients was approximately 9.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From total number of patients, 52% were with SSBE and 48% patients were with LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>Hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was present in 64% of patients, of which 66% were with LSBE and 34% with SSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In these patients, prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with H. pylori was present in 12% of cases, 9.5% in patients with SSBE and 2.5% in patients with LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The important risk factors for appearance of BE in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> patients were male sex, middle age, smooking and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is an important factor for development of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Most of patients with BE also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, in majority of cases these were patients with LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Pylori in patients with BE was lower and this may predict a protective role of this microorganism </plain></SENT>
