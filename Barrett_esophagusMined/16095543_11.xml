<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, image cytometry has been shown to be more sensitive for diagnosing DNA content abnormalities (<z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>) than flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Image cytometry has often been performed using the semi-automated CAS 200 system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, an Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) was introduced to determine DNA content (DNA index), but it has not been validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the CAS 200 system and ACIS, we compared the DNA index (DI) obtained from the same archived formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> related lesions, including samples with specialized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although there was a very good correlation between the DI values determined by ACIS and CAS 200, the former was 25% more sensitive in detecting <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ACIS yielded a mean DI value 18% higher than that obtained by CAS 200 (p &lt; 0.001; paired t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the average time required to perform a DNA ploidy analysis was shorter with the ACIS (30-40 min) than with the CAS 200 (40-70 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results obtained by ACIS gave excellent inter-and intra-observer variability (coefficient of correlation &gt; 0.9 for both, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared with the CAS 200, the ACIS is a more sensitive and less time consuming technique for determining DNA ploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results obtained by ACIS are also highly reproducible </plain></SENT>
