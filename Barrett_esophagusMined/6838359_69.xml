<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Esophageal function was assessed with manometry and 24-hour pH monitoring of the distal esophagus in 22 patients with histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE), 31 consecutive patients with endoscopic grade 2 or 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and 33 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE had less lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, but similar length of sphincter exposed to the abdomen, than patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both groups had significantly less LES pressure and abdominal length than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with BE had statistically more esophageal acid exposure than patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, and both differed markedly from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also had a greater number of reflux episodes lasting longer than five minutes than patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, suggesting that the severity of acid exposure was due to a defect in esophageal clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of Barrett's mucosal change was related to the level of LES pressure and the number of reflux episodes that were five minutes or longer in duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that BE is related to a mechanical incompetency of the cardia and a decrease in esophageal clearance that requires reconstruction of the cardia for effective therapy </plain></SENT>
