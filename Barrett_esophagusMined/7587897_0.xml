<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the expression of AgNOR and PCNA in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were higher than those in benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, which were in turn higher than those in benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The difference between malignant group and other groups was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that AgNOR and PCNA may be useful as an adjunct in screening patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> for early malignant change, especially in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
