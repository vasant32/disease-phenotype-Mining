<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> is a risk factor for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of antireflux therapy on the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acid exposure in vitro induces hyperproliferation via a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic and animal studies suggest that COX inhibitors decrease the incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>.Aim: To study the differential effect of complete compared with incomplete acid suppression on proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients and METHODS: Fifty-one patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who underwent pH monitoring were divided into two groups according to their DeMeester score: 32 acid-suppressed patients (group 1) and 19 patients with abnormally high acid exposure (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Slides from biopsies taken 3 months before and 4 and 12 months after pH monitoring were stained for Mcm2, COX-2, c-myc, and cleaved caspase-3 (marker of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in terms of age, gender ratio, medication, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> status, and the expression levels of any marker before pH monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group 1, Mcm2 expression decreased in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface and throughout the tissue 12 months after monitoring when compared with the two previous time points (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of COX-2 increased overtime (P &lt; 0.01 in group 1, not significant in group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between Mcm2 and COX-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Acid suppression had no effect on c-myc or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term acid suppression reduces proliferation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> samples but has no advantageous effect on c-myc, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, or COX-2 </plain></SENT>
