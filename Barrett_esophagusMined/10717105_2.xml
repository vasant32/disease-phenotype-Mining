<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the past, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were thought to occur rarely in the esophagus and to comprise a small percentage of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years the incidence has risen so that they represent 25% to 35% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies have shown that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is more common in men than women ( approximately 8:1) and in whites than non-whites ( approximately 7:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common associated condition is <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but the evaluation is clouded by the inconsistent definition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in the gastroenterology literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> requires the identification of metaplastic glandular epithelium with goblet cells in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The management of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus is difficult to evaluate because the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are frequently included with squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the esophagus or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of the gastric cardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> are associated with a high rate of local recurrence when treated with surgery or radiation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their pattern of spread is different from that of gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> in that peritoneal seeding is uncommon and liver and pulmonary parenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> are less common, whereas pleural and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bony metastases</z:e> are more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This would suggest that they should be analyzed as a separate clinical entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the absence of prospective trials, the reported experience suggests that these patients should be considered for combined surgery and preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy and radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who are not candidates for surgery can receive effective and durable palliation from chemosensitized radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There are theoretical advantages to both preoperative and postoperative therapy and the selection of treatment programs should be individualized </plain></SENT>
