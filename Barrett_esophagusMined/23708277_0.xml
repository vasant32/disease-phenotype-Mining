<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a valuable treatment option in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> resulting in eradication of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Barrett's epithelium into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, esophageal impedance monitoring is hampered by low baseline impedance values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether these low baselines are caused by an intrinsically low impedance of cylindrical epithelium or by the excessive reflux itself is hitherto unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on esophageal motility after RFA are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine the effect of RFA on esophageal motility and esophageal baseline impedance in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 10 patients, conventional esophageal manometry and 24-h pH-impedance measurements were performed before and after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number and type of reflux episodes were assessed and baseline impedance values were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recording segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In another five patients, high-resolution manometry was performed before and after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Barrett's epithelium was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 patients after 3Â±1 RFA sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, no significant motility changes were found after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients had excessive acid exposure times before and after RFA [25 (17-42) and 16 (9-24)%, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Baseline esophageal impedance values were low, with the lowest values in the distal recording segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RFA increased baseline impedance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recording segments in the upright position; in the supine position, the effect just failed to reach statistically significant levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RFA did not alter esophageal motility significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Low esophageal baseline impedance levels in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> reflect, at least in part, intrinsic impedance properties of cylindrical epithelium, as baselines increased after conversion into neosquamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
