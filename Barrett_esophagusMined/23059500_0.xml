<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify a set of microRNAs (miRNAs) as prognostic molecular biomarkers for the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) to rationalize the surveillance programs in patients with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Histological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is currently used as the main biomarker to identify the BE patients at high risk for developing EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although miRNA expression profiles in BE and EAC have been reported, it has not been established which set of miRNAs could constitute a robust diagnostic test to predict the progression of BE to EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: miRNAs associated with progression of BE to EAC were identified using miRNA sequencing analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further validation by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed in 2 groups of BE patients who either developed or did not develop <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> after at least 5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three miRNAs were identified by miRNA sequencing analysis in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> process associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>qRT-PCR analysis using independent tissue samples confirmed differential expression for 19 of them (miR-let-7c, 7, 146a, 149, 153, 192, 192*, 194, 194*, 196a, 196b, 200a, 203, 205, 215, 424, 625, 625*, and 944) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, only miR-192, 194, 196a, and 196b showed a significantly higher expression in BE samples from patients with progression to EAC compared with those who did not progress to EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the expression pattern of a modest number of miRNAs in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> biopsies could identify the BE patients at high risk for developing EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it has potential use for the control and treatment of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
