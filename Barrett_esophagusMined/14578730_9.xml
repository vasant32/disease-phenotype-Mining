<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The association of EA and GER in children is well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the prevalence of GER and its potential complications in adults who have undergone correction of EA as a child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective analysis of the prevalence of GER and its complications over 28 years after correction of EA by means of a questionnaire, esophagogastroscopy, and histologic evaluation of esophageal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The questionnaire was returned by 38 (95%) of 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A quarter of the patients had no complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Swallowing solid food was a problem for 13 patients (34%), and mashed foods for 2 (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heartburn was experienced by 7 patients (18%), retrosternal pain by 8 (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, none of the patients were using antireflux medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients (61%) agreed to undergo esophagogastroscopy, which showed macroscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> in 1 patient, which was confirmed by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient developed complaints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A squamous cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed and treated by transthoracic subtotal esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high incidence of GER-related complications after correction of EA, but it is still very disputable if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EA patients should be screened at an adult age </plain></SENT>
