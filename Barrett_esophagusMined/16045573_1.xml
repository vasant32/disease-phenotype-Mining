<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have observed very good results concerning the clinical and objective control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> at the long-term follow up after this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it could be associated with other nonesophageal symptoms or side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to evaluate the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, dumping, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and anastomotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>) after this operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study 73 patients were assessed using a careful clinical questionnaire asking regarding these complications at the early (&lt; 6 months) and late (&gt; 6 months) follow-up (average of 32.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the early postoperative period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> was present in 64% (19% considered severe 10-90 days after surgery), dumping in 41% and loss of weight in 71% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>Diarrhea</z:hpo> occurred daily in 47.7% in the early postoperative period, but only in 16% of cases after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Shortly after surgery, steatorrea was observed in 9% of cases and responded well to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> or dumping was rare (5% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These symptoms improved significantly after 1 year with medical management (45%, 20% and 30%, respectively) and 42% of patients regained their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only two patients presented anastomotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and were treated satisfactory with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Revisional surgery was indicated in two patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dumping syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most side-effects identified by this study were mild and diminished 1 year after operation </plain></SENT>
