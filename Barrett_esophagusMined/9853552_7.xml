<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Columnar epithelium-lined esophagus (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>) is an acquired disorder associated with a high incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the lower esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Columnar epithelium resembling <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) is especially important, since it is considered to be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant condition</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to define the sulfated carbohydrate chain of mucin and its core <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> profile in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) and to compare it with the profile in Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and lower esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sulfated carbohydrate chain was not expressed in 16 specimens of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium, but in BE, it was expressed in 50% (8/16) of the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This chain was detected in 100% (7/7) of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> specimens, including four cases of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the sulfated carbohydrate chain may be associated with malignant phenotype of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MUC1 core <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was positive in 87% (13/15) of BE specimens and in 29% (2/7) of the esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MUC2 core <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was present in 57% (8/14) and 43% (3/7) of these specimens, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that Barrett's epithelium, which is similar to IM, but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal epithelium, expresses the sulfated sugar chain which is known to be present in gastric IM and colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant correlation between the expression of the sulfated sugar chain and the expression of either mucin core <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> MUC1 or MUC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, this carbohydrate chain may be expressed on as yet unidentified core proteins, other than MUC1 or MUC2 core <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, in BE and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Identification of these proteins may be very important in helping to detect premalignant status in BE </plain></SENT>
