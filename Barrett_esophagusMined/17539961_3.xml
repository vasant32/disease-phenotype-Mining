<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is still uncertain whether <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> (IM) of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) plays a role in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagogastric junction (AEGJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to clarify the relationship between AEGJ and IM in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight AEGJ, &lt;3 cm and centered within 1 cm of the EGJ, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of IM around AEGJ and the correlation between IM and clinicopathological features were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IM was present in the surrounding mucosa in 22 of 48 cases (46%), and was seen more frequently in older patients (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> was observed only in cases in which the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were not associated with IM (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gastric phenotype was seen almost exclusively in the group without IM, while the intestinal phenotype was predominant in the group with IM (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study found a lower incidence of associated IM than Western studies, and there were significant differences in clinicopathological features between AEGJ with and without IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that AEGJ may develop via two distinct pathways in Japanese patients: IM-related and IM-unrelated </plain></SENT>
