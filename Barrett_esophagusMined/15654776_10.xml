<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because of a rapid increase in the incidence of Barrett's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, the appropriate surveillance method for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">Methylene blue</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy has been reported to be an effective and inexpensive method to improve biopsy surveillance of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the usefulness of this method in short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cases is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study was undertaken to evaluate the abilities of crystal violet and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy to detect potentially dysplastic Barrett's epithelium in cases with short-segment columnar-appearing epithelium of the esophago-gastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred patients with endoscopically suspected short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive chromoendoscopy with 0.05% crystal violet, 0.1% crystal violet, 0.5% <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi>, or 1.0% <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During crystal violet and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> chromoendoscopy, biopsy specimens were obtained from stained and unstained columnar-appearing epithelium of the esophago-gastric junction, and the detection rates of Barrett's epithelium were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The value of pit pattern diagnosis was also evaluated as a possible way to detect dysplastic Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Chromoendoscopy with 0.05% crystal violet detected histologically confirmed Barrett's epithelium with the highest sensitivity (89.2%) and specificity (85.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Crystal violet clearly stained both dysplastic and nondysplastic Barrett's epithelia and made the surface pit pattern easy to observe without using magnifying endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of crystal violet chromoendoscopy and pit pattern diagnosis is considered to be useful for the surveillance of short-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
