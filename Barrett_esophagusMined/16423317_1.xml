<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is relatively standardized; however, controversy remains regarding appropriate therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment recommendations for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> vary widely, from periodic endoscopic surveillance to endoscopic ablative therapies and esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selected studies have shown that a relatively high percentage (41% to 47%) of patients with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> have occult <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these patients, surgery is indicated, as esophagectomy can be curative for early stage <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A major criticism of esophagectomy is the significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minimally invasive esophagectomy was developed in an effort to reduce the morbidity associated with open esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In minimally invasive esophagectomy, the abdominal laparotomy is replaced with laparoscopy, and the conventional right thoracotomy is replaced with thoracoscopy to reduce the operative trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In experienced centers, minimally invasive esophagectomy is now an attractive alternative for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
