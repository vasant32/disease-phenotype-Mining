<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the existence of cyclo-oxygenase-2 expressing cells in Barrett's epithelium is still uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To identify the cells that express cyclo-oxygenase-2 protein and to investigate the relationship between cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression and mucin-phenotype of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sections from 466 biopsy samples of Barrett's epithelium from 358 non-medicated patients were immunohistochemically examined for the cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression, mucin-phenotype, cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression was detected in 71.0% of Barrett's epithelium biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's epithelium with the gastric predominant mucin-phenotype, cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression was mainly found in stromal and deep epithelial cells, whereas in intestinal predominant mucin-phenotype, it was mostly in superficial epithelial cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant elevation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen index and suppression of apoptotic index was observed in Barrett's epithelium with superficial epithelial cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither such elevation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen index nor the suppression of apoptotic index could be found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Barrett's epithelium with intestinal mucin and superficial epithelial cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression possess a higher proliferation potential, but this risk may be thwarted by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
