<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is a condition that is premalignant for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early detection of Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is very important to decrease the mortality and morbidity from esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi>-targeted biopsies in the differential diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 109 patients (43 women and 66 men; average age, 62.32 +/- 10.61 years; range, 33-82 years) were enrolled for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four groups were designed before endoscopic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients for these groups were selected at the conventional endoscopy, and then chromoendoscopy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The esophagus was stained with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi>, after which six biopsies were taken from stained and unstained areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Conventional and chromoendoscopic assessments were compared with histopathologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of chromoendoscopy for Barrett's epithelium was superior to that of conventional endoscopy (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was no statistical difference between the two methods in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stained biopsies were superior to unstained biopsies in terms of sensitivity for Barrett's epithelium and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Chromoendoscopy is useful for delineating Barrett's epithelium and for indicating the correct location for securing biopsies where <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> is suspected </plain></SENT>
