<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> usually demonstrate impaired esophageal motility, which affects acid clearance, together with reduced chemo-receptor sensitivity and symptom severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ablative endoscopic techniques are now used to eliminate Barrett's cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis for this study was that ablation with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC) may affect esophageal sensitivity and motility in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, and the aim of this study was to assess differences in these parameters before and after APC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were investigated before and after APC therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After standard pull through manometry, water bolus aliquots were given to assess primary peristalsis and rapid water and air bolus injections to assess secondary peristalsis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity studies were carried out using weak solutions of either <z:chebi fb="63" ids="17883">hydrochloric acid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="25" ids="32145">sodium hydroxide</z:chebi>, together with saline washouts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> time for typical symptoms (t), sensory intensity rating (I), and a sensory score (SS) = (t) x (I)/100 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the lower esophageal sphincter pressures (13.6 mm Hg versus 12.6 mm Hg, P= 0.8) and successful test swallows (3 mm Hg versus 5 mm Hg, P= 0.5) before and after treatment, but there was a trend for secondary peristalsis to improve (air bolus 0 versus 2, P= 0.05, water bolus 0 versus 1, P= 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity studies showed a smaller sensitivity intensity rating to both acid (61 versus 31, P= 0.02) and alkaline (91 versus 64, P= 0.03) after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have shown no substantive changes in esophageal motility after ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> cells, but have demonstrated reduced sensitivity to reflux type solutions </plain></SENT>
