<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of risk factors have been linked to both conditions, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms by which these factors influence disease progression remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One possibility is that risk factors generate promutagenic DNA damage in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The comet assay was used to measure DNA damage in esophageal (Barrett's and squamous) and gastric mucosa of Barrett's patients with (n = 24) or without (n = 50) associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in comparison with control patients (squamous mucosa) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients completed a questionnaire detailing exposure to some of the known risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients, DNA damage was higher in Barrett's mucosa compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal and gastric mucosa (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the highest quartile of DNA damage in Barrett's mucosa was associated with an increased risk (odds ratio, 9.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-83.4; P = 0.044) of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> compared with DNA damage levels in the lowest quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Smoking was associated with higher DNA damage in squamous epithelium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups (P &lt; 0.01) and in Barrett's mucosa (P &lt; 0.05) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> patients only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In controls only, current reflux was associated with higher DNA damage, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> use resulted in lower levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data imply a genotoxic insult to the premalignant Barrett's mucosa that may explain the genetic instability in this tissue and the progression to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is an indication for a role for smoking in inducing DNA damage in esophageal mucosa but an understanding of the role of reflux requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
