<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Recent advances in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> may kindle enthusiasm for screening for esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e>) are recognized as relative risks for EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the absolute incidence of EAC in specific populations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to estimate the symptom-, age-, and sex-specific incidences of EAC, and place these incidences in the perspective of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> for which screening is endorsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Markov computer model utilizing published and publicly available data was created to estimate the age- and sex-specific incidences of EAC in American white non-Hispanics with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of EAC in men younger than 50 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms is very low (for instance, at the age of 35 years, incidence=1.0/100,000), and their incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is relatively much higher (for instance, at the age of 35 years, incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is 6.7-fold greater) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of EAC in older men with weekly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms is substantial (for instance, at the age of 70 years, incidence=60.8/100,000 person-years), but their incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is at least threefold greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of EAC in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> is extremely low, and similar to that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in men (for instance, 3.9/100,000 person-years at the age of 60 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screening for EAC should not be performed in men younger than 50 years or in women because of very low incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, regardless of the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In white men with weekly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GERD</z:e> over the age of 60 years, the incidence of EAC is substantial, and might warrant screening if that practice is particularly accurate, safe, effective, and inexpensive </plain></SENT>
