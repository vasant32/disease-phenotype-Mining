<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this research is to verify the incidence of this specific kind of epithelium at the "Gastrocentro", at State University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil, among the total of 15,976 upper digestive endoscopies, performed from january of 1992 to December of 1995 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among this group of patients, the endoscopist suspected of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> in 110 cases (4.6%) and biopsed the distal esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, only in 85 cases (77.3%) the pathologist confirmed the diagnosis of Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were 53 males (62.3%), presenting the mean age of 52.2 years and the following grades of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>: grade I-33 cases (38.8%); grade II-15 cases (17.7%); grade III-15 cases (17.7%), grade IV-12 cases (14.1%) and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>-10 cases (11.7%) </plain></SENT>
