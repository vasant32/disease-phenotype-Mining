<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the occurrence of chromosomal DNA and cell cycle-related protein changes in Barrett's epithelium and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of numerical chromosomal aberrations was studied by applying nonisotopic in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) with (peri-)centromeric DNA probes, specific for chromosomes 7, 8, 17, and Y, to routinely processed tissue sections of five cases (4 male, 1 female) of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and adjacent Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle-related protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for p53 protein and the Ki-67 antigen (Mib-1) in subsequent sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P53 protein overexpression was found in 3 of the 5 tumors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overrepresentation of chromosome 8 and loss of chromosome 17 were found in 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, both also negative for p53 protein overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Y-loss, mostly clonal, was detected in 3 of the 4 male <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and 2 cases of adjacent Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had both areas of overrepresentation and loss of the Y chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> appeared to contain aneuploid cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No relation was found between cell proliferation characteristics and chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> with chromosome specific DNA probes can be applied for the assessment of potentially important numerical chromosome changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, the combination of IHC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> is useful for evaluation of specific genetic events </plain></SENT>
