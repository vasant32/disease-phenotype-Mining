<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The dismal outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> patients highlights the need for novel prognostic biomarkers, such as microRNAs (miRNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although recent studies have established the role of miRNAs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo>, a comprehensive multicenter study investigating different histologic types, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with or without Barrett's, is still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: miRNA expression was measured in cancerous and adjacent noncancerous tissue pairs collected from 100 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 70 <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> patients enrolled at four clinical centers from the United States, Canada, and Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microarray-based expression was measured in a subset of samples in two cohorts and was validated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients, miR-21, miR-223, miR-192, and miR-194 expression was elevated, whereas miR-203 expression was reduced in cancerous compared with noncancerous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> patients, we found elevated miR-21 and reduced miR-375 expression levels in cancerous compared with noncancerous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When comparing cancerous tissue expression between <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> patients, miR-194 and miR-375 were elevated in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly, elevated miR-21 expression in noncancerous tissue of <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> patients and reduced levels of miR-375 in cancerous tissue of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> patients with Barrett's were strongly associated with worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Associations with prognosis were independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage or nodal status, cohort type, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our multicenter-based results highlight miRNAs involved in major histologic types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> and uncover significant associations with prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elucidating miRNAs relevant to esophageal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> is potentially clinically useful for developing prognostic biomarkers and identifying novel drug targets and therapies </plain></SENT>
