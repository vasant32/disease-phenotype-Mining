<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific patterns of type 1 and type 2 Lewis blood group antigen expression were found in the surface and glands of the esophagus, gastric fundus, and duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In biopsy specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, gastric fundic-type columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> expressed Lewis antigens indistinguishable from those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Barrett's junctional and specialized columnar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>, Lewis a antigen was aberrantly expressed on the surface in secretors and in the glands independent of secretor state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lewis x reactivity was markedly diminished in the glands of Barrett's junctional and specialized columnar epithelium irrespective of secretor state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant aberrancy observed in the expression of Lewis b and y antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed aberrant expression of Lewis antigens may be caused by an altered differentiation program in Barrett's metaplastic epithelium and may define a role for these glycoconjugates in the process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
