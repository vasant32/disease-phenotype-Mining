<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in BE is still not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and the homeobox gene transcription factor <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 has been suggested in the pathogenesis of BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present study were 1) to compare the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 in biopsies obtained from patients with BE and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous epithelium and 2) to study the effect of two different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22868">bile salts</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9907">ursodeoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (UDCA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28834">deoxycholic acid</z:chebi> (DCA), on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in Barrett's the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line (OE-33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 expression was measured in Barrett's mucosa and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa obtained from 15 patients with BE histologically diagnosed by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In in vitro experiments, OE-33 cells were incubated with DCA (100 microM) and UDCA (100 microM) in neutral and shortly acidified media (pulse acidification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 and VEGF was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 were significantly up-regulated in Barrett's mucosa as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In neutral medium, OE-33 cells showed an increase in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 expression after incubation with DCA or UDCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After short acidification of the medium, expression of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 in OE-33 cells was significantly higher than that in cells incubated in neutral pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The addition of DCA and UDCA did not cause any further alteration in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In neutral and acidified medium, VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was only significantly up-regulated by DCA, but not by UDCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">Bile acids</z:chebi>, especially in acidic medium, increase expression of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DCA appears to be a stronger stimulant of the expression of VEGF than UDCA in the Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line, indicating a stronger carcinogenic potential of this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile salt</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
