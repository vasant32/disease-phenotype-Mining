<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to measure telomere length in a series of Barrett's <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (BAs), focusing on the telomere/centromere fluorescent intensity ratio (TCR) with tissue quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 11 cases of BA were evaluated for upper esophagus (UE), lower esophagus (LE), Barrett's mucosa (BM), BA, and gastric cardiac mucosa (GC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Q-FISH was performed using two kinds of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48021">peptide nucleic acid</z:chebi> probe, specific for telomeres and centromeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sections were analyzed with a CCD camera and original software (Tissue Telo) for measuring TCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, Laser Capture Microdissection and GeneScan were implemented for evaluation of genetic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The TCR values in BM and, to a lesser extent, BA were significantly lower than those in the other tissues, particularly in heterozygosity (LOH)-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was evident between microsatellite instability (MSI)-positive and -negative groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our study of BA series, telomere length appeared to change with the degree of histological atypia, with decreases linked to LOH </plain></SENT>
