<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Long-term intra-oesophageal acid suppression with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> represents a management option for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e>, but its stability over time has not been adequately assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: Our aim was to evaluate prospectively the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> in suppressing intra-oesophageal acidity after 2-year continuous treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677659,C0014869" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reflux oesophagitis</z:e> on a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitor</z:chebi> regimen (once or twice daily) that normalised the total percentage acid exposure time were re-evaluated by means of 24-h oesophageal pH-monitoring after 2-year of continuous unmodified treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant rise in the total percentage acid exposure time was observed at 2-year follow-up (P=0.029), owing to an increased value in 27 (60%) cases (9 on a twice daily regimen), higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 10 of them (22% of the whole group) (3 on a twice daily regimen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 18 patients (40%) the total percentage acid exposure time was stable or decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heartburn remained efficiently suppressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton pump inhibitors</z:chebi> in suppressing intra-oesophageal acidity during continuous treatment may decrease over time, up to abnormal levels of oesophageal acid exposure in a minority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This may occur without heartburn recurrence and with both once and twice daily regimens </plain></SENT>
