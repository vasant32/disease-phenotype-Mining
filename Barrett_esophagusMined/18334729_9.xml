<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Unless detected at an early stage, esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) has a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in cellular DNA content and expression levels of p53 and Ki67 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) are associated with the development EAC and might serve as markers to identify EAC at an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the presence of these three markers in various steps of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in BE towards EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> was graded in 212 biopsy sets taken during follow-up upper endoscopy in 27 patients in whom ultimately high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or EAC was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ploidy status was determined by flow cytometry, whereas Ki67 and p53 expression were determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Smoothing splines were used to analyze trends in time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found an increasing fraction of Ki67 overexpression and, to a lesser extent, abnormal DNA content in biopsies closer to the time-point of detecting HGD/EAC in BE, suggesting the potential value of these biomarkers in identifying patients at increased risk of progression towards HGD/EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of p53 was seen several years before development of HGD/EAC, and may therefore be an early marker in BE at a stage when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is not yet detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A prospective follow-up study is needed to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
