<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical results of patients operated with the Nissen, Nissen-Rossetti and Toupet techniques, in Centro Medico ABC, for the treatment of pathologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, and to determine if there is a difference when dividing the short gastric vessels with complete mobilization of the gastric fundus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: We carried out a retrospective, longitudinal, comparative and observational study of 241 laparoscopic fundoplications performed in Centro Medico ABC, between January 2000 and May 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following variables were analyzed: age, sex, smoking, habits, drinking habits, time of evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, typical and atypical clinical manifestations, medical treatment received, preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal motility disorders</z:e>, preoperative and postoperative pressure of the inferior esophageal sphincter, 24-hour pH monitoring, type of fundoplication, division of short gastric vessels, complete mobilization of the gastric fundus, closure of the pillars, diameter of probang, fundoplication fixed to the right pillar, suture applied, transoperative endoscopy, days of hospitalization, time before applying orally, morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the clinical follow-up, patients were contacted via telephone, assessing the following variables: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> for liquids, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> for solids, heartburn, postprandial fullness, gastric bubble, ability to belch, flatulence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, medical treatment post-fundoplication, esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, reoperation, satisfaction with procedure divided into 5 levels: excellent, satisfied, moderately satisfied, poorly satisfied, unsatisfied and, for each group, the modified Visick scale was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These variables were analyzed and compared between Nissen, Nissen-Rossetti and Toupet fundoplication, attempting to identify a significant statistical difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Qualitative analysis; Chi-square at p &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 241 patients underwent laparoscopic fundoplication surgery in Centro Medico ABC between January 2000 and May 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>27.4% (n = 66) corresponded to Nissen fundoplication, 31.5% (n = 76) to Nissen-Rossetti and 41.1% (n = 99) to Toupet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Males predominated at 65.6% (n = 158) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Average age was 42 years ranging from 18 to 76 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We were able to contact and interview 231 patients via telephone, which corresponded to 95.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up time was 12 months, ranging from 6 to 18 months in which the control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> was higher for the Nissen group at 98.5%, Nissen-Rossetti 93% and Toupet 73% with statistical significance p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the Toupet group 27% (n = 26) had recurrent heartburn and 11% (n = 8) had persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in the Nissen-Rossetti group p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Six patients underwent reoperation, five (7%) of the Nissen-Rossetti group due to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and one (1%) of the Toupet group due to the dismantling of the fundoplication and recurrence of symptoms p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The clinical condition during follow-up was superior for the Nissen group (Visick I-II in 98.5% p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Morbidity was 2.4%, with no operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results are comparable to the ones published in the world literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In our hands, a Nissen fundoplication with complete mobilization of the fundus yielded the best results, a Nissen-Rossetti operation had more disphagia and more reoperations and a partial fundoplication of Toupet, had a higher incidence of recurrent heartburn </plain></SENT>
