<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have implicated hydrophobic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and gastric acid in BE and EAC pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that DNA damage, cytotoxicity and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and gastric acid can be attenuated by the cytoprotective, hydrophilic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-dysplastic BE cells were exposed for 10 min to pH 4 and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> cocktail or to pH 4 and a modified cocktail consisting of a mixture of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and GUDCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA damage was evaluated by the comet assay; cell viability and proliferation were measured by trypan blue staining and the MTS assay; reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using hydroethidium staining; oxidative DNA/<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> damage was detected by immunostaining with antibody against 8-OH-dG; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> levels were measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51626">5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51626">CMFDA</z:chebi>) staining; and the expression of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> proteins was evaluated by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> were significantly increased, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> levels were decreased in BE cells treated with pH 4 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> cocktail compared with cells treated with pH 4 alone or untreated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">Bile acids</z:chebi> and low pH also significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0000352'>decreased cell proliferation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes, MnSOD and CuZnSOD, was elevated in the cells treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and low pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When GUDCA was included in the medium, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these effects of pH 4 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> were markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, treatment of BE cells with acidified medium and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> cocktail at physiologically relevant concentrations induces DNA damage, cytotoxicity, and ROS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cytoprotective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi>, GUDCA, inhibits these deleterious effects by inhibiting <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
