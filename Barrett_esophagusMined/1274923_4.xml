<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> has an increased tendency to bleed and is more prone to undergo malignant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are many procedures used to diagnose this entity, but only by serial and multiple esophageal mucosal biopsies can the diagnosis be confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Harper et al (2) demonstrated an early and intense uptake of 99m Tc pertechnetate by the stomach in animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> is lined by gastric mucosa, pertechnetate scintigraphy was used as a screening procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The criteria for a postive scan was an area of increased uptake of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi> extending above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dense uptake of stomach configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pertechnetate scintigraphy was performed in 4 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and 6 controls with only one false negative result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus pertechnetate scintigraphy is a rapid, safe, and atraumatic screening procedure </plain></SENT>
