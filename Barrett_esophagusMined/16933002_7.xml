<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The endoscopic grade of the gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV) is suggested to be a good predictor of reflux status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the GEFV and gastroesophageal and gastropharyngeal reflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 364 patients (151 men and 233 women; mean age, 52.2 years) who underwent endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and ambulatory 24-h dual-probe pH monitoring were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GEFV was graded I through IV using Hill's classification; then, GEFV was classified into two groups: a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GEFV group (grades I and II) and an abnormal GEFV group (grades III and IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings of endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and ambulatory pH monitoring were compared between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased GEFV grade was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of both reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and Barrett's epithelium (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower esophageal sphincter pressure was significantly lower in the abnormal GEFV group than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GEFV group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> variables showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> in the distal probe were significantly higher in the abnormal GEFV group than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GEFV group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables, except the supine time of pH &lt; 4, showing gastropharyngeal reflux in the proximal probe were significantly higher in the abnormal GEFV group than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GEFV group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and of gastropharyngeal reflux disease was significantly higher in the abnormal GEFV group than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GEFV group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endoscopic grading of the GEFV is easy and provides useful information about the status of gastroesophageal and gastropharyngeal reflux </plain></SENT>
