<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) are at risk of developing esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, which is usually preceded by dysplastic changes of the metaplastic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to increase the understanding of the development of dysplastic lesions in BE through the identification of genes that are differentially transcribed in these tissue types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paired biopsy samples from non-dysplastic BE, and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> from a single patient were used for histological evaluation and gene expression profile analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, relative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of differentially expressed genes were tested to validate the association with the presence or absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (58 biopsy samples containing squamous epithelium, non-dysplastic BE, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> from 23 unrelated patients) and immunohistochemistry (9 sets of paired non-dysplastic/high-grade dysplasiac samples from 9 unrelated patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microarray results from high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed 866 genes with a&gt;2-fold difference in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels compared with non-dysplastic BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent comparison of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of the 22 genes with a&gt;10-fold difference in 76 unrelated biopsies showed that only two of these genes, i.e. calgranulin A (S100A8; p=0.017) and calgranulin B (S100A9; p=0.022), were consistently up-regulated in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, as were protein levels for calgranulin A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an association between the calprotectin complex, which is involved in chemotaxis of neutrophils, and the progression towards high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It remains to be established whether differentially expressed proteins in biopsies form BE can be used to facilitate the diagnosis of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in BE </plain></SENT>
