<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is being advocated as a diagnostic, staging, and therapeutic technique for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> (BE)-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the emergence of new endoluminal therapy including EMR for the treatment of BE-related superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, accurate staging has become crucial to select patients for different treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> can be successfully treated by endoluminal techniques, whereas submucosal invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a greater risk of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> are likely candidates for esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is used to stage superficial BE-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, yet endoscopic staging can be incongruent to that obtained after pathologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to determine morphologic factors, which may influence EUS staging in 35 cases with intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> diagnosed by subsequent EMR, focusing on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics and structural changes associated with BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the latter duplication of the muscularis mucosae, either fragmented or well-organized, was seen in 64% of 11 cases that were overstaged as having submucosal invasion by EUS, compared with 38% of those accurately staged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A greater vertical thickness of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was also associated with overstaging by EUS (1.61+/-0.75 mm in the discordant vs. 1.16+/-0.67 mm in the concordant groups, P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results illustrate how morphologic factors may affect EUS staging of superficial esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EUS alone is not sufficient for staging these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> precisely, and to accurately stratify patients into different treatment arms, EMR should play a role as a complementary staging modality </plain></SENT>
