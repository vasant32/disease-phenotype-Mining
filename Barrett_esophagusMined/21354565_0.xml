<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and determinants of BE in children who are free from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> and tracheoesophageal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective, cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Three pediatric GI Centers in Houston, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; and Portland, Maine between February 2006 and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved children and adolescents consecutively presenting for elective upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with neurodevelopmental and tracheoesophageal disorders were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Endoscopic pictures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with suspected BE were independently reviewed and verified by two experienced investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Esophageal biopsy specimens were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and targeted biopsy specimens also were obtained from suspected BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Endoscopically suspected BE and histologically confirmed BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 840 patients (mean age 9.5 years) were enrolled and had complete questionnaire and endoscopic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were suspected of having BE (prevalence of 1.43%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-2.45), and only 1 patient had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath>, for a prevalence of 0.12% (95% CI, 0-0.65), whereas the rest had gastric oxyntic glands (n=6) or squamous esophageal epithelium (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with suspected BE had a higher mean body mass index (23.0 vs 19.1, P=.05) and more <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (50% vs 13%, P&lt;.01) than patients without BE or reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, heartburn, and regurgitation in patients with suspected BE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The accuracy of BE prevalence estimates is limited by the small number of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BE is rare in children without neurodevelopmental delay or tracheoesophageal anomalies presenting for elective upper endoscopy </plain></SENT>
