<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> in the development of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and precursor lesions in people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e>--a metaplastic disorder that confers a high risk of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We did a prospective study of the relation between duration, frequency, and recency of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use and the risk of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, and tetraploidy in a cohort of 350 people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> followed for 20,770 person-months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used proportional-hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios (HR) adjusted for age, sex, cigarette use, and anthropometric measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Median follow-up was 65.5 months (range 3.1-106.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with never users, HR for oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n=37 cases) in current <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> users was 0.32 (95% CI 0.14-0.76), and in former users was 0.70 (0.31-1.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>5-year cumulative incidence of oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was 14.3% (95% CI 9.3-21.6) for never users, 9.7% (4.5-20.5) for former users, and 6.6% (3.1-13.6) for current <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When changes in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use during follow up were taken into account, the associations were strengthened: HR for oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> for current users at baseline or afterwards was 0.20 (95% CI 0.10-0.41) compared with never users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with never users, current <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> users (at baseline and follow-up) had less <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> (n=35 cases; 0.25 [0.12-0.54]) and tetraploidy (n=45 cases; 0.44 [0.22-0.87]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use might be an effective chemopreventive strategy, reducing the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
