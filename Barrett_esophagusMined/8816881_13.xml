<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Goblet cells are considered by most to be a prerequisite for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Columnar cells that are alcian blue (AB) positive (as are goblet cells) are commonly observed in the surface epithelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, but their distribution in relation to goblet cells has not previously been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors analyzed the prevalence and distribution of these cell types in the surface but not pit epithelium (where they may sometimes be present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastric mucosa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the AB-positive columnar cells was mapped out in the entire mucosa of nine esophagectomy specimens, resected for Barrett's-associated high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and compared with other cell types, especially goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AB-positive goblet and columnar cells were present in 87.1% +/- 5.6% and 85.7% +/- 5.9%, respectively, of the evaluated sections of Barrett's mucosa, whereas gastric-type, AB-negative cells were observed in 46.3% +/- 8.7% of the sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 53% of the sections, the surface epithelium contained more than 25% AB-positive cells, and in more than three quarters of these sections, AB-positive columnar cells were the dominant AB-positive cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference in the distribution of the AB-positive epithelial cells was noticed between the proximal and distal halves of the Barrett's mucosae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cardia region, seven of nine cases showed a few scattered AB-positive columnar cells, and five of nine cases showed a few scattered goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No AB-positive cells were found in fundic gland mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the metaplastic AB-positive columnar cells are more prevalent than goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They may be analogous to incomplete metaplastic cells of the stomach, and, therefore, their role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> needs further study </plain></SENT>
