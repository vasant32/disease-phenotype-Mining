<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study was formulated to assess, in human tissue, the morphological relationship between oesophageal gland ducts and both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> and their associated squamous islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial sections were cut through a total of 46 blocks of archived oesophageal resection tissue containing oesophageal gland ducts underlying Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial sections were also taken through 15 squamous islands, taken from the same archived tissue, to assess their underlying histology: 21 of the ducts opened onto overlying Barrett's epithelium; in 17 there was a relatively sharp distinction between the two cell types, at the junction, whereas in four there was continuity and a gradual morphological change between the cells of the oesophageal gland ducts and the Barrett's epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 15 squamous islands sectioned were found to be continuous with an underlying gland duct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study suggests an interrelationship between Barrett's epithelium and oesophageal gland ducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More definitively we confirm that squamous islands are universally associated with oesophageal gland duct epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings are of fundamental importance for the development of more targeted management strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
