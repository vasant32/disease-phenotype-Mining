<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cellular autofluorescence was characterized in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human esophageal cells and in malignant esophageal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was performed under excitation at 351 nm where the cell fluorescence is mainly due to the reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36980">pyridine nucleotides</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi>) with a very small contribution from the oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30527">flavins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17621">FMN</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="18" ids="16238">FAD</z:chebi>) or lipopigments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The autofluorescence emission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> on Barrett's mucosa and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells was characterized by microspectrofluorimetry on monolayers and by spectrofluorimetry on cell suspensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative contribution of each fluorophore to the fluorescence emission of the different cell types was evaluated by a curve-fitting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A statistically highly significant difference was observed between the average intensity of the raw spectra of the different cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tumoral cells had a fluorescence intensity approximately twice as high as that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> quantitation analyzed by microspectrofluorimetry on single living cells and spectrofluorimetry on cell suspensions were consistent with those obtained by biochemical cycling assays, showing that the amount of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> is higher in tumoral cells than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> concentration was found to be quite stable whatever the cell type while the amount of free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> showed a very important increase in tumoral cells </plain></SENT>
