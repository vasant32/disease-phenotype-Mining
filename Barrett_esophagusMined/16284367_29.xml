<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, a metaplastic precursor to esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, is becoming increasingly prevalent in many populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies suggest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>; however, no population-based estimates of risk have been reported, and the role of other health factors in modifying risk is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study in Brisbane, Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were 167 patients with histologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> diagnosed between February and December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-matched and sex-matched controls (n = 261) were randomly selected from a population register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on exposure to self-reported symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e>, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and other factors were collected through self-completed questionnaires followed by telephone interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> associated with these exposures were estimated by the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI), both crude and adjusted for other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Self-reported weekly episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> were associated with greatly increased risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (adjusted OR, 29.7; 95% CI, 12.2-72.6) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (OR, 59.7; 95% CI, 18.5-193) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Smoking was also associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found evidence of interactions between symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> and smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> people with self-reported symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> had markedly higher risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (OR, 34.4; 95% CI, 6.3-188) than people with reflux alone (OR, 9.3; 95% CI, 1.4-62.2) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> alone (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.2-2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, those reporting both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> symptoms and smoking were at substantially higher risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (OR, 51.4; 95% CI, 14.1-188) than those reporting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> or smoking alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although history of symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">acid reflux</z:e> is the principle factor associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, risks are substantially increased by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and smoking </plain></SENT>
