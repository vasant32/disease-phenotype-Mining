<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> (BO) and oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (OAC) can be termed the incubation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the unrecorded <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BO precludes its direct observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Determining the range of intervals between BO diagnosis and OAC within the longest observational BO follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were presence of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD) or OAC at baseline, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within &lt;2 years of BO diagnosis, oesophagectomy without HGD/OAC and loss to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 133 patients (M/F 73/60) were taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 1967 person years of follow-up there were 13 cases of HGD/OAC, (0.66% p.a.; 95% CI 0.58-0.74), 96 patients died without HGD/OAC and 24 survived without HGD/OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean intervals between BO diagnosis and either HGD/OAC, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or end of follow-up were 10.8, 12.6 and 25.5 years, respectively, and the mean ages at endpoint were 72.5, 80.0 and 68.3 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The survivors without HGD/OAC had a lower age at BO diagnosis (mean 42.8 vs 61.2 and 67.4 years, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline presence of low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was associated with progression to HGD/OAC (log rank P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Rotterdam BO follow-up cohort revealed a long incubation period between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BO and development of HGD/OAC, in patients without HGD/OAC at baseline as illustrated by 24 patients diagnosed with BO at a young age and followed for a mean period of 25.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-free survival established a minimum incubation period, suggesting a true incubation period of three decades or more </plain></SENT>
