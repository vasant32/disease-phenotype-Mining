<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several immunohistochemical studies showed that p53 protein is expressed in 50 to 80% of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (EAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene are present in 40 to 70% of EAs, so it is possible that p53 expression might occur as a result of mechanisms other than gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human homologue of the murine double minute-2 gene (mdm-2) is a known regulator of p53 activity, and its expression results in stabilization of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 protein and loss of its <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the frequency of mdm-2 amplification and expression in EA and investigated the relationship between mdm-2 expression and p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three resection specimens of EAs and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> were evaluated by immunohistochemical methods for p53 and mdm-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of these cases were also evaluated for p53 mutations with use of polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformational polymorphism, and DNA sequencing and for mdm-2 amplification with a differential polymerase chain reaction-based amplification analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of p53 was present in 23 EAs (70%), and 18 EAs (55%) overexpressed mdm-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>p53 mutation was observed in 7 (43%) of 16 cases, whereas mdm-2 gene amplification was not detected in any </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To summarize, we found substantial discordance of p53 immunohistochemical features and mutation in EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant expression of mdm-2 occurred only in cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases with p53 mutation showed little if any expression of mdm-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, mdm-2 expression in cases with p53 overexpression but without p53 mutation exceeded mdm-2 expression in cases with p53 overexpression and p53 gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In cases without p53 mutation, overexpression of mdm-2 occurred in 50% of cases and might be responsible for stabilization of p53 protein and possible loss of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor function </plain></SENT>
