<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess risk factors for reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1,495 Japanese subjects undergoing health checkups (822 males and 673 females; median age 50 years) at a tertiary care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-seven subjects (8%) had reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> was observed in 292 subjects (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> (13 vs. 3%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (28 vs. 9%) were more frequent in males than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in clinical backgrounds were observed between females and males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (OR 6.63, 95% CI 2.47-17.8; p = 0.0002) was associated with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In males, age (per 1-year increment: OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.99; p = 0.007), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (OR 3.16, 95% CI 2.05-4.87; p &lt; 0.0001) and waist circumference (per 1-cm increase: OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.15; p = 0.006) were associated with reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> may be an important risk factor for reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in males compared with females </plain></SENT>
