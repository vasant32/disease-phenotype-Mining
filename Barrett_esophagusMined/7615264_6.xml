<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eighteen patients with a minimum age of 20 who were diagnosed as having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> in childhood were interviewed; <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> meal examination was performed in 96 of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety four patients had not required surgery for their <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> persisted in 53% of these patients and 46% experienced heartburn at least monthly but in only three was this severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heartburn was significantly more common in patients in whom reflux was seen on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The consumption of antacids was significantly lower (20% v 46%) in patients who responded well to treatment as children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 24 patients who underwent surgery as children experienced heart-burn monthly but in only one patient was this severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent endoscopy at their request because of symptoms during this follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, despite the persistence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> in half of the non-surgically treated patients, few complained of significant symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Effective treatment in childhood was associated with a significant reduction in antacid consumption for heartburn as adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The finding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> in two patients high-lights a possible role for endoscopic screening in this patient group </plain></SENT>
