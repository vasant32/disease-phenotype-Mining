<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether endoscopic evaluation of patients referred for liver transplant evaluation contributes significantly to patient selection or management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed in transplant candidates who had not undergone this examination within a previous 6-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy (CSP) was performed if the patient was &gt;50 yr of age or had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, a history of colonic pathology such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath>, or a history suggesting gastrointestinal tract abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EGD was performed in 74 (63%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo> identified; in 26, this represented a new diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other findings on EGD included portal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastropathy</z:e> (21 patients), gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> (seven patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PUD|pud|GDU">peptic ulceration</z:e> (10 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (three patients), and one case each of esophageal and gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CSP was performed in 56 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Findings included <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> (24 patients) and one case of colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, gastrointestinal pathology was discovered in 67 (57%) of the patients undergoing endoscopic evaluation as part of our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alterations in patient selection or management resulted from 44% of the procedures performed; 42% of the patients were affected by these management changes and 2.5% of patients were removed from further transplant evaluation because of the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endoscopic evaluation of liver transplant candidates often identifies important gastrointestinal pathology and frequently impacts patient selection and management before OLT </plain></SENT>
