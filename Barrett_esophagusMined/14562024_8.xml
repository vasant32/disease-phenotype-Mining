<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and timing of SPARC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in Barrett's multistage disease and to investigate the impact of SPARC alterations on the development and progression of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPARC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was measured using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR method in 108 specimens from 19 patients with BE without <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, 20 patients with Barrett's-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EA), and a control group (CG) of 10 patients without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median SPARC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly upregulated in BE tissues compared to paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oesophagus (NE) tissues for the BE group (P=0.004) and for the EA group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SPARC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the oesophagus compared to matching NE tissue and compared to Barrett's tissues in the EA group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SPARC expression values were significantly different between metaplastic and dysplastic Barrett's tissues (P=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In histologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> squamous oesophagus tissues obtained from <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients (EA group), the SPARC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly higher compared to NE mucosa from the BE group and the CG group (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the upregulation of SPARC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression is an early event in the development and progression of BE and EA, and that high SPARC expression may be a clinically useful biomarker for the detection of occult <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and that a widespread 'field effect' is present in the NE of patients with oesophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
