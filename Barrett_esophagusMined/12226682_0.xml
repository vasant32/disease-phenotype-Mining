<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The issue of whether to screen individuals for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (BE) to prevent esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (EAC) is highly controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Important considerations are that BE is not highly prevalent in the general population and that not many patients with BE develop or die from EAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies that suggest an improved prognosis from surveillance programs are susceptible to lead-time bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the principles for effective screening, as outlined by the World Health Organization, are not met by endoscopic screening and surveillance protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of BE (and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) is often unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients with BE are not identified by screening, and few <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> would be prevented by surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A decision analysis found that the most cost effective screening protocol would be every five years, but the costs associated with prolongation of life are very high, even if a group at high risk for EAC could be identified </plain></SENT>
