<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is an effective tool to screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of the digestive tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, access to endoscopy is limited in many parts of South Carolina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This trial is a part of a prospective multi-part study for remote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening in coastal South Carolina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pilot study was to evaluate the quality of tele-endoscopy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 10 patients scheduled for endoscopic procedures were observed simultaneously by the endoscopist and a remote observer connected over a 512 kbps ISDN line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings by both were compared for concordance on malignant or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The image quality was adequate to support remote diagnosis of GI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and abnormal lesions by an experienced observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, assessment of the esophagogastric junction for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> was equivocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our tele-endoscopy setup shows great promise for remote supervision or observation of endoscopic procedures done by nurse endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tele-endoscopy is both adequate and feasible for diagnosis of most gastrointestinal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subtle lesions still may be missed in our current setup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, improvements are being made in our setup to address the problem with resolution prior to further evaluation </plain></SENT>
