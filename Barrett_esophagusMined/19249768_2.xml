<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current investigations into endoscopic screening for the early detection of Barrett's esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> have focused on visualization of the microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> by using narrow-band imaging (NBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adjustment of the center wavelength, particularly of the NBI blue imaging filter, may lead to improved image contrast, depending on the oxygen saturation of the microvascular blood of dysplastic and early cancerous Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To perform in vivo, noninvasive measurements of the oxygen saturation of the microvascular blood for different pathologic grades of Barrett's mucosa by using differential path-length spectroscopy (DPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: DPS measurements were made on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 7), low-grade dysplastic (n = 10), high-grade dysplastic (n = 7), and cancerous (n = 4) Barrett's mucosa by using a fiber-optic probe, and were correlated to the histologic outcome of biopsy specimens taken from the same location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> who were undergoing gastroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Biopsy specimens were taken from suspicious areas in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The oxygen saturation of the microvascular blood of different pathologic grades of Barrett's mucosa was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The oxygen saturation of the microvascular blood remains high (approximately 90%) throughout the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: The small number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current NBI blue imaging filter, centered on the peak absorption of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (415 nm), is well chosen, and little improvement in image contrast is to be expected from changes in this center wavelength </plain></SENT>
