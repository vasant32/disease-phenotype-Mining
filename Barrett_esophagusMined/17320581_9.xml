<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The reasons for the increasing incidence of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A causal relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Support for this comes from the development of esophageal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in the rat reflux model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, to date, no systematic characterization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> derived from this model has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We induced biliary reflux by creating esophagojejunal anastomoses in 12 Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The experiment was terminated at 9 months, and rat esophagi were harvested for histopathologic documentation of reflux-associated changes and evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three cell lines were established from 2 of the reflux-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We tested the ability of these cells to grow in vitro in tissue culture and in vivo as xenografts in an orthotopic location at the gastroesophageal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we performed a cytogenetic analysis and determined the array-based gene expression profiles of these 3 rodent <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> lines compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> esophageal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 9 months, 12 of 12 rodents had histologic features of metaplastic columnar epithelium in the esophagus, with 7 having invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> with glandular differentiation (either <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> or adenosquamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 3 cell lines established from 2 reflux-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were capable of sustained in vitro propagation and grew successfully as xenografts in both subcutaneous and orthotopic locations, confirming the tumorigenic nature of these lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite their establishment from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> with glandular features, the histology of the xenografts was that of well-differentiated squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analyses demonstrated cytogenetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>; furthermore, translocation (7:11) was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Array-based gene expression profiling confirmed upregulation of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes important in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the differential expression of selected transcripts (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], polo-like kinases [PLK], cyclin dependent kinase 4 [CDK4], <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor 1alpha [HIF1alpha], and insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1]) in comparison with nonneoplastic esophageal mucosal scrapings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rodent reflux model is capable of inducing metaplastic epithelial changes simulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, as well as subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e>, at a high frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cell lines have been established from these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that are capable of in vitro and in vivo passaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The rodent reflux model should be a valuable model for studying therapy and chemoprevention efforts for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo>, whereas the established cell lines provide a useful resource for drug discovery and other high-throughput studies </plain></SENT>
