<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial length of Barrett's epithelium ranged from 1 to 16 cm, mean 5.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specialized columnar epithelium was present in 64 of the 67 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated predominantly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37961">H2-receptor blocker</z:chebi> therapy to relieve symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two percent of patients had less than a 1-cm change in length per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean rate of change of length was -0.093 cm per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results confirm in a relatively large, prospective study that standard antireflux therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> does not result in consistent reduction in the extent of Barrett's epithelium over a three-year interval </plain></SENT>
