<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to assess accuracy and interrater reliability of microendoscopists in identifying Barrett's-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> using HRME images, we recruited 20 gastroenterologists with no microendoscopic experience and three expert microendoscopists in a large academic hospital in New York City to interpret HRME images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They prospectively reviewed 40 HRME images from 28 consecutive patients undergoing surveillance for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and/or evaluation for high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Images were reviewed in a blinded fashion, after a 4-minute training with 11 representative images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> imaged sites were biopsied and interpreted by an expert pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> endoscopists for identification of high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-0.92) and specificity was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.79-0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive and negative predictive values were 0.72 (95% CI: 0.68-0.77) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92-0.96), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in accuracy were observed between experts and novices (0.90 vs. 0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The kappa statistic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> raters was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.54-0.58), and the difference between groups was not significant (0.64 vs. 0.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that gastroenterologists can diagnose Barrett's-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> on HRME images with high sensitivity and specificity, without the aid of prior microendoscopy experience </plain></SENT>
