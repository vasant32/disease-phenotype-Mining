<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increase in damage points to reduced repair capacity and risk for progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used the comet assay to assess DNA damage in individuals with various disorders of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract in a cohort of patients from South India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After thorough clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological evaluation, patients were categorized into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, precancers, inflammatory pathologies, and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results from the comet assay performed on esophageal tissue cells and blood from the same patients showed good correlation of damage in the paired samples; subsequent assays were performed in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was more DNA damage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in damage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (37%) and precancers (30.7%) when compared with the inflammatory pathologies (15.6%) and controls (10.03%) was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interindividual variation observed was independent of confounding factors such as tobacco and alcohol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the damage seen in the esophageal tissue is likely to be disease-related, whereas that seen in blood may be a reflection of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individuals with greater damage may be prone to disease progression and the comet assay can be used as a cost-effective biomonitoring tool to assess damage and identify these individuals at risk for a progressive pathology, even to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
