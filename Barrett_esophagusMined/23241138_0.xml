<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When diagnosed early, however, the combination of surgery and adjuvant therapies is associated with high cure rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Metabolomics provides a means for non- invasive screening of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated perturbations in cellular metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Urine samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011459'>esophageal carcinoma</z:hpo> (n = 44), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> (n = 31), and healthy controls (n = 75) were examined using (1)H-NMR spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Targeted profiling of spectra using Chenomx software permitted quantification of 66 distinct metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised (principal component analysis) and supervised (orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis OPLS-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) multivariate pattern recognition techniques were applied to discriminate between samples using SIMCA-P(+) software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Model specificity was also confirmed through comparison with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> cohort (n = 32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clear distinctions between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and healthy controls were noted when OPLS-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Model validity was confirmed using two established methods of internal validation, cross-validation and response permutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of the multivariate OPLS-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> models were summarized using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and revealed excellent predictive power (area under the curve = 0.9810 and 0.9627 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The metabolite expression profiles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> were also clearly distinguishable with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) = 0.8954 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Urinary metabolomics identified discrete metabolic signatures that clearly distinguished both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The metabolite expression profile of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> was also discrete from its precursor lesion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific nature of this profile was confirmed through comparison with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results suggest that urinary metabolomics may have a future potential role in non-invasive screening in these conditions </plain></SENT>
