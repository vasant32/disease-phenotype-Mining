<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We postulated that a first early course of ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> would increase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> IX (PPIX) accumulation and thus the efficacy of a second course of ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, by manipulating ferrochelatase (FC) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17381">porphobilinogen</z:chebi> deaminase (PBG-d) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells were used as a model of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells for the ability to form haem is present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a single course of illumination (633 nm, 100 mW/cm2) the FC activity decreased significantly whereas the PBG-d activity did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During continued incubation with ALA following the first illumination, cells accumulated up to four times more PPIX than non-illuminated controls [220% +/- 30% versus (vs) 55% +/- 5%; p&lt;0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two illuminations resulted in more cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than one illumination (97% +/- 1% vs 80% +/- 2%; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since a second course of ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> within 3 hr after the first course resulted in a four fold increase in PPIX accumulation and significantly more cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, we propose that a two course ALA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> scheme might improve the efficacy of this treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's oesophagus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
