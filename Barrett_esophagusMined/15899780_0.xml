<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated serial step sections from 261 esophageal or gastroesophageal junction biopsies at 4 levels to determine the first level at which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_166'>goblet cell metaplasia</z:mpath> (GCM) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deeper step sections of 152 paraffin blocks also were obtained to determine whether additional sections are useful in detecting GCM not seen in initial levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GCM was identified in 95.3% of blocks in 3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GCM was seen at level 4 in 12 blocks (4.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the blocks that did not reveal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_167'>intestinal metaplasia</z:mpath> in the initial 4 levels, deeper sections disclosed GCM in only 1 (0.8%) of 120 blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, deeper sections revealed initially undetected GCM in 4 of 32 blocks from patients with a history of documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 4 levels of step sections are adequate in routine processing of esophageal biopsy specimens for demonstration of GCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deeper sections may be obtained for patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett esophagus</z:hpo> to better evaluate for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or find additional foci of GCM </plain></SENT>
