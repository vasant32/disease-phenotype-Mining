<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a novel Fourier-domain angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry (aâ€‰/LCI) fiber probe designed for in vivo clinical application in gastrointestinal endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The a/LCI technique measures the depth-resolved angular scattering distribution to determine the size distribution and optical density of cell nuclei for assessing the health of epithelial tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical application is enabled by an endoscopic fiber-optic probe that employs a 2.3-m-long coherent fiber bundle and is compatible with the standard 2.8-mm-diam biopsy channel of a gastroscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probe allows for real-time data acquisition by collecting the scattering from multiple angles in parallel, enabled by the Fourier domain approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The performance of the probe is characterized through measurement of critical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The depth-resolved sizing capability of the system is demonstrated using single- and double-layer microsphere phantoms with subwavelength sizing precision and accuracy achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial results from a clinical feasibility test are also presented to show in vivo application in the human esophagus </plain></SENT>
