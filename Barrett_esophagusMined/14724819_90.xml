<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to describe the prevalence of BE in a volunteer population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Upper endoscopy (EGD) was performed in 961 persons with no prior history of EGD who were scheduled for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptom questionnaires were completed prior to endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were taken from the gastric cardia and any columnar mucosa extending &gt; or =5 mm into the tubular esophagus and from the stomach for H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the last 812 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study sample was biased toward persons undergoing colonoscopy, males, and persons with upper GI symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BE was 65 of 961 (6.8%) patients, including 12 (1.2%) with long-segment BE (LSBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 556 subjects who had never had heartburn, the prevalences of BE and LSBE were 5.6% and 0.36%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 384 subjects with a history of any heartburn, the prevalences of BE and LSBE were 8.3% and 2.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis, LSBE was more common in those with any heartburn vs. those with no heartburn (P = 0.01), but the sample size was insufficient to allow multivariate analysis of predictors of LSBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, BE was associated with increasing age (P = 0.02), white race (P = 0.03), and negative H. pylori status (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, BE was not associated with heartburn, although heartburn was more common in persons with LSBE or circumferential short segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LSBE is very uncommon in patients who have no history of heartburn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SSBE is relatively common in persons age &gt; or =40 years with no prior endoscopy, irrespective of heartburn history </plain></SENT>
