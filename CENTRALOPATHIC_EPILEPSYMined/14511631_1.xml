<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the literature there has often been misconceptions in the description of the syndrome, and the affinity to related conditions and structural abnormalities with rolandic discharges is often unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> regarding the definition and delineation of RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A spectrum of RE based on a maturational continuum is possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Until more is known about the genetic background of RE, a simple classification is proposed: 1) RE "pure" according to the original definition; 2) RE "plus"; 3) RE-related disorders; 4) Structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> with signs and symptoms as in RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A summary of results from neuroimaging, neuropsychological and oromotor studies in RE "pure" is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accurate clinical assessment and EEG analysis is essential for a proper classification of RE </plain></SENT>
