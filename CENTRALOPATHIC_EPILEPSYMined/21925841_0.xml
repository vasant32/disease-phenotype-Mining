<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathological basis of this syndrome is completely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We postulated that a developmental abnormality presumably results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> background activity findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 children with typical BERS and an age- and sex-matched group of healthy control children underwent EEG recording and analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>60Ã—2 s epochs of waking EEG background activity (without epileptiform potentials and artifacts) were analyzed in the 1-25 Hz frequency range, in very narrow bands (VNB, 1 Hz bandwidth) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LORETA (Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography) localized multiple distributed sources of EEG background activity in the Talairach space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LORETA activity (current source density) was computed for 2394 voxels and 25 VNBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Normalized LORETA data were processed to voxel-wise comparison between the BERS and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bonferroni-corrected p&lt;0.05 Student's t-values were accepted as statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased LORETA activity was found in the BERS group (as compared to the controls) in the left and right temporal lobes (fusiform gyri, posterior parts of the superior, middle and inferior temporal gyri) and in the angular gyri in the parietal lobes, in the 4-6 Hz VNBs, mainly at 5 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: (1) Areas of abnormal LORETA activity exactly correspond to the temporal and parietal cortical areas that are major components of the Mirsky attention model and also the perisylvian speech network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus the LORETA findings may correspond to impaired attention and speech in BERS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(2) The LORETA findings may contribute to delineating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> network in BERS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: The novel findings may contribute to investigating neuropsychological disturbances and organization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> network in BERS </plain></SENT>
