<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Children with electroclinical criteria of PS were prospectively identified and followed-up clinically, and with sleep and awake EEGs between February 1990 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 192 patients with PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the same length of time 398 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes</z:e> (BCECTS) were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PS had a peak age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autonomic manifestations were one of the most common ictal event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ictal deviation of the eyes and progression to generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> were also quite frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately one third had partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except five, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> occurred during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-third also had fits while awake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen children had concomitant symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> and eight developed rolandic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> after remission of PS <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four (44.2%) had a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, 79 (41.2%) had 2-5 fits, and 28 (14.6%) had frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PS is less common than BCECTS, but is well defined and easily recognizable by clinical and EEG features, with autonomic manifestations as one of the most common ictal event </plain></SENT>
