<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To emphasize that, in some patients, different atypical evolutions occur in the course of so-called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270847" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">benign focal epilepsies of childhood</z:e> (BFEC) and to promote interest in finding clinical and/or electroencephalographic (EEG) clues to which patients might be prone to these risky evolutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six patients who started with the typical clinical and EEG features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BCECTS) but who had reversible or persistent, serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> events including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> and language, cognitive, or behavioral impairments were followed for &lt;/=14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeated neurologic examinations, EEG records, and neuropsychological evaluations were done, and brain-imaging studies [computerized axial tomography (CAT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 26 patients were in four separate groups according to the nature of their atypical evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven children had atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270847" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">benign focal epilepsy of childhood</z:e> (ABFEC), three with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282512" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="LKS">Landau-Kleffner syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e>), seven with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> of BCECTS, and five with mixed features of the other three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the children whose BCECTS evolved into ABFEC have finally recovered and are attending <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> schools, although five have learning difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e> recovered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, although some language difficulties persist in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The seven who showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> of BCECTS are now <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after 3-14 years of follow-up, and three of the five children showing mixed features fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep (CSWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A small proportion of cases starting with BCECTS evolve into ABFEC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e>, status of BCECTS, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with CSWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In such cases, BCECTS is not always benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical and EEG markers should be sought to predict these atypical evolutions </plain></SENT>
