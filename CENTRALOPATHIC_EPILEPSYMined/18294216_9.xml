<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also aimed to define the possible electroclinical markers of specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunctions</z:e> in RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>School abilities were evaluated and compared in 20 children (eight males, 12 females; mean age 10y 3mo [SD 1y 7mo]; range 7y 9mo-12y 9mo) consecutively diagnosed with typical RE, and a group of 21 healthy controls (nine males, 12 females; mean age 10y 4mo [SD 1y 8mo]; range 7y 6mo-13y 3mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the children received standardized neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each patient an exhaustive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> diary was kept and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific difficulties with reading, writing, and calculation (diagnosed according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, 4th edition) were found in nine out of 20 children with RE and two out of 21 healthy controls (chi2=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001328'>specific learning disabilities</z:hpo> in the RE group were correlated with a marked increase in epileptiform discharges during sleep (chi2=0.02) and an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (chi2=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before age 8 years and epileptiform discharges (more than 50% of the sleep EEG recording) in several tracings over more than a year are relevant markers for identifying patients at risk of developing academic difficulties </plain></SENT>
