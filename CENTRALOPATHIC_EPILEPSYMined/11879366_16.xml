<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although remission is the ultimate measure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndrome should largely determine this outcome, little is known about the relative importance of syndrome versus other factors traditionally examined as predictors of remission or of relapse after remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine remission and relapse with respect to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndrome and other factors traditionally considered with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospectively identified cohort of 613 children with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was assembled and is actively being followed to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> syndrome and etiology were classified at diagnosis and again 2 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remission was defined as 2 years completely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free, and relapse as the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> after remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis was performed with the Cox proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-four of the original 613 children were followed &gt; or = 2 years (median follow-up, 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remission occurred in 442 (74%), of whom 107 (24%) relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariable analysis, idiopathic generalized syndromes and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> between 5 and 9 years were associated with a substantially increased remission rate, whereas remote symptomatic etiology, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency, and slowing on the initial EEG were associated with a decreased likelihood of attaining remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Young <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age (&lt;1 year) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> type were not important after adjustment for these predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relapses occurred more often in association with focal slowing on the initial EEG and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270853" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="JME|EJM">juvenile myoclonic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> and age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> &lt;1 year were associated with markedly lower risks of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>About one fourth of relapses were apparently spontaneous while the child was taking medication with good compliance, and more than half occurred in children who were tapering or had fully stopped medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> remit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic etiology, family history, EEG slowing, and initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency negatively influence, and age 5-9 years and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270850" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IGE|EIG">idiopathic generalized epilepsy</z:e> positively influence the probability of entering remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Factors that most influence relapse tend to be different from those that influence remission </plain></SENT>
