<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, neuropsychological deficits have been noted in affected children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As Rolandic discharges are mainly distributed over the centrotemporal region, specific interference with language function might be suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conducted a standardized neuropsychological assessment in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> which covered <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> important aspects of language processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured intelligence Quotient, verbal memory, auditory discrimination, vocabulary, grammar and literacy in 20 children with an active Rolandic focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information about performance at school was obtained from teachers by means of a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> failed five of the twelve standardized language tests significantly more often than the normative population and consequently showed impairment of the following functions: reading, spelling, auditory verbal learning, auditory discrimination with background noise and expressive grammar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 20 children showed language dysfunction with difficulties in two or more of the twelve standardized language tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In eight of these 13 children the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient was within average range, indicating a specific language deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Language dysfunction was closely associated with learning difficulties at school </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study documents a consistent pattern of language dysfunction in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> which suggests interictal dysfunction of perisylvian language areas </plain></SENT>
