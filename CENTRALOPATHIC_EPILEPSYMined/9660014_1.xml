<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed topographic EEG investigation with instant voltage mapping in 57 patients with a Rolandic spike focus including 35 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pronounced maximal negativity of "Rolandic" spikes could be demonstrated over central or mid-temporal electrodes, with a spread to parietal or upper frontal areas with a dipole formation (centrotemporal negativity, frontal positivity) and involvement of midline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a moderate correlation between spike amplitude or duration with spread to adjacent areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No other focal abnormalities such as focal slowing could be revealed by visual or FFT EEG analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During light sleep spike activity was pronounced and often associated with generalized spike wave activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, a functional disturbance rather than a structural lesion can be assumed </plain></SENT>
