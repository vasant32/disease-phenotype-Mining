<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a whole-scalp magnetoencephalography (MEG), we recorded scalp EEG and MEG signals in 10 BRE patients (age 8-12 years) and visually identified unilateral interictal spikes that were simultaneously present on both EEG and MEG channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We obtained the peak timing of individual spike complex based on MEG single-dipole modeling, and then applied wavelet transform to analyze the time-frequency components of corresponding MEG signals with respect to spike occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the hemisphere with time-domain spike waveforms, we identified a clear increase of 0.5-40 Hz activity around the spike peak, most prominent at alpha band (8-13 Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, at the approximate timing we also observed an increase in 0.5-25 Hz oscillations over the homotopic area in the other hemisphere where no spike signals were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate bilateral increases in 0.5-25 Hz oscillations during unilateral spike formation in BRE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By using wavelet transform analysis, one could be able to detect some irritative feature that would in visual analysis remain undetected </plain></SENT>
