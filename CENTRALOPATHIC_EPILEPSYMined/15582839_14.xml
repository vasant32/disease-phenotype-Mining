<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial investigation reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in memory and learning of auditory-verbal material together with executive functions compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the second assessment, the ability for immediate memory, memory and learning of visuospatial as well as auditory-verbal material and delayed recall was the same in the RE group as in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On one of the tests measuring executive functions, Verbal Fluency, the RE group scored significantly lower than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With respect to reading and writing ability, the children with RE had some difficulty with word comprehension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonverbal reasoning was the same in the two groups, as was general IQ </plain></SENT>
