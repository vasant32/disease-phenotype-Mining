<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Among the different kinds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> there is a form of benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centrotemporal spikes (BECT) presenting the peculiar characteristic of evoking rolandic paroxysmal activity, characterized by a spike followed by a slow wave, using electrical stimulation of the fingers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 7 patients suffering from BECT presenting evoked scalp activity by electrical stimulation of the fingers of the hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrical stimulation was performed using a pair of ring electrodes applied to the thumb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The motor evoked potentials (<z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEPs</z:chebi>) were elicited in hand muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and were conditioned by the same electrical digital stimulation producing the evoked spikes at interstimulus intervals ranging from 10 to 200 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Digital stimulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> patients produced an increase in <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> amplitude substantially above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> facilitation showed a time course overlapping the ascending phase and peak of the evoked spike, whereas no significant <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> changes were found during the early positive peak and the descending phase of the spike, or during the following slow wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several considerations support the hypothesis that the short-lasting M1 facilitation is related to the spread of an abnormal hypersynchronous discharge of the S1 neurones to functionally related motor areas via cortico-cortical connections </plain></SENT>
