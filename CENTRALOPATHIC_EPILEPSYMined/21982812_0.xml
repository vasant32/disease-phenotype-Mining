<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Out of the 148 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> reviewed from January 2005 to June 2010 in our Institute, there were seven (5%) with atonic-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent video EEG, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuropsychological evaluation and language assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their progress was followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9925">sodium valproate</z:chebi>, three were treated with steroids, followed by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> relapsed while tapering or after stopping the steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the children had earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (mean=2.4 years), increased frequency and increased duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>focal seizures</z:hpo> compared to typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Head drop and truncal sway due to axial or axiorhizomelic atonia occurring several times per day or week was the key manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0010819'>atonic seizures</z:hpo> worsened with carbamazepine in three, clonazepam in two and clobazam in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> commenced, some children developed one or more of the following problems: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit</z:hpo>, clumsy gait, and mild cognitive or language dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three children became <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free, one on steroids and the other two on IVIG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> in children with an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and frequent and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> is more likely to evolve into atonic-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Carbamazepine and some <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi> may worsen these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three children became <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free with immunomodulatory therapy, one on steroids and the other two on IVIG, and had complete resolution of the transient motor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Atonic-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> needs to be differentiated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lennox-Gastaut syndrome</z:e> since it is potentially treatable and children recover with no sequel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the children in this series continued to be on treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9925">sodium valproate</z:chebi> it is currently undetermined whether they would have required to do so if followed up for an extended period of time </plain></SENT>
