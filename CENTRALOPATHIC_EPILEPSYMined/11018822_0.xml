<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the number of cases with reported organic lesions has been increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This led to the creation of two subgroups, "benign" and "non benign" BRE, and resulted in the need for additional parameters to define electrographic benignity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the possible associations between interictal electroencephalographic findings and clinical behavior in 60 BRE cases, testing four parameters of electrographic benignity (paroxysm <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, horizontal dipole, base rhythms, laterality of rolandic spikes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the relationship between neuroimaging findings and electrographic and clinical classifications, and found a statistically significant association (sensitivity=73.5%; specificity=81.8%; positive predictive value=94 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>8%; negative predictive value=40.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the electrographic parameters proposed were associated with clinical classification: paroxysm <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, horizontal dipole, and base rhythms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases electrographically classified as benign have 21 times more chances to be equally classified as clinically benign according with the tested criteria </plain></SENT>
