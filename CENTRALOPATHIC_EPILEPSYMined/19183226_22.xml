<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These regions also underlie executive functioning, although their relationship has yet to be examined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the relationship between thalamic and frontal volumes and executive function in recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JME</z:e> compared to healthy control subjects and recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BCECTS), a syndrome not typically associated with thalamocortical or executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty children with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JME</z:e> were compared to 51 healthy controls and 12 children with BCECTS using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and measures of executive abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative thalamic and frontal volumes were obtained through semi-automated software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subtests from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) were used to measure executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Executive functions were impaired in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JME</z:e> subjects compared to control and BCECTS subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JME</z:e> had significantly smaller thalamic volumes and more frontal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than control and BCECTS subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thalamic and frontal volumes were significantly related to executive functioning in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JME</z:e> group, but not in the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JME</z:e> have significant executive dysfunction associated with significantly smaller thalami and more frontal CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Children with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> BCECTS do not display the same pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Frontal and thalamic volumes appear to mediate the relationship between executive functioning and brain structure in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
