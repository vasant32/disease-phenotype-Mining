<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> tend to occur more often during sleep or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to some authors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> prevail over other types particularly among children aged five or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to determine the characteristics of the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> episode among children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, grouped by age as of their first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, as well as to analyze how such <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> change over the course of clinical evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 61 children were examined, 16 of whom below the age of 5 and 45 above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With regard to the first and recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> episodes, our final assessment showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>partial seizures</z:hpo> occurred more frequently than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic-clonic seizures</z:hpo> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although no conclusive relation could be established between the type of partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (i.e. simple versus complex) and the children's age as of their first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> episode, it was possible to correlate the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> with their clinical evolution, in which case <z:hpo ids='HP_0002349'>simple partial seizures</z:hpo> proved to be more frequent than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002384'>complex partial seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the number of children under the age of five was relatively small, which evidences the need for further studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should also be borne in mind that the reported frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> in these children's first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> episode may be due to their parents' lack of attention and familiarity with this pathology and their attendant difficulty in characterizing its clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
