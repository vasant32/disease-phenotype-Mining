<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In a previous study, we reported hippocampal abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in six of 18 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (RE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, metabolic changes were analyzed in the hippocampal region with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 13 children with electroclinically typical RE and 15 healthy controls, 1H-MRS results of both hippocampal regions were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The voxels, 2 x 2 x 4-cm each, were placed to include the head and body of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A PRESS sequence with TR 2,000 ms and TE 32 ms was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), glutamine and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (Glx), and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> compounds (tCho) were related to total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (tCr), and asymmetry indices (AIs) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 patients and in 13 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The tNAA/tCr AI of the hippocampal region was significantly higher in children with RE than in control children (z = 4.49; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The AIs of Glx/tCr and tCho/tCr did not show a significant difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lateralization of the interictal epileptiform activity corresponded with the lower tNAA/tCr ratio in 10 of 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed a hippocampal asymmetry in four of 13 in the RE group, three of them showed concordance between the lateralization of the lower tNAA/tCr ratio and the smaller hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the control group, a subtle asymmetry in four of 13 children was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant asymmetry of the hippocampal regions, measured by tNAA/tCr ratios, indicates an abnormal neuronal function in children with RE </plain></SENT>
