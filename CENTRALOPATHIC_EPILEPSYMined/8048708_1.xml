<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Then we selected 6 untreated and 28 treated patients from the same series who had been free from attacks for more than 2 years to determine whether the mode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or isolated one for the first month of the illness) was related to the duration of active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This comparative study of untreated and treated patients followed for 2 years revealed no differences in the interval between first visit and start of attack-free period between the two groups </plain></SENT>
