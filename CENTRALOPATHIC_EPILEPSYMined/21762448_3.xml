<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We explored high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in scalp sleep electroencephalography (EEG) studies of patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e> (IPE) of childhood in order to obtain a better understanding of the pathologic mechanisms underlying IPE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 45 patients, including 32 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BCECTS) and 13 with Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 136 EEG records were investigated through temporal expansion and filtering of traces and time-frequency spectral analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: HFOs with frequency of 93.8-152.3 Hz (mean 126.2 Â± 13.6 Hz) in the band of ripples were detected in association with spikes in 97 records (71.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time from last <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> to the EEG recording was significantly shorter in those with spike-related HFOs than in the EEG recordings with spikes without HFOs (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although time from last <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> reflects age, age at the time of recording was not significantly different between EEG studies with and without HFOs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peak-power values of the high-frequency spots in time-frequency spectra were significantly negatively correlated with time from last <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (R(2) = 0.122, p &lt; 0.001) but not with age at the time of recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peak frequencies of the high-frequency spectral spots were not significantly correlated with age at the time of recording or with time from last <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: The close relationship between the generation of spike-related HFOs and the period of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> occurrence indicated that HFOs may tell us more about epileptogenicity in IPE than the spikes themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because there is a spectrum of pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic disorders</z:e> extending from the benign end of BCECTS to the encephalopathic end of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393713" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy with continuous spike-waves during slow-wave sleep</z:e> (CSWS), and HFOs that have already been detected in association with CSWS were more prominent than HFOs in IPE, intense spike-related HFOs may indicate poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
