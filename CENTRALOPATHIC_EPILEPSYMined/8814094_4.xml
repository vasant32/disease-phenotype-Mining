<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The main purpose of this prospective study was to analyze whether 1 year of treatment was as effective as 3 years with respect to remission rate in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0391957" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">idiopathic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was started in 207 children aged 2-16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were randomized to treatment for 1 or 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of the predetermined treatment period, 161 children had been <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free for 6 months and the treatment could be gradually withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall remission rate in our group of patients was significantly higher (71%) in the group treated for 3 years than in the group treated for 1 year (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, comparison of remission rates between patients with different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types showed statistically significant differences in outcome depending on duration of treatment only in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002384'>complex partial seizures</z:hpo> (CPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that 1 year of treatment can be recommended in children with benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e> with rolandic spikes (BECT) and in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002349'>simple partial seizures</z:hpo> (SPS) but is clearly insufficient in children with CPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A proper <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> classification is one important tool, although not sufficient, in offering recommendations concerning the duration of treatment in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0391957" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">idiopathic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
