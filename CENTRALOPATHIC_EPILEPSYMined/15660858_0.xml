<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: High-frequency oscillations (HFO) ranging between 300-900 Hz have been shown to be superimposed on an early component of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) to median nerve stimulation in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the HFO are speculated to be a localized activity of the GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, the significance in the epileptogenicity remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors of this study analyzed HFO using magnetoencephalography in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (BRE) to clarify the neurophysio-logical basis of rolandic discharges (RD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with BRE and six patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> syndrome (non-BRE) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory evoked fields (SEF) including HFO to median nerve stimulation were measured in a magnetically shielded room with a 37-channel neuromagnetometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two kinds of HFO, 300 Hz- and 600 Hz-HFO, were identified and the duration of the HFO in patients with BRE was significantly longer than that in patients with non-BRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the longer part of HFO (P30m-related) is closely related to the pathogenesis of RD and that the longer HFO in patients with BRE might be mediated by altered GABAergic inhibition modulated by the cholinergic system </plain></SENT>
