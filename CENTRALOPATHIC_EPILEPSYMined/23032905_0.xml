<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 20 newly diagnosed untreated, 23 treated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, and 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders as a comparison group (aged 6-11 years) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evaluation was performed using the Lithuanian version of the Child Behavior Checklist (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Schooling parameters, clinical parameters, EEG parameters, and their relation to the results of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e> were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> had significantly higher scores in the subscales of Social Problems, Anxious/Depressed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>Aggressive Behavior</z:hpo>, and Attention Problems compared with the scores of the patients with peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship was established between the scores of native language grades and Attention Problems; grades in mathematics and treatment duration; and age when the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> occurred and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0522174" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Delinquent Behavior</z:e> in the group of treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was positively correlated with the scores in the subscales of Withdrawn and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0522174" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Delinquent Behavior</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of additional extrarolandic focus and spread of focal specific discharges to the centrofrontotemporal and centroparietotemporal areas were related to higher scores in Social Problems, Attention Problems, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0522174" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Delinquent Behavior</z:e> in the group of the treated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, especially those treated and with a longer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> course, were found to be at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lower grades were associated with a longer disease course and medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of extrarolandic discharges was related to higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e> scores in the group of the treated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
