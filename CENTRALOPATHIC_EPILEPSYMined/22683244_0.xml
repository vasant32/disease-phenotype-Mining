<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there is no intellectual deficit, children with RE may have specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to identify changes in executive functions in children with RE and to verify the influence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 25 children with RE and 28 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the RE children had worse performance than the control group in some categories of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the Trail Making Test part B, and the Verbal Fluency Test (FAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> had worse performance when compared with children with later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that children with RE may show a deficit in executive function despite their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The set of tests was more extensive than what was previously used in other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> can interfere with brain development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regarding cognition, the term benign should be used cautiously in RE </plain></SENT>
