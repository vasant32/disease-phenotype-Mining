<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These children constituted 31% of the children with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> EEG activity observed in the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dipolic spikes occurred either as a single focus (78%) or as two independent foci with a greater preponderance to the right (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> before the age of 5 years (Group I) is 53% and between 6 and 10 years (Group II) is 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation showed that 60% of the patients in Group I and 75% in Group II had lateralized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were initially diagnosed as nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic-clonic seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A follow-up study showed 31% complete recovery, 47% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free under medications, 8% occasional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, 8% frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and the rest 6% had a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> without medication </plain></SENT>
