<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes in children with malignant rolandic-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">sylvian epilepsy</z:e> (MRSE), defined as a form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> characterized by sensorimotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, medical refractoriness, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI, frontocentrotemporal EEG spikes, rolandic-sylvian spike sources on magnetoencephalography (MEG), and cognitive problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis of seven patients who had shown these characteristics and undergone extensive diagnostic testing, including MEG and intracranial video-EEG was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interictal scalp EEG spikes were seen over the frontocentrotemporal regions bilaterally (6) and unilaterally (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEG showed spike sources in the perisylvian region in two patients (both bilateral) and in the perirolandic fissure in five (two bilateral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients required bilateral subdural strips to lateralize <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> before electrocorticography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Final electrocorticograms showed an ictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> zone around the rolandic (four cases) and rolandic-sylvian regions (three cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients showed neuropsychological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After cortical excision and multiple subpial transection, three were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free and four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> rarely (30 months' mean follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No child had a permanent deficit in sensorimotor or cognitive functions, although two showed exacerbation of preexisting attentional deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tissue analysis showed definite evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002269'>neuronal migration disorders</z:hpo> (3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MEG was helpful for localizing both malignant rolandic-sylvian neuronal activities and functional cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Successive neuropsychological assessments are necessary to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deterioration</z:e> and indicate remedial programming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If, after careful observation over at least 5 years, surgery is considered to control refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, intracranial video-EEG is needed to localize the epileptogenic zone </plain></SENT>
