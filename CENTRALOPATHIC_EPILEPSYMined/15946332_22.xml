<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (BRE) has an excellent prognosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, but recent research has raised concerns using cognition as an outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methodologic problems related to recruitment bias and assessment processes are evident in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With well-defined criteria for inclusion and comprehensive assessment, the aim of this study was to define the cognitive profile of children with BRE and to assess the effect of interictal EEG activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n=42) were recruited from six EEG laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EEG features analyzed were spike frequency, trains, and laterality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive neuropsychological and language assessments were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group means on cognitive measures were compared with normative means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tests were correlated with EEG features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study demonstrated that children with BRE have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence and language ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a specific pattern of difficulties in memory and phonologic awareness was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a large proportion of children had disproportionate scores in these areas compared with intellectual and language ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EEG features were minimally associated with cognitive difficulties, and no correlation was found with memory indices and tests of phonologic awareness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Some children with BRE have specific difficulties in memory and phonologic processing skills, not explained by interictal activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We recommend that pediatricians ask about academic performance specifically in areas of prereading, reading, spelling, and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If difficulties are suspected, assessment targeting phonologic awareness and memory are recommended, as they may not be reflected in overall intellectual and language ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Difficulties in phonologic awareness affect literacy, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory problems</z:e> affect academic performance </plain></SENT>
