<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such information derived from the routine EEG supports the clinician in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed analytical or computerized studies of spike characteristics have not had a great deal of clinical impact to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This communication presents an argument for characterizing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> focus based on interictal spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some findings from quantitative analysis of spike properties are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By facilitating the creation and refinement of hypotheses relating to the underlying neuronal mechanisms, mathematical source modeling (or dipole modeling) may enhance our understanding of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such an approach is applied to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> as an example, and a model is proposed that is parsimonious with experimental data and clinical observations </plain></SENT>
