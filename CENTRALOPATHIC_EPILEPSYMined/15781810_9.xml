<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 70% are successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors examined how often <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> follows discontinuation of AED treatment in a population-based cohort of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Nova Scotia population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> cohort was used to identify children who discontinued AEDs but subsequently developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients studied (ages 1 month to 16 years) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> between 1977 and 1985, had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsies</z:e> characterized by partial or <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and had at least 5 years of follow-up evaluation (n = 367) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intractability was defined as one or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> every 3 months during the last year of follow-up review or until successful <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> surgery and failure of three or more AEDs at maximum tolerated doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 71% (260/367) of eligible children became free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> for 1 to 4 years and discontinued AED treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of this group, 70% remained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free without AED treatment, but 30% had recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only three children with recurrences later developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two then underwent a temporal lobectomy, one successful and one only partially successful (20-year follow-up periods) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The third patient continued to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> for 7 years after discontinuing AED treatment but eventually entered remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Approximately 1% of children who became free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and discontinued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug treatment had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> that could not be controlled again with medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The authors were unable to predict this outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether a similar outcome would have occurred if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs had not been discontinued </plain></SENT>
