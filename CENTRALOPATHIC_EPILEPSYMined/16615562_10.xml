<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite increasing data on treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, research findings on childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> are more limited and many clinical questions remain unanswered, so that clinicians must often rely on clinical judgment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In such clinical situations, expert opinion can be especially helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A survey on pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (33 questions and 645 treatment options) was sent to 41 U.S. physicians specializing in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, 39 (95%) of whom completed it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some questions, the experts were asked to recommend overall treatment approaches for specific syndromes (the order in which they would use certain strategies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the questions asked the experts to rate options using a modified version of the RAND 9-point scale for medical appropriateness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consensus was defined as a non-random distribution of scores by chi-square test, with ratings used to assign a categorical rank (first line/usually appropriate, second line/equivocal, and third line/usually not appropriate) to each option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Valproate was treatment of choice for symptomatic myoclonic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic-clonic seizures</z:hpo> except in the very young, with lamotrigine and topiramate also first line (usually appropriate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="10127">Zonisamide</z:chebi> was first line only if the child also has myoclonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For initial monotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002384'>complex partial seizures</z:hpo>, oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine were treatments of choice, with lamotrigine and levetiracetam also first line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As initial therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infantile spasms</z:e> caused by tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, viagabatrin was treatment of choice, with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) also first line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As initial therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infantile spasms</z:e> that are symptomatic in etiology, ACTH was treatment of choice, with topiramate also first line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As initial therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lennox-Gastaut syndrome</z:e>, valproate was treatment of choice, with topiramate and lamotrigine also first line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment of a prolonged febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> or cluster of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, rectal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> was treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes</z:e>, oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine were treatments of choice, with gabapentin, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam also first line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For childhood <z:mp ids='MP_0003216'>absence epilepsy</z:mp>, ethosuximide was treatment of choice, with valproate and lamotrigine also first line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For juvenile <z:mp ids='MP_0003216'>absence epilepsy</z:mp>, valproate and lamotrigine were treatments of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270853" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="JME|EJM">juvenile myoclonic epilepsy</z:e> in adolescent males, valproate and lamotrigine were treatments of choice, with topiramate also first line; for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270853" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="JME|EJM">juvenile myoclonic epilepsy</z:e> in adolescent females, lamotrigine was treatment of choice, with topiramate and valproate other first-line options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>As initial therapy for neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo>, intravenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> was treatment of choice, with intravenous lorazepam or fosphenytoin also first line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>As initial therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo>, lorazepam was treatment of choice, with intravenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> also first line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For generalized tonic-clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo>, rectal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> and fosphenytoin were also first line; for complex partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo>, fosphenytoin was also first line; and for absence <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo>, intravenous valproate was also first line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expert panel reached consensus on many treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Within the limits of expert opinion and with the understanding that new research data may take precedence, the experts' recommendations provide helpful guidance in situations where the medical literature is scant or lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The information in this report should be evaluated in conjunction with evidence-based findings </plain></SENT>
