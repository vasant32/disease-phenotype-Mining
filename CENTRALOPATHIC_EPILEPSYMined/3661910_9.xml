<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three groups were considered: Group I, 11 patients (15%) with a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>: Group II, 40 patients (56%) with 2 to 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>; Group III, 21 patients (29%) with over 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant predictors of rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency were: presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> as the sole ictal manifestation, found in 17 patients of Group II and in one patient of Group III (p less than 0.001), and longer average interval between first and second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> in Group II than in Group III (7.8 months versus 3.5 months, p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the average duration of the disease was significantly shorter in Group II than in Group III (1.5 years versus 4.5 years, p less than 0.00001), the duration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> treatment was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 untreated patients, 5 had a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and one had 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> treatment be delayed without risk until the third <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> occurrence and restricted to patients with no predictor of rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
