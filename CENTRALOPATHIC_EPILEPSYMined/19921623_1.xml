<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: To date no controlled, randomised studies with flexible dose regimens have been conducted in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, and therapy is therefore still empirical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of clobazam (CLB) compared with that of carbamazepine (CBZ) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, open, controlled and randomised study was carried out to compare CBZ and CLB in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> with a follow-up over a two-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A random sample of 45 patients was taken and 38 of them finished the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A flexible dose regimen was indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, academic performance, behaviour, adherence to treatment, parents' degree of satisfaction and side effect profiles were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both drugs were equally effective at controlling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (94.1% of patients with CLB and 100% of those with CBZ were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> on ending the study; p = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CLB controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> earlier (33.3 +/- 45 days versus 48.2 +/- 72.3; p &lt; 0.05) and had fewer side effects than CBZ (side effects appeared in three patients with CLB and in eight of those on CBZ; p = 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two of the patients taking CBZ, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> got worse and a series of cognitive-behavioural complications also appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CBZ is an effective drug in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, but it may be associated with exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> as well as with cognitive-behavioural impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CLB in monotherapy seems to be an effective and better tolerated drug in this kind of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
