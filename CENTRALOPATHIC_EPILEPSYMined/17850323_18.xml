<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Associations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (RE) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>reading disability</z:hpo> (RD) and speech sound disorder (SSD) have not been tested in a controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a case-control study to determine whether (1) RD and SSD odds are higher in RE probands than controls and (2) an RE proband predicts a family member with RD or SSD, hence suggesting a shared genetic etiology for RE, RD, and SSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Unmatched case-control study with 55 stringently defined RE cases, 150 controls in the same age range lacking a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disorder</z:e> diagnosis, and their siblings and parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by multiple logistic regression, adjusted for sex and age, and for relatives, also adjusted for comorbidity of RD and SSD in the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RD was strongly associated with RE after adjustment for sex and age: OR 5.78 (95% CI: 2.86-11.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An RE proband predicts RD in family members: OR 2.84 (95% CI: 1.38-5.84), but not independently of the RE proband's RD status: OR 1.30 (95% CI: 0.55-12.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SSD was also comorbid with RE: adjusted OR 2.47 (95%CI: 1.22-4.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An RE proband predicts SSD in relatives, even after controlling for sex, age and proband SSD comorbidity: OR 4.44 (95% CI: 1.93-10.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RE is strongly comorbid with RD and SSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both RD and SSD are likely to be genetically influenced and may contribute to the complex genetic etiology of the RE syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Siblings of RE patients are at high risk of RD and SSD and both RE patients and their younger siblings should be screened early </plain></SENT>
