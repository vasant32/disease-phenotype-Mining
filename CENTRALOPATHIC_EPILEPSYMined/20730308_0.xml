<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, electroencephalogram (EEG), WISC-III and School Performance Test were compared at the start and end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine (28.1%) children continued having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epileptiform activity (EA) on the EEG reduced in number and was no longer recorded in 6 (18.7%) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant improvement in the performance and perceptual organization IQ values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The improvement in reading performance failed to reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The performance in arithmetic worsened in 43.7% of the children, and this was associated with the persistence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between changes in cognitive aspects and characteristics of EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is a need to continue this study, and also search for other factors influencing the evolution of cognitive abilities in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
