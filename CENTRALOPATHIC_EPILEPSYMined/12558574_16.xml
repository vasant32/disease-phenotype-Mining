<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to demonstrate the cerebral origin of her interictal spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EEG was recorded within the 3 Tesla MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole brain fMRI images were acquired, beginning 2-3 seconds after spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline fMRI images were acquired when there were no spikes for 20 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Image sets were compared with the Student's t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten spike and 20 baseline brain volumes were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Focal activiation was seen in the inferior left sensorimotor cortex near the face area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The anterior cingulate was more active during baseline than spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Left sided epileptiform activity in this patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> is associated with fMRI activation in the left face region of the somatosensory cortex, which would be consistent with the facial sensorimotor involvement in BECT <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of BOLD signal change in other regions raises the possibility that the scalp recorded field of this patient with BECTs may reflect electrical change in more than one brain region </plain></SENT>
