<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six patients with classic benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> of childhood with centrotemporal spikes, treated with carbamazepine (four patients) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9925">sodium valproate</z:chebi> (two patients) evolved atypically because the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic disorder</z:e>, diffusion of the electroencephalographic (EEG) discharges during wakefulness, and continuous spike-and-wave during slow sleep associated with severe neuropsychologic abnormalities worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These features appeared after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free interval varying for 2 weeks to 1 year 6 months after initiating therapy and remitted when the previous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> drug was discontinued and either substituted with another drug or the patient was left without any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Once the initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug was discontinued and after a period roughly proportional to the duration of the clinical-EEG complication, the evolution of the patients' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was not unusual for this type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, with patients eventually becoming free of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and medication and reaching <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> school achievement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical complications cannot be attributed solely to the drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It must also be related to the underlying substract (i.e., the specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> syndrome involved) that in some patients becomes susceptible to atypical evolution when either product is administered </plain></SENT>
