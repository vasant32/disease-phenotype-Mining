<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a population-based case ascertainment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the possible sources of medical care in seven counties of Estonia from January 1995 to December 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only cases of patients from 1 month to 19 years of age with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (i.e., at least one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> during the last 5 years, regardless of treatment) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined by a pediatric neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five hundred sixty cases met the study criteria on the prevalence day, December 31, 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total PR was 3.6 per 1,000 population (boy/girl ratio, 1.2:1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PR was the highest-4.3 per 1,000-in the 5-to-9-year-old age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence declined markedly in children age 14 years and on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation between age and PR was negative (-0.542, p &lt; 0.0001) by regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types in the total group were primarily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo>-PR 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>1/1,000 [rate ratio (RR) 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.6] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The predominance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> was significant in those younger than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 14.8% of cases, there was a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> among first- and second-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e>-PR 0.2/1,000-was the most frequent among idiopathic syndromes, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lennox-Gastaut syndrome</z:e>-PR 0.08/1,000-was the most frequent among cryptogenic ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Perinatal factors-PR 0.8/1,000 were the most frequently found cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In 304 cases (54.2%), additional medical problems existed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was comparable with that found in developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>Generalized seizures</z:hpo> predominated, and the main cause was perinatal factors </plain></SENT>
