<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A spontaneous and complete recovery of benign childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centrotemporal or rolandic spikes (BECT) is taken for granted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some authors have reported the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic-clonic seizures</z:hpo> in a few adult patients and in some children who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> after a long period without problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were (a) to search for early predictors of outcome and (b) to ascertain the long-term prognosis of BECT in a large group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An attempt to relocate 268 patients born between 1941 and 1967 and consecutively seen as outpatients was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome after age 20 is known for only 168 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Being adults and cured, the others are no longer in touch with their clinics or have moved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one indicator of short-term prognosis was found: The earlier the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BECT, the longer the period with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 168 patients, 165 are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free with follow-up ranging from 7 to 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic-clonic seizures</z:hpo> at age 18, 22-24, and 35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two apparently had an isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of such <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> after recovery from BECT is a rare event (approximately 2% of cases) and a relapse with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>partial seizures</z:hpo> is quite uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These patients do not differ from patients remaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free </plain></SENT>
