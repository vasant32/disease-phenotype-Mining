<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report on sibling cases with benign familial neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> (BFNC) followed by benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centrotemporal spikes (BECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case histories and EEGs were obtained for the two siblings with neonatal and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in one pedigree with BFNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The family included six affected cases of BFNC in two generations: the proband, the proband's mother and two sisters, and the proband's maternal uncle and his daughter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proband developed a generalized tonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036572,C0009951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">convulsion</z:e> 2 days after birth with no apparent cause and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002372'>normal interictal EEG</z:hpo>, and experienced a total of 18 episodes of tonic or clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or both by age 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up course, an EEG recording showed rolandic discharges at 2 years, and a sylvian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> occurred at 4 years during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On carbamazepine therapy, the last <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> was recorded at 9 years after a total of 11 episodes of sylvian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EEGs after 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proband's sister experienced nine episodes of brief tonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> between 7 and 9 days after birth, and also developed eight episodes of sylvian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> from 4 to 7 years, with rolandic discharges on EEG until age 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the family members had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> psychomotor development, with no neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This report of BFNC followed by BECT in sibling cases is significant in view of the genetic analysis and the classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsies</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> syndromes </plain></SENT>
