<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In children affected by specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo> (SLI), many authors have investigated a link between language and epileptiform discharges during sleep resembling the focal sharp waves typical of benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centro-temporal spikes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>), the so-called rolandic spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the same electroencephalographic trait occurs in more than 50% of children affected by learning or behavioural disabilities without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, supporting the hypothesis of a common genetic disposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The biological background of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011757" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Developmental Coordination Disorder</z:e> (DCD) is currently unknown, but a genetic liability may be assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of our study were first to estimate the prevalence of sleep-related epileptiform discharges in children affected by DCD and second to investigate the occurrence of DCD in a population of children affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected a group of eight children with severe DCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this group, the presence of epileptiform activity was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also searched for DCD among a group of 13 children affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found rolandic spikes in more than 70% of the children with severe DCD and severe DCD in more than 30% of the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In children with severe DCD other disabilities are frequently associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In these children, epileptiform activity during sleep is very frequently found and in our opinion, this represents a hallmark of 'Hereditary Impairment of Brain Maturation', a term only partially resembling 'Atypical Brain Development' </plain></SENT>
