<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We reviewed studies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsies</z:e> (ER) and analyzed them according to definite criteria to establish the typical clinical and electroencephalographic phenotypes and therapeutic strategy to be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DEVELOPMENT: The criteria for definition leave gaps which permit inclusion, as typical forms of ER, variant forms or syndromes related to ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical phenotypes: 1) Classical phenotypes with senso motor, phonatory or autonomic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>; 2) Benign partial state which is rarely seen; 3) ER with cognitive involvement usually of attention, reading, auditory verbal learning, semantic fluency and visuomotor coordination; 4) Idiopathic ER with interictal facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo>; and 5) Other phenotypes include ER coinciding with a pre existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234387" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral disorder</z:e> and transient EPOCS of iatrogenic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EEG phenotypes: 1) Classical EEG with unilateral or bilateral, synchronous or asynchronous Rolandic paroxysms; 2) Phenotypes with generalized PO; 3) Phenotype with centroparietal slow waves, rare and usually transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The various authors do not agree as to whether treatment should be recommended although in the studies we consulted there was a high proportion of ER and it was recognized that the risk of inducing EPOCS on treatment was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the literature of typical forms of ER shows that apart from the classical form there is a continuous range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> dysfunction, both clinical and of EEG, which includes the related variant forms and syndromes, although the long term prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> is good, some with and some without treatment </plain></SENT>
