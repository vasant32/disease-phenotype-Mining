<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical, neurophysiologic characteristics and therapeutic considerations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> (ENM) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atypical benign partial epilepsy</z:e> of childhood (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Video-EEG monitoring with outstretched arm tests were carried out in 17 patients, and 9 of them were examined with simultaneous electromyography (EMG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ENM manifestations, electrophysiologic features and responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs (AED) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients were diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BECT) during the early course of the disease and were treated with AED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the course of the disease, hand <z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>trembling</z:mp>, objects dropping, <z:mp ids='MP_0001410'>head nodding</z:mp> and instability during standing might be clues for ENM occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ENM had been confirmed in our patients by outstretched arm tests during video-EEG recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ictal EEG showed that high-amplitude spikes followed by a slow wave over the contralateral motor areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was further confirmed by time-locked silent EMG in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During ENM occurrence or recurrence, the habitual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and interictal discharges were exaggerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0007270'>Atypical absence seizures</z:hpo> also occurred in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The alteration of therapeutic options of AED relating to ENM appearance in some patients included the add-on therapy with carbamazepine (CBZ), oxcarbazepine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi>, or withdrawal of valproate (VPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ENM was controlled in most cases by using VPA, clonazepam (CZP) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> with different combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ENM could occur during the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Outstretching arm tests during video-EEG monitoring in combination with EMG was essential to confirm ENM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The ENM occurrence was always associated with the frequency increasing of habitual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and the aggravation of interictal discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Some AED such as CBZ might induce ENM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>VPA, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> with different combination were relatively effective in treatment of ENM </plain></SENT>
