<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A computerized neuropsychological battery was used for cognitive evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Affective and cognitive social cognition were evaluated using two computerized Theory of Mind tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive abilities and social behavior of 15 children, diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, ages 7 to 13 years were assessed and compared with 15 age- and education-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> patients had lower scores on verbal and visual learning rate parameters and on verbal processing and were significantly impaired on "affective Theory of Mind" tasks but not on "cognitive Theory of Mind" conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings raise the possibility that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> may affect neural networks affecting cognition and mediating social cognition essential for social behavior, thus challenging the benign nature of the condition </plain></SENT>
