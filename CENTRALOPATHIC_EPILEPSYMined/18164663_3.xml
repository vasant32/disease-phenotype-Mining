<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a combined neuroelectric and neuromagnetic study in 24 consecutive patients with BREC using a 143-channel whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) system simultaneously with electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from 40 closely spaced scalp-EEG electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isopotential and isofield maps were calculated over the time window from 250ms before to 250ms after the maximum of the negative peak of the spike </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then performed principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and spatio-temporal dipole modeling in order to estimate the number, location and temporal activity of sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EEG and MEG spikes were characterized by a stereotypical appearance both within and across patients showing a stable dipolar field distribution over the entire time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spikes were generated by a single tangential dipolar source located in the precentral gyrus with the positive pole directed frontally and the negative pole directed centro-temporally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One source located in the precentral gyrus can adequately explain the spike complex in BREC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Simultaneous EEG and MEG provide comprehensive information on functional organization of spikes in BREC </plain></SENT>
