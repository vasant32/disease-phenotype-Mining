<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LEV was administered as a first drug (number of patients=9) or converted after previous treatment with other AEDs (number of patients=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were subdivided into two groups: "newly diagnosed" patients and "converted" patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up for 12 months and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were able to continue on LEV treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up (12 months), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free or showed a reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> &gt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LEV dosage ranged from 1000 to 2500mg/daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 100% of patients completed the 12 months study, without any important side effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>Somnolence</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> occurred in two (9.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results support findings that LEV monotherapy is effective and well tolerated in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective, large, long-term double-blind studies are needed to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
