<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further insight into the nature of these relationships can be expected only from NS patients with long-term follow-up, which includes the age range of maximum manifestation of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsies</z:e> (SSE), and age-dependent genetic EEG traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A sample of such cases will necessarily be selected and thus prohibit any quantitative inferences regarding the incidence of SSE and special EEG characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the data provide new aspects with regard to a possibly multifactorial pathogenesis of NS and SSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children in the present study were selected applying the following inclusion criteria: cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> during the first 14 days of life; follow up of more than two years with at least two EEG recordings beyond the age of two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children with metabolic NS or subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">West syndrome</z:e> were not included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six cases were confirmed, 42 with SSE, 34 without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of EEG symptoms of a generalized genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> liability (theta rhythms, generalized spikes and waves, photoparoxysmal response) was significantly elevated, equally in children with and without SSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Beyond the age of two years, 50% of the probands had focal sharp waves foci characteristic of idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e> (e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among SSE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002373'>febrile convulsions</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsies</z:e> with benign course dominated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that in a certain proportion of cases, NS have genetic factors in common with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Quantitative representative data cannot be obtained to determine the incidence of such pathogenetic mechanisms in NS and SSE </plain></SENT>
