<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records obtained in 22 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> arising from the rolandic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent preoperative electroencephalography (EEG), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, prolonged video-EEG recordings, functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, magnetoencephalography, and in some instances PET/SPECT studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 21 patients invasive subdural grid and depth electrode monitoring was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resection of the epileptogenic zones in the rolandic region was undertaken in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> outcome was graded according to the Engel classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was determined using validated outcome scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 10 girls and 12 boys, whose mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 3.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age at surgery was 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> duration prior to surgery was a mean of 7.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological testing revealed impairment in some domains in 19 patients in whom evaluation was possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities were identified in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Magnetoencephalography was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and showed perirolandic spike clusters on the affected side in 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of invasive monitoring was 4.2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mean number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> during the period of invasive monitoring was 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent resection that involved primary motor and/or sensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The most common pathological entity encountered was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo>, in 13 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Immediately postoperatively, 20 patients had differing degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, from mild to severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected patients by 3-6 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>With a mean follow-up of 4.1 years (minimum 2 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome in 14 children (64%) was Engel Class I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome in 4 (18%) was Engel Class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In this series, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome following perirolandic resection was intimately related to the child's age at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>By univariate logistic regression analysis, age at surgery was a statistically significant factor predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome (p &lt; 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Resection of rolandic cortex for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> is possible with expected morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Accurate mapping of regions of functional cortex and epileptogenic zones may lead to improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome in children with intractable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It is important to counsel patients and families preoperatively to prepare them for possible worsened functional outcome involving motor, sensory and/or language pathways </plain></SENT>
