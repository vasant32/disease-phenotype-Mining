<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In four cases of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> (RS) (age 3 1/2, 6, 11 and 12 years), paroxysmal activity and especially spike discharges over the central region could be blocked or attenuated by passive finger movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This response, however, is not demonstrable in the majority of children with RS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blocking or attenuating effect of passive movements is compared with earlier observations of central spike discharges occurring in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some of these children, central spikes could be blocked by active hand movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was assumed that such a positive blocking response underscores the "functional" ("dysfunctional") character of the Rolandic spikes and the lack of local structural damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and central spike (and evidence of structural brain damage), such a blocking response was not obtainable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taking into consideration these earlier observations, there is reason to presume that the central spike activity found in RS is based on dysfunction rather than on structural impairment </plain></SENT>
