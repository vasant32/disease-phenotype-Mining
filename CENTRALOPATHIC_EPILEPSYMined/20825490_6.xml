<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently showed genomewide linkage of centrotemporal sharp waves (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e>) in classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (RE) families to chromosome 11p13, and fine-mapped this locus to variants in the ELP4 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Speech sound disorder (SSD) is a common comorbidity in RE subjects, of unknown etiology, which co-aggregates in family members in a manner that could hypothetically be explained by shared underlying genetic risk with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the neural mechanism of SSD is unknown, although individuals with rare, Mendelian forms of RE are described with severe verbal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007301'>oromotor apraxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore first performed genomewide linkage analysis for SSD, operationally defined as clinical history consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10 speech <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003910" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">articulation disorder</z:e>, in 38 families singly ascertained through a proband with RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis of shared genetic risk with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e> at the 11p13 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second part of the study we used computerized acoustic analysis of recorded speech to test the hypothesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003635" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">dyspraxia</z:e> as a mechanism for SSD in a smaller subset of RE probands and relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two-point and multipoint LOD score analysis, we found that evidence for linkage to the 11p13 locus increased substantially when the phenotype was broadened from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e>/SSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multipoint analysis, the LOD score rose by 3.2 to HLOD 7.54 at D11S914 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e>/SSD, the same marker at which multipoint linkage maximized for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Non-parametric, affected-only methods in a sub-set of the data provide further confirmatory evidence for pleiotropy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In acoustic analysis there were voice-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> time abnormalities in 10/18 RE probands, 8/16 siblings and 5/15 parents, providing evidence of breakdown in the spatial/temporal properties of speech articulation consistent with a dyspraxic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results from genetic and physiological studies suggest a pleiotropic role for the 11p13 locus in the development of both SSD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e>, and also indicate a dyspraxic mechanism for the SSD linked to 11p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data strongly support a neurodevelopmental origin for classic RE </plain></SENT>
