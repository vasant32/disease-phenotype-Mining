<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> is in many cases associated with developmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, from the literature it is unclear exactly which domains are affected; A wide variety of investigations are reported that each provide a different representation of language performance in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this study is to compare performance on the language domains between children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective study of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>25 children (mean age 136.6 months, SD 23.0) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> and 25 age-matched healthy controls were tested on their language function using the CELF-4 (Clinical evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Dutch edition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The healthy control were not matched regard to other important factors, particularly educational attainment and co-morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expressive language, receptive language, language content, language structure and language working memory were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, the core language score was significant lower compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They scored specifically lower on the receptive language index and language content index (both p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A trend towards decreased expressive language index was observed (p = 0.054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Language structure and language working memory were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Language was found to be impaired in children with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Especially semantic language processing including receptive language and language content was significantly impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The common denominator of these functions is semantic language processing </plain></SENT>
