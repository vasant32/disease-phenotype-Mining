<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of sulthiame (Ospolot; STM) monotherapy compared with placebo on the EEG in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-six patients (aged 3-11 years) entered a 6-month double-blind trial and were randomized to either STM (n = 31) or placebo (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data and general results have been reported elsewhere (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One-hundred seventy-nine sleep EEGs were recorded at screening and after 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EEGs were analyzed by a blind reviewer using a standard protocol for each EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This standard protocol collected data on general changes, specific epileptiform, and nonspecific focal and generalized changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A classification system was defined depending on rating of pathologic EEG changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the higher number of treatment-failure events (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>) in the placebo group, there was an increasing imbalance between the two groups regarding the number of recorded sleep EEGs over time (STM, 104; placebo, 74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test was used to describe differences in the grade of pathology during individual follow-up between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sleep-EEG was found to be normalized in 21 patients treated with STM (12/21 transient) and in five patients treated with placebo (4/5 transient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the STM group, the EEG showed a marked improvement during intraindividual course when comparing the classification of follow-up EEGs at each time point with the screening EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparable improvements were not observed in the placebo group (exact two-tailed p value at 4 weeks, p &lt; 0.0001; at 3 months, p = 0.0010; and at 6 months, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: STM had marked effects on the EEG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, which led to normalization in the majority of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most of those whose EEGs were not normalized showed improvement in the grade of EEG pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Normalization persisted in &gt;50% of patients during the investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous normalization in the placebo group reflects the wide spectrum of individual courses, which must be considered when analyzing drug effects on EEG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
