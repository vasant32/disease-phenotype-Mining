<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 969 encephalograms from 463 epileptic children to determine outcome differences between those with fixed foci (FF) and those with migrated foci (MF) on at least three encephalograms over 3years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> spike foci were classified as frontal, temporal, central, parietal, or occipital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Migration directions were divided into anterior, posterior, lateral, and unclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine cases met the inclusion criteria: 24 (30%) FF and 55 (70%) MF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More patients in the FF than in the MF group required multiple <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs (P=0.004), and had abnormal image findings (P=0.014), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> (P=0.035), and worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control (P=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> frequency (P=0.007; correlation coefficient=0.56) and the number of prescribed drugs (P=0.047; correlation coefficient=0.372) were more significant in the FF group than in the MF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When we compared only whether the cases were symptomatic or cryptogenic, we found the same outcome trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparisons of only idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> patients, the FF group had non-significantly different outcomes compared with those in the MF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When we compared 16 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BECTs) and 8 Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS), the cases with BECTs had more FF (38% vs. 0%, P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that outcomes may not correlate as well in FF cases as they do in MF cases </plain></SENT>
