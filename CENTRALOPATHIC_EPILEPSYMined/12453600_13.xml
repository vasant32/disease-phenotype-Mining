<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the 30 patients, six had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> that was particularly severe and two also showed atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>facial dysmorphism</z:hpo> that was different from that seen in classical Fra-X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the study performed in this series of Fra-X patients the authors arrived at the following conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(1) The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in Fra-X population is around 20%, as reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) The EEG pattern of benign childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with central-temporal spikes (BCECTS) was found in only three patients (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) According to the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and EEGs, four groups may be recognizable, the less frequent being the uncommon group characterized by severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> unresponsive to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(4) In this group atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>facial dysmorphism</z:hpo> (although not similar in the two patients and different from the classical facial pattern of Fra-X) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors maintain that additional genetic factors might influence the clinical course and neurological aspects of Fra-X syndrome </plain></SENT>
