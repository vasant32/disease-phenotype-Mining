<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six patients (4 boys and 2 girls, age range: 4-8 years, 3 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282512" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="LKS">Landau-Kleffner syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e>), 3 patients with atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (ARE)) were investigated by FDG-PET and MSI at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of CSWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>(s) of spike-waves discharges were associated with significant focal hypermetabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The propagation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> discharges to other brain areas was associated with focal hypermetabolism (five patients), hypometabolism (one patient) or the absence of any significant metabolic change (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, most of the hypometabolic areas were not involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> network per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study shows that focal hypermetabolism observed at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of CSWS are related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or propagation sites of spike-wave discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spike-wave discharges propagation can be associated to other types of metabolic changes, suggesting the occurrence of various neurophysiological mechanisms at the cellular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the hypometabolic areas are not involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> network as such and are probably related to a mechanism of remote inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the critical value of combining FDG-PET with time-sensitive functional neuroimaging approaches such as MSI to assess CSWS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> network when surgery is considered as a therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
