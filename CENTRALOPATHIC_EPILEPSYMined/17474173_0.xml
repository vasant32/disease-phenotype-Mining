<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Up till now there have been many discussions in the epileptological literature concerning the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (RE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of study: The aim of this study is to establish whether there exist any differences in general intelligence quotient or in particular cognitive functions in children with RE as compared to healthy children in the same age and if a correlation can be found between EEG and cognitive function in RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The material comprised two groups: 38 children with RE (1-2 years after diagnosis establishing) and 15 children of the same age and sex - the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study group was then subdivided into: 26 children with typical EEG patterns and 12 with atypical EEG acc. to Dalla Bernardina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of WICS, Benton, Raven's test, Bender-Koppitz and Bender-Gestalt test and 16-canal standard wake and sleep EEG were taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis included: Student-test and Fisher exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IQ of children with RE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of scores (full, verbal or non-verbal) did not differ from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some differences in particular cognitive functions were found: auditory memory (p&lt;0.01), logical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the group of children with RE and atypical EEG pattern the full and non-verbal score was lower (p&lt; 0.05) and we found in these children statistically significant deficit in analytic-synthetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e> based on concrete material and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> (p&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In spite of no difference in general IQ among children with RE and the control group, there are some <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> particularly concerning auditory memory and logical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The children with atypical changes in EEG are the risk group of lower full and nonverbal score analytic-synthetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e> based on concrete material and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
