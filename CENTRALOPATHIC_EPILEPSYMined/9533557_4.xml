<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the topographic mapping of the electroencephalography (EEG) of 47 children whose clinical history and course were compatible with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BCECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine (62%) patients showed typical dipole fields, with a negative potential field in the centrotemporal region and a positive field in the frontal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen children did not demonstrate the typical dipole field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their non-dipole rolandic discharges were localized in small fields of centrotemporal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with dipole fields in BCECT had significantly less frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> than patients without dipole fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 47 patients with BCECT (26%) had more than one EEG focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical courses of patients with multiple foci were not worse than those of patients with a single focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that EEG topographic mapping is helpful in identifying typical or atypical EEG topographic patterns in patients with clinically diagnosed BCECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also conclude that the presence of dipole field usually indicates a better clinical course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and multiple foci do not mean a poor clinical course </plain></SENT>
