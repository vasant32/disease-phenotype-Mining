<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results could be summarized as follows: the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> is relatively frequent entity (13.4% of the total number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age span was from 3--13 years, with a peak of age incidence between the 7th and 8th year of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More than half of children had nocturnal fits only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the clinical point of view 60% of children had generalized crises, and the remaining 40% had partial attacks corresponding to the functional organization of the Rolandic cortical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evolution of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> in childhood is favourable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 50% didn't have more attacks after the introduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> therapy, and 3/4 of them could be classified as practically cured after an long-term follow-up (criterion: an attack-free period of at least 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, in more than 80% of cases after three years of follow-up the spikes have disappeared from the EEG tracings which were completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
