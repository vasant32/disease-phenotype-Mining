<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the reported benign evolution of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndrome, neuropsychological assessment has been considered unnecessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the benign nature of BCECTS has recently been challenged: verbal dysfunction as well as impaired visuomotor coordination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001328'>specific learning disabilities</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit</z:hpo> have been noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings prompted this research study in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with BCECTS attending our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> clinic underwent neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen children (10 boys and seven girls) aged 7 to 14 years were investigated with a neuropsychological test battery focusing on immediate and delayed recall of auditory-verbal and visual material, verbal fluency, problem-solving ability, and visuospatial constructional ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Raven's coloured matrices and questionnaires regarding school functioning and behaviour were also administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The children were matched with control subjects for age, sex, and school </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Children with BCECTS had significantly lower scores than their control subject partners on the neuropsychological items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intellectual abilities did not differ and neither did school functioning or behaviour according to teachers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Parents, however, recognized greater difficulties with concentration, temperament, and impulsiveness in children with BCECTS </plain></SENT>
