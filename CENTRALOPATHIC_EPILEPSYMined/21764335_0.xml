<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 198 patients with BIS (78 of whom were familial cases), we evaluated 12 unrelated patients with BIS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> seen at two pediatric neurology departments from January 1990 to February 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were eight boys and four girls, one of whom was not a familial case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time of follow-up was between 6 and 19 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were brief, focal, with or without secondary generalization, and occurred in clusters in 58% of the cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> was kinesigenic in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As to family history, BIS was found in mothers in two patients, in fathers in five, in a grandfather in one, in grand-uncle in one, in uncles in four, in brothers in three, and in sisters in three other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> was found in fathers in four patients, in the mother in one, in a brother in one, in a cousin in three, in an uncle in one, in an aunt in one, and in grandfathers in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, one patient and a relative with BIS from two different families presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The father of the case with BIS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> also had BIS and benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>focal seizures</z:hpo> of adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BIS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> syndrome is a well-defined familial syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>BIS had the similar features described in patients with familial and non-familial BIS </plain></SENT>
