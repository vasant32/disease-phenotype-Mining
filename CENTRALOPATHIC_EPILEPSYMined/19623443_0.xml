<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study lexical decision in children with BCECTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 42 children with BCECTS were compared with a control group with respect to their hits and response time in a visual discrimination of words and pseudowords task (DWPT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The children with BCECTS had a lower percentage of hits for words and pseudowords and showed longer response times for pseudowords </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also frequently showed inferior reading and writing performance in the school performance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of hits for pseudowords was lower when there was bilateral, asynchronous epileptiform activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DWPT provided contributions for reading assessments in children with BCECTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated the need for attention in detecting reading difficulties in children with BCECTS </plain></SENT>
