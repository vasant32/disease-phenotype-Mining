<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> treatment, most of patients had transitory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disturbances</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were the impairment of verbal functions, especially verbal intellect, while non-verbal intellect remained intact; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003635" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">dyspraxia</z:e>, impairment of auditory-speech memory, disturbances of arbitrary regulation and optical-motor coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was not severe and did not impact on learning of school program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations were found between the lateralization of regional EEG changes and the character of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> though the age-related lateralization of the focal epileptiform activity was shown: the right-side localization of central-temporal EEG spikes predominated in children at the age of 6.29 +/- 0.9 years, the left-side localization - in children at the age of 8.4 +/- 1.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical remission was achieved 4-5 years earlier than the recovery of cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
