<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A girl was placed on continuous EEG recording from her 2d day of life because of her family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> occurred on the 4th day; they appeared again on the 6th day and became prolonged with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were well controlled with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi>, that was gradually discontinued when the child was 3 months old </plain></SENT>
