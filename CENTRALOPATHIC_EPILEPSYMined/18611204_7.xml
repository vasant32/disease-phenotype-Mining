<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In those that did not, mild cognitive problems (26% vs 11%, p=0.005), EF problems (31% vs 11%, p&lt;0.001), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740697" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychosocial problems</z:e> (45% vs 10%, p&lt;0.001) were each much more common than among controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Having problems in two or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of these areas simultaneously was more frequent among the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (14% vs. 3%, p&lt;0.001 and 4% vs 0%, p&lt;0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
