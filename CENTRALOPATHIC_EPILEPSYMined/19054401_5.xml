<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 24 children and adolescents who underwent surgical management of refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient age at the time of surgery ranged between 1.9 and 19.2 years, and median postoperative follow-up was 2.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had clear lesions on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that correlated with noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) and underwent single-stage lesionectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 21 patients who underwent invasive monitoring, 19 underwent therapeutic procedures, including lesionectomy, topectomy, and multiple subpial transections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Engel class I and II outcomes were seen in five of six patients (84.0%) after lesionectomy and in seven of nine patients (77.0%) and four of six patients (66.7%) after sensorimotor corticectomy or multiple subpial transections (MSTs), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, neurologic deficits were observed following 50.0% (n = 3 of 6) of lesionectomies and 67.0% (n = 7 of 9) of topectomies; no neurologic deficits were seen in patients undergoing motor cortex MSTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation existed between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome and duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, age at diagnosis, age at surgery, histopathology, or the presence or absence of a discrete lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Surgery for appropriately selected children with intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> arising from rolandic cortex was effective and associated with minimal neurologic morbidity in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Engel I-II outcome was achieved in 77% of patients overall, and neurologic deficits were often mild and improved over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lesionectomy resulted in the best <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control, followed by topectomy, and then MSTs </plain></SENT>
