<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study this apparent disparity, we evaluated the field distribution of interictal spikes in 33 BRE patients using closely spaced electrodes (AEEGS 1990) arranged over perisylvian cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the 33 patients showed maximum negativity in the midtemporal regions (T3/T4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instead, maximum negativity was evident in the high central region (C3/C4) in 10 children (30.3%) and in the low central region (C5/C6) in 23 (69.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hand involvement was significantly frequent (50%) in the high central group, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002307'>drooling</z:hpo> with oromotor involvement was a distinctive symptom (65.2%) in the low central group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that the spikes in patients with BRE are exclusively suprasylvian in origin and correlate with two electroclinical subgroups </plain></SENT>
