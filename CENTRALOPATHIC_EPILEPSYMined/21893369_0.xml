<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is an age-dependent, genetically determined and benign condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to describe the clinical course and prognosis in 60 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> diagnosed in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We made a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> in a University Hospital (1995-2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were divided into 2 groups: 1) Patients who met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> classical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2) Patients who met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the criteria but one (less than 4 years; diurnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>; atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 60 patients, 34 males and 26 females were included, with 31 patients in group 1 and 29 in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in group 1: 7.45 years, group 2: 6.55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment was indicated in 32.2% of patients in group 1 and 41.3% in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The outcome was favourable in the majority: 58% in group 1 and 62.1% in group 2 were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Average age in which it disappeared: 8.54 years in group 1 and 7.84 years in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in any of these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unlike that published by some authors, we have not identified any poor outcome factors in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> in this study, meaning that an accurate diagnosis correlates with a good prognosis and excellent neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
