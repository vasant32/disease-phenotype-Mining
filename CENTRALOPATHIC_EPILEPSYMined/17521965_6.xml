<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The children were assessed simultaneously with EEG and computerized neuropsychological testing in a visual discrimination between words and pseudowords task (DWPT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 20 (60.6%) children, there were insufficient RS to assess the occurrence of TCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 13 children with RS between stimulus presentation and response, only 2 (15.4%) made a significantly greater proportion of errors during RS than during RS-free periods, characterizing the occurrence of TCI </plain></SENT>
