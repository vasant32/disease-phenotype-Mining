<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic Epilepsy</z:e> is the most common form of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is classified as idiopathic, age-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> syndrome with benign evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The absence of neuropsychological impairment is part of the criteria of benignity of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, however, several deficits related to attention and language have been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: to assess school performance and to investigate praxis problems in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> in comparison to a control group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children, paired by age, gender and educational level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: nineteen patients aged between 7 and 12 years underwent clinical neurological evaluation, psychological assessment, through the Weschsler Scales of Intelligence, and language evaluation, to assess the academic performance and to investigate the presence or absence of praxis difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: the obtained data indicate that although intellectual efficiency (measured through the Intelligence Quatient - IQ) was within average, children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> presented a significantly poorer performance when compared to the control group in tests involving writing, arithmetic and reading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another important aspect was the absence of orofacial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: the results of the study suggest that the assessment of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> is necessary to investigate specific deficits that require appropriate professional assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regarding the presence of oral language and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679448" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">writing disorders</z:e> in these children, academic, social and emotional deficits can be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> syndrome does not exclusively depend on the control of the crises, since social or cultural problems can interfere in life quality as much as the crisis </plain></SENT>
