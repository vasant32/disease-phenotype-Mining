<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five children (50 male and 35 female) attending the Department of Pediatrics of the University of Chieti, the Department of Pediatrics of Brindisi Hospital, and the Department of Neurology of San Valentino Hospital were selected for the study; these patients were subdivided into two groups according to their clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A consisted of children who suffered from typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> and Group B consisted of children with atypical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients of both groups were re-evaluated after at least 8 years from the first evaluation, and the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and the response to treatment were similar in the two groups of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In spite of this fact, in patients who suffered from atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, we found a significantly higher percentage of learning and behavioral disabilities than in children affected by the classical form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (45.5% vs 7.8%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> seems to be associated with a high percentage of learning and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
