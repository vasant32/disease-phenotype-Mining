<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the cognitive and behavioral effects of carbamazepine in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> were evaluated with and without carbamazepine treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen unmedicated subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine headache</z:hpo> evaluated twice served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 6 to 12 years of age, fluent in English, and not mentally retarded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> were quicker on a visual-search task and recalled stories better when not treated than when treated with carbamazepine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After correction for multiple comparisons only the memory finding remained significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher carbamazepine serum level was associated with slower performance on the same visual-search task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This latter finding did not meet multiple comparison criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Numerous significant practice effects were found within the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparisons with reliable change indices identified two subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> with particularly poor scores while receiving carbamazepine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest some effects on memory from carbamazepine; however, they do not support meaningful dosage-related effects, within the recommended range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant practice effects confirmed the need to control for such effects when evaluating treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, identification of two subjects who performed more poorly while on carbamazepine suggests that some children might experience particular difficulties while receiving this medication and highlights the need to investigate individual subject responses to treatment </plain></SENT>
