<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports suggest that MRI abnormalities are not only common, but may be specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tle">temporal lobe epilepsy</z:e>, and lateralized to the side of EEG discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no controlled study has been performed to test the hypothesis of association between MRI abnormalities and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed an unmatched case-control study to test the hypothesis of association between MRI abnormalities and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, using 25 typical RE cases and 25 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two independent examiners rated the MRIs for abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examiners were blinded to the study hypothesis and identity of case and control exams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two percent of RE exams contained at least one abnormality: peri/hippocampal abnormality (one case), non-localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation</z:e> (seven cases), subcortical parenchymal hyperintensities (two cases), periventricular parenchymal hyperintensities (one case), dilated perivascular spaces (six cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the number or type of abnormalities in cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No type of abnormality lateralized to the hemisphere from which the EEG spikes emanated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of association between MRI abnormalities and RE was 0.87, 95% CI: 0.18-4.33 after adjusting for potential demographic and technical factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that routine cranial MRI abnormalities are common in RE, but no more common than in controls, and not specific for RE </plain></SENT>
