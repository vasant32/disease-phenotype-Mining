<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the spectrum of clinical manifestations in children with benign focal sharp waves in the EEG to gain further insight into the genetic background of clinical and EEG symptomatology in a family study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 147 children (134 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, 13 without) met the following inclusion criteria: (a) at least one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011196'>EEG with focal sharp waves</z:hpo> characteristic of benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsies</z:e>, and (b) at least 1 sibling investigated by EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The families were questioned orally or in writing regarding the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients' records were evaluated by a standardized scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The following types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> occurred: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002373'>febrile convulsions</z:hpo> (FC), afebrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic-clonic seizures</z:hpo> (GTCS), simple and (rarely) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002384'>complex partial seizures</z:hpo>; and rolandic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in the strict sense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were overrepresented (6%); there were no indications of lesional causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FC occurred in 38 children (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As compared with unselected cases of FC, complex symptoms were overrepresented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Family data suggested a maternal preponderance in the transmission of FC liability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Affected relatives of FC probands manifested FC more often than did relatives of probands without FC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Families of 32 patients with typical rolandic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (24% of the 134 probands with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>) showed no aggregation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, but did show variable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the entire sample, EEG investigations showed focal sharp waves in 11% of siblings aged 2-10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No relation existed between clinical symptomatology and sharp wave findings in siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 66% of probands, the EEG disclosed generalized genetic patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Siblings with generalized spike-waves (sw) and/or theta rhythm had focal sharp waves more often than those without sw and/or theta rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The phenotypic expression of the genetic anomaly underlying focal sharp waves shows considerable variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The clinical and EEG findings are in agreement with a multifactorial pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsies</z:e> with "benign" focal epileptiform sharp waves </plain></SENT>
