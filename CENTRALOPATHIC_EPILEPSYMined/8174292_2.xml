<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the relationship between cognitive function and CBZ therapy, auditory event-related potentials (P300) were examined in 23 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign Childhood Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spike</z:e> (BCECT) compared with 54 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were 1) the mean P300 latency in BCECT (368 +/- 29 msec) was significantly prolonged compared with that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (349 +/- 30 msec), but most individual patients showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2) The prolongation of P300 latency was greatest during the course of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3) On repeated examination of P300, P300 latency was found to gradually become shorter with age in spite of continuous CBZ therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At initiation of CBZ therapy, the P300 latency became shorter; on the other hand, P300 latency became shorter with the discontinuation of CBZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>4) The age-corrected P300 latency showed a significant positive correlation with the serum concentration of CBZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that CBZ therapy has both an undesirable effect (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> impairment) and a desirable effect (improvement of underlying dysfunction caused by epileptogenesis) on cognitive function </plain></SENT>
