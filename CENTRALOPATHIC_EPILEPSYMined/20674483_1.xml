<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 45 electroencephalograms of patients divided into two groups: those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BCECTS) and symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e> (SPE), following ILAE criteria (1989) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EEG data analyzed were: horizontal dipole discharges, double spike phenomenon, the extension of epileptiform discharges and background activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a predominance of horizontal dipole between patients with BCECTS compared with patients with SPE; however, this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was also no statistically significant difference between the two groups when the double spike phenomenon and the extension of discharges beyond the rolandic area were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The slower background activity in the SPE group was the only variable with statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed similarities between rolandic discharges of two different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only reliable parameter to differentiate the groups was the background activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that most EEG rolandic features are not pathognomonic of BCECTS, as they are related to the area of the discharges and not to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> syndrome itself </plain></SENT>
