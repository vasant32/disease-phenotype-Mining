<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several recent studies have shown that levetiracetam (LEV) can be beneficial in the treatment of children with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (RE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reports about the effectiveness of LEV in the treatment of children with the less benign variants in the spectrum of "benign" idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">focal epilepsies</z:e> are still rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the effect of LEV on interictal epileptiform discharges in these syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on LEV therapy in 32 children (mean age: 10.6 years, range: 4-14) with RE or variants like atypical benign idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e> of childhood (ABIPEC), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282512" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="LKS">Landau-Kleffner syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e>), and continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS) and in children with benign idiopathic focal epileptiform discharges of childhood (BIFEDC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo>, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, may be related to the pathological EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency &gt;50% and/or reduction in BIFEDC &gt;90% 3 months after having started LEV therapy were defined as responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average dose of LEV was 39 mg/kg body wt per day; LEV was given in monotherapy to 31.3% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 20 of 32 patients (62.5%) did benefit: 12 of 24 patients had a &gt;50% reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency; 2 of 24 patients (8.3%) were completely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free; 18 of 32 patients (56.3%) had a &gt;90% reduction in BIFEDC (including CSWS); 6 of 32 (18.8%) had an EEG completely free of epileptiform discharges; and 17 of 32 (53.1%) showed improvement in cognition and/or language functions and/or behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, LEV tended to be more helpful in atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsies</z:e> and other variants </plain></SENT>
