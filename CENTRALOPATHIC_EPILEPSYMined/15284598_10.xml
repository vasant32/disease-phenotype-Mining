<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 64-channel EEG and simultaneous 151-channel MEG of interictal spike activity in five children <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> having general and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>focal seizures</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A spatio-temporal multiple signal classification (MUSIC) analysis was performed on the spike data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sources having a complex spatio-temporal configuration as well as single stationary sources were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results for the EEG and MEG were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this group of five patients, both high resolution EEG and MEG revealed that in some cases sources well separated in space and time exist, whereas in other cases only single source activity can be resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For multiple sources, differences for EEG and MEG in timing and localization of activity suggest that sources are spatio-temporally distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sources can propagate from initial activity in the finger/hand area around the central sulcus down to the mouth/tongue area </plain></SENT>
