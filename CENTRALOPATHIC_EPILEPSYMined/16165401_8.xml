<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them underwent clinical and electroencephalographic examination at baseline and at 3- to 6-month intervals during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Psychometric assessment was performed at baseline and after 18 months of treatment with the WISC-III, Illinois Test of Psychomotor Abilities, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV, and Bender-Santucci test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Mann-Whitney U test was used to describe differences in the frequency of abnormal findings: (1) at initial evaluation, comparing patients with a matched group of 45 healthy controls, and (2) after 18 months of OXC monotherapy, as an individual follow-up in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive assessment at baseline revealed mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751265" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">learning disabilities</z:e> in 9% of patients and 7% of controls; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence quotient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, sustained cessation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> under medication was observed in 53% of patients; an additional 21% had some relapse but were subsequently rendered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free, 21% experienced a &gt;50% improvement, and 5% showed no improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Normalization of interictal epileptiform activity was observed in 58% of patients, 35% showed an improvement in the grade of electroencephalographic pathology, and 7% manifested no change at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial mildly weak scores in isolated cognitive domains did not deteriorate, and even improved in some cases, during the course of the study, with concomitant electroencephalographic improvement or normalization and effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that OXC is effective in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and normalizing electroencephalograms and seems to preserve cognitive functions and behavioral abilities as long-term monotherapy in children with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
