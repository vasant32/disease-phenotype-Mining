<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the EEG pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes</z:e> (BCECTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical and EEG data of 701 BCECTS patients with at least a 3 years follow-up were reviewed from 10 epilepsy centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were recorded in 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four different ictal EEG patterns (A-D) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent (pattern A) was characterized by low voltage activity of fast rhythmic spikes, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency, and occurred in 14 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pattern B (six patients) was constituted by a discharge of spikes intermixed with sharp waves increasing in frequency and amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pattern C (seven children) consisted of monomorphic theta which progressively formed a discharge increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pattern D (5 children) was characterized by a initial focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the electrical activity, followed by one of the three above described patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 21 out of 28 children, the initial ictal pattern, altered from one pattern to another one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No clinical or EEG feature was predictive of a specific ictal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We failed to identify a unique ictal EEG pattern in our patients with BCECTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of per-ictal features, e.g., initial EEG <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> or post-ictal slowing, is common and should not be interpreted with prejudice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Alteration of ictal EEG pattern from one to another is not in conflict with the diagnosis of BCECTS </plain></SENT>
