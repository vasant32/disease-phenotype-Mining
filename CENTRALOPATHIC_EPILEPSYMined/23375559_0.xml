<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated quantitative evidence for brain morphological variation associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> to provide insights into the neuroanatomical basis of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three independent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> groups were imaged at different stages: (a) near <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (n=16, mean age 9.3±1.6 years), (b) ∼9 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (n=9, mean age 15.8±2.3 years), and (c) ∼15 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (n=10, mean age 22.7±2.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-matched controls were imaged with each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole brain T1-weighted MRI was acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Voxel-based morphometry (groups a-c) and cortical thickness analyses (groups b and c) were undertaken within each group and for the groups combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and age was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: The voxel-based morphometry analysis indicated increased bilateral grey matter volume in the superior frontal gyrus, insula and right inferior frontal gyrus regions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the increase lessened with age of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cortical thickness analysis revealed thicker cortex in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> along middle and inferior frontal gyri bilaterally, left insula and bilateral supramarginal gyrus in the 9-year-after-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> group, that normalised with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of cortical thickness changes with age were greater in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> cases than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Increased cortical gray matter associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The decreasing magnitude of the effect with increasing age parallels the natural history of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The areas affected are consistent with neurocognitive dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
