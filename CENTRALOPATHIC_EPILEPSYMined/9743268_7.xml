<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We report the analysis of scalp topography and dipole modeling of the rolandic spikes in 6 patients suffering of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood</z:e> with extremely high amplitude SEP by tapping stimulation of the finger of the hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EEG and BESA analysis were performed for both rolandic spontaneous interictal spikes and high amplitude scalp activity evoked by tapping and electrical stimulation of the first finger of the right hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The evoked responses showed a <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> characterized by a rapid phase (spike) followed by a slow phase (slow wave) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spike presented an early small positive component followed by a main negative component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, dipole configuration and source localization were observed for both rolandic spikes and evoked high amplitude scalp responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dipole localization showed an overlap of spatial coordinates between rolandic and evoked spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the extremely high amplitude SEPs could be evoked spikes which probably had the same cortical generators of the spontaneous rolandic spikes </plain></SENT>
