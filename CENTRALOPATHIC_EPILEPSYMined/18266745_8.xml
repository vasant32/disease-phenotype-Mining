<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate cortical auditory function, including speech recognition, in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (BRE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen children, seven patients with BRE and seven matched controls, underwent audiometric and behavioral testing, simultaneous EEG recordings, and auditory-evoked potential recordings with speech and tones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Speech recognition was tested under multiple listening conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> speech recognition abilities in quiet, as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral and subcortical auditory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BRE patients performed significantly worse than controls when speech recognition was tested under adverse listening conditions, including background noise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five BRE patients who were impaired on two or more tests had centrotemporal spiking on awake EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant group differences in the latency or amplitude of early N100 cortical responses to speech or tones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the mismatch negativity, a preattentive index of cortical processing that is elicited passively, was absent or prolonged for speech, but not tones, in BRE patients as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Children with BRE demonstrated specific speech recognition impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our evoked potential findings indicate that these behavioral impairments reflect dysfunction of nonprimary auditory cortex and cannot be attributed solely to attention difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A possible association between auditory impairments and centrotemporal spiking (&gt;1/min) on awake EEG was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pattern of speech recognition impairments observed is a known risk factor for academic difficulties in school-age children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results underscore the importance of comprehensive auditory testing, using behavioral and electrophysiological measures, in children with BRE </plain></SENT>
