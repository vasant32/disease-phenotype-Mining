<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients from each clinical group were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-second epochs centered at the peak negativity of the sharp waves were analyzed from a referential montage during stage I sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The epochs from the two groups were compared using parametric and information theory analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information analysis determined the likelihood of correctly identifying the clinical group based on the IED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standard parametric, morphological and spectral analyses were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no significant difference in the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the sharp wave between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The after-going slow wave contained the greatest information that separated the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result was supported by morphological and spectral differences in the after-going slow wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Greater distinguishing information is held in the after-going slow wave than the sharp wave for the identification of clinical groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Information analysis may assist in differentiating clinical syndromes from EEG signals </plain></SENT>
