<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centrotemporal spikes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>) is characterized by an excellent prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drug therapy is necessary in only a minority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carbamazepine (CBZ) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> (PB) have been reported to cause electroclinical aggravation in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of drug-induced aggravation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> has never been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied 98 consecutive cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, examined at the Centre Saint Paul between 1984 and 1999; 82 patients had received one or more treatments, often successively and in association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found only one case of electroclinical aggravation with CBZ among 40 patients exposed to CBZ (35 in monotherapy, five in polytherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional case showed a marked EEG aggravation on CBZ + PB among 14 patients taking PB (nine with monotherapy and five with polytherapy), and PB was apparently responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient treated with valproate or <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi> showed aggravation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aggravation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs happens only rarely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is a minor risk of aggravation with CBZ and also probably with PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Drug-induced aggravation may occur only during certain periods coinciding with spontaneous worsening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
