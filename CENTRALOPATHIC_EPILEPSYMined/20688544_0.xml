<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 29 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> were included in the Dutch Study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> in Childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each child was followed for 5 years, and subsequently contacted 12-17 years after enrolment to complete a structured questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty children had typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, nine had atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> (age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> &lt;4 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> or learning difficulties at inclusion, other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types, atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was 8.0 years with slight male preponderance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-types before enrolment were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic-clonic seizures</z:hpo> (GTCS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002349'>simple partial seizures</z:hpo>; in 86% of the children <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> occurred during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 12-17 years, 96% had a terminal remission (TR(F)) of more than 5 years and 89% of more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was 2.7 years; mean age at reaching TR(F) was 10.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many children (63%) had experienced one or more (secondary) GTCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">Antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs were used by 79% of the children with a mean duration of 3.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the children seemed to have developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851265" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">learning problems</z:e> or an arrest of cognitive development during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in patient characteristics or outcome between children with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> and children with atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children in our cohort, both those with typical and atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, had a very good prognosis with high remission rates after 12-17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the predictive factors for disease course and outcome observed in earlier studies (other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) were prognostic in our cohort </plain></SENT>
