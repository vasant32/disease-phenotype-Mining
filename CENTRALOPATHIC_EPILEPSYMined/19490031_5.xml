<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In order to sequentially analyze the fMRI images acquired during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, a continuous series of echo planar imaging (EPI) scans covering the complete period of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> was acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were segmented into 10-s blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each block, representing a unique experimental condition, was contrasted with a neutral (no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>) baseline condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual comparison of the activations from one block to the next highlighted the course of activations and deactivations during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This analysis was applied to three independent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> of one patient with peri-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>: one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery and two after unsuccessful tailored resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Observations were compared to results from invasive subdural electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), and independent component analysis (ICA), a model-free method of BOLD-signal analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The initial increase in BOLD signal occurred 10-40 s before clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the same location compared to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> zone determined by invasive subdural evaluation and SISCOM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequential involvement of cortical and subcortical structures was in agreement with SISCOM, intracranial EEG recordings, and ICA results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In selected patients, sequential analysis of changes in BOLD signal induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> might represent a useful approach for investigating the temporal development of brain activity during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, thereby allowing imaging of those cerebral structures involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> generation and propagation </plain></SENT>
