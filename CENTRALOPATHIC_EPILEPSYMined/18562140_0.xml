<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1998 to 2006, 14/242 patients with benign children <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centrotemporal spikes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>) were diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e> with ENM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 patients, we performed video-EEG monitoring along with tests with the patient's arms outstretched; 6/14 patients were also simultaneously underwent surface electromyogram (EMG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ENM manifestations, electrophysiological features, and responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, ENM developed after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug therapy, and the appearance of ENM were corresponding to EEG findings of high-amplitude spikes followed by a slow wave in the contralateral motor areas with secondary generalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was further confirmed by time-locked silent EMG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During ENM occurrence or recurrence, habitual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and interictal discharges were exaggerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some patients, the changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug regimens in relation to ENM appearance included add-on therapy with carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> or withdrawal of valproate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ENM was controlled in most cases by administration of various combinations of valproate, clonazepam, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of ENM or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e> in our center was approximately 5.79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A combination of video-EEG monitoring with the patient's arms outstretched and EMG is essential to identify ENM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The aggravation of habitual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and interictal discharges indicate ENM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs, such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi>, may be related to ENM occurrence during spontaneous aggravation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Various combinations of valproate, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> are relatively effective for treating ENM that occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e> </plain></SENT>
