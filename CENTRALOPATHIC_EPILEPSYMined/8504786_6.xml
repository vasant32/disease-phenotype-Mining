<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The morphologic features of the rolandic spike-and-wave complex were identical in the five clinical categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, a quantitative description of the rolandic spike-and-wave complex can be given that is valid for the 43 children of the present study, although they represent a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of associated clinical syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rolandic spike appeared to be not a spike but a sharp wave with a mean duration of 88 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the opinion of several investigators, the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the rolandic spike does not provide a clue to its "epileptogenicity" or to the presence or absence of an organic cerebral lesion in the individual child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, additional information (background activity of the EEG, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain) is needed to determine the significance of rolandic spikes occurring in the EEG of a child with respect to the probability of a cerebral lesion and the prognosis in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
