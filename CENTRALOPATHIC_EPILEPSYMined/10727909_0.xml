<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which age modifies the appearance of centrotemporal spikes and giant SEPs in these children, are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of SEPs were studied in a group of 18 subjects (10 males and 8 females, aged 7.1-17.2 years) with sleep-enhanced centrotemporal spikes, with or without BECT and the results were compared with those obtained from a group of age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Giant SEPs were recorded in 6 subjects and, in 3 of these, EEG spikes evoked by hand tapping were obtained also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No subjects with giant SEPs were found in subjects older than 12 years, and an age-related decrease in amplitude of giant SEPs as this age approached was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, at repeated SEP recordings, a clear trend towards a more important reduction in amplitude of giant SEPs over the temporal and parietal than over the central regions was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study of EEG spikes evoked by hand tapping showed a striking similarity between the averaged evoked spikes and the main negative component of giant SEPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also possible to observe that the spike negative peak recorded over the central areas always preceded the same component recorded over the parietal and temporal areas by 5-15 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study seems to support the idea that giant SEPs in subjects with centrotemporal spikes are generated by a complex mechanism different from that at the basis of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> N60 component of SEPs; they also show peculiar age-related modifications which can be interpreted in terms of maturational changes of brain excitability/inhibition and probably constitute a tool for monitoring the clinical course of BECT, when present </plain></SENT>
