<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not yet known whether these deficits are reversible or have long-term impact on the development of language skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on a study conducted in 13 patients in remission from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> and 13 age-matched controls, who underwent neuropsychological assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during a verb generation task, to determine cortical lateralization of language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> group showed significant language deficits compared to controls as well as a pattern of atypical ERP lateralization in frontal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings support the view that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> in childhood may lead to enduring effects on brain maturation and language development </plain></SENT>
