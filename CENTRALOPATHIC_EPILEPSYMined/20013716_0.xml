<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiments conducted in cats suggest that this pattern can only appear if there is bilateral thalamic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether thalamic hypoperfusion is associated with the complicated variants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 24 children were studied over a period of six years following their first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up an interictal magnetic resonance scan and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerised tomography (SPECT) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were examined to ascertain whether there were asymmetries in the distribution of cerebral blood flow through structures, using parametric statistical maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brain SPECT was performed when progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atypical benign partial epilepsy</z:e> in infancy was diagnosed and in typical forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> when there was some mild neuropsychological deficit that led the specialist to suspect the existence of a focal cortical lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bilateral thalamic hypoperfusion was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atypical benign partial epilepsy</z:e> in infancy, which was correlated with the presence of continuous spike-waves during the slow-wave phase of non-REM sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral thalamic hypoperfusion seems to be a necessary condition for the atypical progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
