<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 11 patients (7-15 years of age) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous EEG and flash evoked potentials were recorded from 19 channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following visual stimulation, five of the patients displayed a late sustained component over temporal and central scalp regions (mean latency: 194.8 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of this component was related to the spectra of spontaneous EEG and clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant topographical differences were observed between the EEG amplitude spectra of patients with and without a N200 component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects were most evident in the lower alpha (7.5-9.5 Hz) and beta band (13-15 Hz) when temporal, parietal and occipital regions of the left and right hemisphere were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also a tendency that children without N200 displayed more hypersynchroneous activity in the spontaneous EEG than children with N200 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests a protective role of focal interictal spikes, and probably coincides with a benign prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
