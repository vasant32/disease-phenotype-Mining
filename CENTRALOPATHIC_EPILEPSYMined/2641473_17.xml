<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to examine the generator configuration of this focus, we investigated the variation of spike topography in 20 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> of childhood by the dipole localization method (DLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A quantitative measure ("stability index" or SI) of the degree of source fluctuation was devised, based on the consistency of the source parameters (location, direction and magnitude) over contiguous time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high SI was associated with overlapping source locations and parallel directions over many time points, while a low SI was seen with poor and variable solutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the peak and trough of the spike, the corresponding sources were found to have different locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the patients were separated into those with and without neurological findings, the mean times at which stable sources existed were significantly different: 35 and 150 ms respectively after the spike apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, the group without abnormal neurological findings tended to have higher values of SI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that such stability analysis allows measurement of the spatial and temporal extents of source estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results further support the hypothesis that the topographic behaviour of a spike focus is closely associated with its clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
