<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to evaluate the incidence of a possible combination of rolandic and absence signs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> children, which remains a subject of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The medical files and electroencephalographic (EEG) records of children with rolandic, childhood absence, and juvenile <z:mp ids='MP_0003216'>absence epilepsy</z:mp> were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the antiepilepsy treatment, 6 of 66 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, most of them with initial carbamazepine therapy, had absences and generalized spike-wave discharges of a secondarily generalized type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five cases of 34 children with childhood <z:mp ids='MP_0003216'>absence epilepsy</z:mp> and 3 of 11 patients with juvenile <z:mp ids='MP_0003216'>absence epilepsy</z:mp> were identified with an EEG focus of the rolandic type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We considered the likely relation of absence features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> to the treatment or to an atypical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of a rolandic focus in <z:mp ids='MP_0003216'>absence epilepsies</z:mp>, however, makes the coincidence of these entirely distinct phenomena, even if very rare, not excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to elucidate a probable genetic or functional link between partial and primarily generalized EEG discharges in the idiopathic childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
