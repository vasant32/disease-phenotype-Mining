<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Some children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> have associated neuropsychiatric deficits resembling symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>), the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical overlap between both syndromes has received relatively little attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study examines the frequency of rolandic spikes in nonepileptic children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> and compares it with a historic control group of 3,726 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> school-aged children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> patients with and without discharges are compared regarding age at admission, sex, global functioning, and distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The EEGs of 483 ADHD outpatients between 2 and 16 years meeting diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV) were evaluated prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If rolandic spikes were present, separate sleep EEGs were performed to exclude a bioelectrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> during slow-wave sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Rolandic spikes were detected in the EEGs of 27 children (5.6%; 22 boys and five girls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> rate during follow-up tended to be larger in children with rolandic spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> patients with and without spikes regarding sex and global functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> children with rolandic spikes came to our attention significantly earlier than did children without discharges and tended to exhibit more <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp>-impulsive symptoms, evidenced in a larger proportion of the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> combined type than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> inattentive type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of rolandic spikes in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> is significantly higher than expected from epidemiologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The question arises how <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> symptoms are related to rolandic spikes in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Possibly rolandic discharges or underlying, not fully understood mechanisms of epileptogenesis decrease the vulnerability threshold, advance the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, or aggravate the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
