<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 2 out of 31 cases of parietal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> "with evoked spikes" are siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present the clinical and EEG characteristics of a brother and sister who suffer from this rare form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and those of their younger sister, not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e>, who shows "podalic" evoked spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An older sister has spontaneous spikes but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These phenomena are not found in their parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two siblings show a very similar clinical and EEG evolution; in fact, both suffered initially from parietal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> "with evoked spikes" and, after two years of this form, they developed temporo-central (or rolandic) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> "with evoked spikes" that still persists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their intellectual development is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but their scholastic performance is rather poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The youngest sister, who presents only evoked "podalic" spikes, has a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intellectual development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of the most accepted hypotheses as to the nature of evoked spikes is that in a particular period of childhood an area of cortical functional deafferentation occurs, which disappears with further maturation of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
