<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Speech problems were present in BRE patients and worsened after medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The error pattern of laryngeal articulation in BRE was exclusively the substitution of stop consonants, and these errors increased after medication (6% vs 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, the variation in acoustic parameters after carbamazepine was similar to the hypokinetic pattern of articulation abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that BRE patients treated with carbamazepine should be monitored for language and speech problems </plain></SENT>
