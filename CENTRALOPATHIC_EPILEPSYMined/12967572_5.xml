<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the spatial and temporal relationship between bilateral foci of bilaterally synchronous discharges in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood</z:e> (BREC) using a whole-scalp neuromagnetometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We simultaneously recorded interictal magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in six children with BREC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interictal spikes were classified into three groups: bilaterally synchronous discharges (BSDs), unilateral discharges on right side (UD-R), and unilateral discharges on left side (UD-L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used equivalent current dipole (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>) modelling to analyse the cortical sources of interictal spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both BSDs and UDs were found in Patients 1-4, whereas only UDs were identified in Patients 5 and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECDs</z:mp> of interictal spikes were located in rolandic regions, 10-20mm anterior and lateral to hand somatosensory cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multi-dipole analysis of BSDs showed two <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECDs</z:mp> in homotopic motor areas of the hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During BSDs, the right-sided activation preceded the left-sided activation by 15-21 milliseconds in Patients 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Patients 3 and 4, the activation occurred 17-20 milliseconds earlier in the left than the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the same hemisphere, the sources of BSDs and UDs were located in similar areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results imply the cortical epileptogenicity in bilateral perirolandic areas in BREC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sequential activation during BSDs in both hemispheres suggest the existence of synaptic connections, possibly via the corpus callosum, between bilateral irritative foci </plain></SENT>
