<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical literature has suggested that while the clinical features and presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> in children (BREC) are known, the neuronal mechanism of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> focus is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Classification of clinical subtypes is usually made by determining whether there are supplementary clinical signs of brain damage, in which case the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> is classified as non-benign or "atypical" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies of EEG findings in BREC have suggested that the source of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> is in the Rolandic fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated dipole source modelling in 24 children, comparing the results of one and two dipole models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that atypical BREC patients have a more complex distribution of dipoles and that single dipole fits may be more predictive of typical BREC than multiple dipole fits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The implications of these results are discussed </plain></SENT>
