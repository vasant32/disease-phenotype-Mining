<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the intelligence quotient (IQ) profiles, especially the language abilities, in Chinese children with BCECTS and to investigate whether there is a relationship between clinical factors and disorders of cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in Chinese children with BCECTS, although the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient is within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between spike wave index (SWI) and language deficits in children with BCECTS, but the deficits are not dependent on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, disease course, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency, spike location or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is important that children with typical BCECTS undergo regular clinical investigations about language performance in order to start necessary interventions as early as possible </plain></SENT>
