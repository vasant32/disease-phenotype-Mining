<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a detailed localization analysis of spontaneous magnetic brain activities in seven BECRS patients using magnetoencephalography (MEG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had BECRS diagnosis with typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and electroencephalographic findings and five patients had minor psychomotor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEG was recorded over both parieto-temporal regions using a 2x37-channel biomagnetic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The collected data were digitally bandpass-filtered (2-6, 14-30, or 1-70 Hz) to analyze slow- and fast-wave magnetic activities and rolandic spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Slow-wave activity was increased in four hemispheres of three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased fast-wave activity was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients with minor neuropsychological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of increased fast-wave magnetic brain activity appeared to cause functional anomalies in the higher brain function processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the spike analysis, the dipoles of rolandic spikes which constantly manifested anterior positivity in direction were concentrated in the superior rolandic region in four cases and the inferior rolandic region in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The localizations of increased slow- and fast-wave activities were identical with those of the spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> profiles were frequently characterized by the spike locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Source localizations of the focal brain activities and rolandic spikes by MEG will contribute to the different diagnosis and pathophysiological elucidation of BECRS </plain></SENT>
