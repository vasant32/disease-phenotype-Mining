<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since the first descriptions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic Epilepsy</z:e> or benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centrotemporal spikes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>), typical and atypical forms have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indeed, classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>focal seizures</z:hpo> are sometimes associated with various atypical ictal symptoms and cognitive or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004930" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an effort to define early clinical and EEG criteria allowing early distinction between typical and atypical forms, we recently conducted a prospective study in a cohort of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic Epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of this study have been reported elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We now discuss the semiological characteristics, and comment on the video-EEG data collected during this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were classified into three major categories: "classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>focal seizures</z:hpo>"; "spike and wave related symptoms"; and "paraictal symptoms" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>focal seizures</z:hpo> constitute the electroclinical expression of the development and the propagation of a focal cortical neuronal discharge. "Spike and wave related symptoms" are brief neurological or neuropsychological phenomena having a relatively strict temporal relation with individual components of isolated focal or generalized spikes and waves. "Paraictal symptoms" consist of acquired progressive and fluctuating motor or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> and are not directly correlated with Todd <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We present detailed video-EEG material of selected cases and discuss the usefulness of such distinctions in terminology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that variability in clinical expression probably reflects the implication of different pathophysiological mechanisms, which in turn could explain differences in sensitivity to treatment </plain></SENT>
