<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We present a social marketing conceptual framework for Experience Corps Baltimore City (EC) in which the desired health outcome is not the promoted product or behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate the feasibility of a social marketing-based recruitment campaign for the first year of the Baltimore Experience Corps Trial (BECT), a randomized, controlled trial of the health benefits of EC participation for older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited older adults from the Baltimore, MD, area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants randomized to the intervention were placed in public schools in volunteer roles designed to increase healthy behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the effectiveness of a recruitment message that appealed to generativity (i.e., to make a difference for the next generation), rather than potential health benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 155 participants recruited in the first year of the BECT, the average age was 69 years; 87% were women and 85% were African American </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants reported primarily generative motives as their reason for interest in the BECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions embedded in civic engagement have the potential to engage older adults who might not respond to a direct appeal to improve their health </plain></SENT>
