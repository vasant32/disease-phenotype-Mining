<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients with ESES were evaluated and treated in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine children had continuous spike and wave during slow-wave sleep (CSWS)/ESES syndrome, 3 had Atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> (benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centrotemporal spikes), 1 had Opercular syndrome, and 1 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282512" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="LKS">Landau-Kleffner syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The duration of ESES ranged from 6 to 52 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 13 children (53%) showed evidence of borderline to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 28 EEG findings of ESES were analyzed for SWI (spike-wave index) </plain></SENT>
