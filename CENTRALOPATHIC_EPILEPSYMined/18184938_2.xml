<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six untreated children (5 boys, 1 girl) with a mean (standard deviation) age of 9.1 years (1.5 years) underwent overnight ambulatory electroencephalograph recording and neuropsychologic evaluation at baseline and after 6 months of sulthiame monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Reliable Change Index was used to determine whether a statistically reliable change in neuropsychologic function occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children continued receiving sulthiame monotherapy (dose range, 8.0-9.3 mg/kg per day) for the study period without further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although spike frequency was reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 children (3 showing a decrease to less than 10% of baseline), they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> demonstrated significant deterioration in their reading ability, 5 had significant declines in general memory, and more than half had reduction in attention skills and mathematics ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although sulthiame was effective at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control and significantly reduced spike frequency in children, it was also associated with deterioration in cognitive function </plain></SENT>
