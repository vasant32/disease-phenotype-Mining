<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of this analysis may help elucidate the dilemma whether or not to treat the child after the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> from our department (aged 3-11 years) were analyzed as candidates to be enrolled in a prospective multicenter randomized double-blind placebo controlled study on therapeutic efficacy of sulthiame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four of 39 children were not treated after the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four children were lost from the study, thus 30 children were included in final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, the parents were instructed to apply <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> rectal solution in case of second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, and were warned to observe the child, particularly during the first sleep and before awaking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty of 30 (66.6%) children experienced second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> within six months of the first one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some of these children entered the group treated with sulthiame vs. placebo, and those who did not meet the criteria for sulthiame group were treated with carbamazepine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten of 30 (33.4%) children did not experience second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> within six months of the first one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In only one of them, the second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> occurred 14 months of the first one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> status did not appear as second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, irrespective of whether or not the children received rectal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, a high incidence of second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> was recorded within six months of the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, whereas the rate of second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> after six months of the first one was very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The probability of the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> status in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> could be neglected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results may be viewed as a small contribution to clarifying the dilemma of whether or not, and when to treat children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because of the high incidence of second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, we decided to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> after the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
