<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six children with BECT with a left-sided focus (BECT-L), 6 children with BECT with a right-sided focus (BECT-R), and 12 control children were tested in verbal, visual-spatial, and visual-attention tasks, with visual hemifield presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Children with BECT-R were impaired in the visual-spatial task relative to those with BECT-L, and the typical left-hemisphere (LH) advantage was not reported in the verbal task in children with BECT-L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the classic global superiority effect was lacking in children with BECT-R, which may be due to impaired performance of the right hemisphere specialized in global (vs local)-level processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data argue for the deleterious effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> discharges per se on cognitive functions in the developing brain, and the decisive role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> focus lateralization in specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> and hemispheric specialization </plain></SENT>
