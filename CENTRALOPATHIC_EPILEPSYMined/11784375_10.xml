<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this research is to analyse patients in whom carbamazepine (CBZ) therapy adversely affected electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> exacerbation and to identify risk factors for these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From a total number of 2191 patients (p.) included in the Municipal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> Center (MEC) database, 77 patients with spike-and-wave (SW) discharges while on CBZ treatment have been selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient population was divided in two groups: (i) patients who were already receiving CBZ at the time of their first visit to the MEC; and (ii) patients to whom CBZ was prescribed during follow-up at the MEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBZ was discontinued in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with confirmed evidence of an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency, or with no improvement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, EEG findings as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical changes were duly recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 1: Carbamazepine was discontinued in 17 patients (p.) as a result of paradoxical reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This condition occurs when an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug (AED) appears to exacerbate a type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> against which it is usually effective, or when it leads to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of new types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three p. were withdrawn because of inappropriate drug selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group 2: CBZ was discontinued in six patients (p.) as a result of paradoxical reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The paradoxical reaction was more frequent in patients with frontal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and generalized SW discharges on the EEG (P=0.09) and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (BRE) with diffuse interictal sharp and slow-wave discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In both groups, clinical and electrical changes returned to their initial status upon CBZ withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this study, it may be concluded that EEGs might eventually help to screen high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If EEG recordings become substantially worse, with more frequent and longer generalized SW bursts after initiation of CBZ therapy, patients should be carefully monitored in order to detect any sign of clinical impairment </plain></SENT>
