<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty children and adolescents aged between 9 and 15 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were divided into two groups: G1 - patients with RE (n=20) - and G2 - healthy controls without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were assessed with the Quick Neurological Screening Test (QNST II) - clinical trial to search for NSS -, and the WISC III - neuropsychological test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistical difference between groups was found in WISC III and QNST II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, children with poorer motor skills had worse performance in the QNST II and also in the execution intelligence quotient - IQ (p=0.001) and in total IQ (p=0.004), thus showing a positive correlation between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The QNST II is a good screening tool for the neurologist to detect abnormalities in fine motor skills </plain></SENT>
