<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyse the epidemiological, clinical and developmental characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> as an aid to its suspected diagnosis in daily clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 56 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> were reviewed in order to collect epidemiological and clinical features, results of complementary examinations and developmental data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The criteria defined by the International League Against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> (ILAE) were used in the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 7.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 62.5 % were diagnosed at school age, with a higher prevalence of males (58.9 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> occurred during sleep in 84.4 % of patients, and they were mainly characterised by <z:hpo ids='HP_0007332'>hemifacial seizures</z:hpo> with eye deviation and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> (76.8 %), <z:mp ids='MP_0000622'>hypersalivation</z:mp> (44.6 %), guttural sounds (30.6 %), secondary generalised tonic-clonic (35.7 %) and/or unilateral clonic or tonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (26.8 %), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> (17.9 %) and unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesias</z:hpo> (16.1 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inter-ictal EEG showed paroxysms in the centrotemporal regions, frequently unilateral (78.6 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recurrences, 50.7 % occurred during the first 12 months after diagnosis, 24.6 % between 12 and 24 months after diagnosis, and 24.6 % between 2 and 4 years of follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients with atypical progression were recorded: a case with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with continuous spikes and waves during slow-wave sleep, and another case with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282512" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="LKS">Landau-Kleffner syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> is a common type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in the pediatric age group and generally begins at school-aged children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its semiological sequence is fairly characteristic, and finding centrotemporal spikes is considered as necessary for the syndromic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prognosis is excellent; however, as a few patients may progress to atypical outcomes and/or neuropsychological deficits, a rigorous developmental control of these patients should be of the highest priority </plain></SENT>
