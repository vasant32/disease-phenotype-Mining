<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Children were assessed using the School Performance Test; questionnaires on learning difficulties administered to parents and teachers; the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition; and EEGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Absolute and relative amplitudes in the classic bands (quantitative EEG) and characteristics of epileptiform activity on the EEG were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Educational problems were observed in 7 (18.4%) children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this subgroup, relative alpha amplitudes at the central and parietal electrodes were lower as compared with those of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> subgroup with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> educational performance and a control group matched for age, gender, and socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data indicated a possible relationship between alterations in background brain electrical activity and the tendency toward inferior educational performance in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggested that quantitative EEGs are a possible physiological tool in the assessment of cognitive aspects in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
