<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report presents a description of newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, with a special emphasis on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndromes, in a large, prospectively ascertained community-based cohort evaluated and diagnosed in the mid-1990s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Children, aged 0 through 15 years at the time of the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, were prospectively identified at the time of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> through the practices of 16 of the 17 child neurologists in Connecticut as well as five adult neurologists and seven pediatricians from January 1993 through December 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parents were interviewed, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant medical records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndromes was done for each child by each of three pediatric neurologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Discrepancies were resolved in conference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 613 children was recruited into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age at time of the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> was 5.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Half the cohort was boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen percent had a remote symptomatic etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> syndromes were classifiable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but four children, although some syndromes are, by definition, relatively nonspecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> cohort, 58.6% of the syndromes were localization related, 29.0% generalized, and 12.4% undetermined as to whether focal or generalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> occurred in 10% of the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Primarily generalized syndromes accounted for 20.6%, with childhood absence being the single most common syndrome in this subgroup (12.1% of the cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Secondarily generalized syndromes accounted for 8.5% of the total, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infantile spasms</z:e> being the most common in this grouping (3.9% of the cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a description of childhood- and adolescent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> as it is diagnosed and evaluated in the 1990s in one state in the United State and based on current classification guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results should be generalizable to the rest of the country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of early identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndromes will be determined through subsequent follow-up of this cohort </plain></SENT>
