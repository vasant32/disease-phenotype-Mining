<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of several factors - laterality of discharges, age-at-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and medication - on these cognitive functions was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group of 29 children with BCECTS was evaluated using standardized tests performed in routine clinical practice and specifically designed to assess executive and attentional functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This group obtained mean scores significantly lower than normative means specifically for tasks involving attention control processes, i.e. cognitive flexibility and inhibitory processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>-related factors that we studied nor the medication appeared to influence performance of these tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest an impact of BCECTS on attentional processes, the most affected being attention control processes that develop late </plain></SENT>
