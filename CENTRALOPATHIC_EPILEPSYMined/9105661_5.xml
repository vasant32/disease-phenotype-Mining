<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Motor cortical excitability was studied using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 10 age-matched controls, and 13 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes</z:e> (BECT), with a mean age of 11.2 +/- 2.0 years (five untreated, and eight treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9925">sodium valproate</z:chebi> (VPA) and well controlled) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Motor evoked potentials (<z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEPs</z:chebi>) elicited by TMS through a circular coil were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) while relaxed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in latency or duration of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEPs</z:chebi>, or central motor conduction time among controls, untreated and treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The threshold intensity for TMS in the untreated patients (63.0 +/- 14.8%, mean +/- SD) was similar to that in controls (63.0 +/- 12.5%), while the threshold intensity in the treated patients (79.4 +/- 11.8%) was significantly higher than that in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in threshold intensity (15 +/- 4.1%) was also observed in the untreated patients retested after starting VPA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects occurred during TMS in any subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, motor cortical hyperexcitability in BECT was not recognized in the present TMS study, while VPA was confirmed to have an effect on the threshold intensity for TMS </plain></SENT>
