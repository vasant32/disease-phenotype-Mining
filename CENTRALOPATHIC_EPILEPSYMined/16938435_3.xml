<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is, however, no general agreement on the exact profile of functions disturbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to identify significant deficits in spatial perception and memory in children with BCECTS (ages 6-10 years) compared with healthy controls matched for age, sex and socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological test battery administered consisted of the HAWIK-III, the "TÃ¼binger Luria Christensen Neuropsychological Test Set for Children", the "Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children" and the "Differential Neuropsychological Test" </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children with BCECTS exhibited significant deficits in higher functions of spatial perception, including spatial orientation, as well as in basal and complex spatial memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deficits were independent of the lateralization of the epileptogenic foci and independent of anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> drug treatment </plain></SENT>
