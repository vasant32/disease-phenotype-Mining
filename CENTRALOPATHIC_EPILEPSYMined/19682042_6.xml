<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mild cognitive and behavioral difficulties are increasingly recognized in the course of BRE and should not be considered as atypical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Atypical features are recognized on electroclinical grounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These features, particularly early age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and frequent spikes or spike-wave discharges, seem to be risk factors for neuropsychological deficits but also for an atypical evolution of BRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atypical evolutions of BRE are defined by the appearance of severe neuropsychological impairments and continuous spike-and-waves during slow sleep (CSWSS) </plain></SENT>
