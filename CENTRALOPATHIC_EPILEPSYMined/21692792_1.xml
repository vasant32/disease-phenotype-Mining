<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcome is usually excellent, but there are some atypical forms of BCECTS with less favorable outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to delineate the frequency of these atypical features among patients with BCECTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart study by retrieving the medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients with BCECTS who were evaluated in four pediatric neurology outpatient clinics in Israel between the years 1991 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Key FINDINGS: A total of 196 patients with BCECTS were identified (78 female and 118 male; mean age at time of diagnosis 7.64 years, range 1.5-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 4.43 years (range 2-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (4.6%) developed electrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> in slow waves sleep (ESES) during follow-up, four (2%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282512" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="LKS">Landau-Kleffner syndrome</z:e>, three (1.5%) had BCECTS with frequent refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, two (1%) had BCECTS with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> at presentation, one (0.5%) had a "classic" atypical variant, and one (0.5%) had oromotor dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None had rolandic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients (31%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>), 43 (21.9%) had specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo>, and 23 (11.7%) had behavioral abnormalities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorders, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>pervasive developmental disorder</z:hpo> (PDD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: The prevalence of most atypical forms of BCECTS other than ESES is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is, however, a high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> and specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> among patients with BCECTS </plain></SENT>
