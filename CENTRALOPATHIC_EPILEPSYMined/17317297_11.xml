<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To localize the irritative zone in children by combined spike-related fMRI and EEG multiple source analysis (MSA) in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Interictal spikes were averaged and localized using MSA, and source locations were displayed in the anatomical 3D-MRI in 11 patients (5-12 yrs, median 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interictal spikes were additionally recorded during the fMRI acquisition (EEG-fMRI), and the fMRI sequences were correlated off-line with the EEG spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MSA revealed an initial central dipole in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, including the face or hand area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second dipolar source was mostly consistent with propagated activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BOLD activations from EEG-fMRI, consistent with the locations of the initial dipoles, were found in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found additional large areas of BOLD activations in 3 of these subjects extending into the sylvian fissure and the insula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These were identified as propagated activity by MSA using the short time differences in the source waveforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MSA provided reliable localization of the spike <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> zone in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using the combination of EEG-fMRI and MSA we were able to discriminate the spike <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> zone from propagated epileptiform source activity, using the spatial resolution of the EEG-fMRI technique and the temporal resolution of the MSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the sensitivity of the EEG-fMRI technique was low and further improvements of the technique are warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that a combination of EEG-fMRI and MSA may be a powerful tool to describe the irritative zone of patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">focal epilepsies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies in patients with non-idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">focal epilepsies</z:e> may clarify whether both techniques can be used as complementary clinical tools to localize the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of interictal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">focal epilepsies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
