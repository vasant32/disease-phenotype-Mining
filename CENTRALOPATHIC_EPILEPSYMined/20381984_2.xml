<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported a higher incidence of learning and behavioral difficulties in association with frontal lobe dysfunctions in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BCECTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied serial changes in frontal and prefrontal lobe volumes using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging in BCECTS with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo> and evaluated correlations between prefrontal lobe growth and active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial changes in regional cerebral volumes were measured in two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo> (BCECTS(+)) and five patients without neuropsychiatric deficits (BCECTS(-)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (4-13years old) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Volumes of the frontal and prefrontal lobes were determined using a workstation, and the prefrontal-to-frontal lobe volume ratio was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frontal and prefrontal lobe volumes revealed growth disturbance in BCECTS(+) compared with BCECTS(-) and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, prefrontal-to-frontal lobe volume ratio increased serially in BCECTS(-) similarly to controls, but was stagnant or decreased in BCECTS(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prefrontal growth also revealed more rapid recovery in a BCECTS(+) patient with shorter active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that longer active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> period as frequent spike-waves coupled with the occurrence of frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> may be associated with prefrontal lobe growth disturbance, which relates to neuropsychological problems </plain></SENT>
