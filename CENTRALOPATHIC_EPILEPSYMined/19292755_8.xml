<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>) is the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndrome of childhood and can be associated with language difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact profile of these difficulties and their neurofunctional underpinnings, however, are not yet clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To further understand the impact of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> syndrome on language, we assessed language performance using standard neuropsychological measures, and patterns of language lateralization using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in children with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The fMRI analyses revealed that language-related activation was less lateralized to the left hemisphere in anterior brain regions in the patients relative to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding was consistent with decreased performance in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> group compared to the control group on the neuropsychological measure most dependent on the integrity of anterior aspects of the language axis, namely, sentence production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The converging lines of evidence from the neuropsychological and activation methodologies support the view that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> is associated with language difficulties that are regional, and anterior, in nature </plain></SENT>
