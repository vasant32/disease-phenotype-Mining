<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 15 cases the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> last for more than 30 min up to 6 h </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autonomic symptoms were apparent in 25, head deviation in 24 and hemiconvulsion or generalization in 17 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten children reported visual symptoms </plain></SENT>
