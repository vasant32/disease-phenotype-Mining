<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A considerable proportion of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BCECTS) have increasingly been found to show neuropsychiatric deficits such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100710'>impulsivity</z:hpo>, possibly associated with frontal lobe dysfunctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based brain volumetry to characterize serial changes in frontal and prefrontal lobe volumes and compare volumetric changes with clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial changes in regional cerebral volumes were measured in a 5-year-old boy with BCECTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were not easily controlled, and he demonstrated oromotor deficits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive and behavioral deficits persisted even after remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorder and oromotor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two BCECTS patients (5-6 years old) without neuropsychological disorders served as typical BCECTS, and nine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (4-10 years old) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Volumes of the frontal and prefrontal lobes were determined using a workstation, and prefrontal to frontal lobe volume ratio was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frontal and prefrontal lobe volumes showed no growth even after remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prefrontal to frontal lobe volume ratio reduced slightly even after remission of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorders and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The result suggests that BCECTS presenting with atypical course may be associated with frontal lobe dysfunction resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
