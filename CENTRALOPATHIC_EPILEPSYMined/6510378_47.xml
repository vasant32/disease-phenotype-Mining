<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A stereotypic dipole field was present along the rolandic region in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During its most prominent phase, the negative pole of the dipole was maximum at the centrotemporal region, with the positive pole involving the bifrontal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A hypothesis is proposed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> discharges arise from a single generator which is oriented tangential to the surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The generator is most likely situated in the lower rolandic region where the zero potential zone exists, between the frontal positivity and the centrotemporal negativity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Identification of this dipole configuration may be useful for differentiating BREC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">focal epilepsy</z:e> of other etiologies </plain></SENT>
