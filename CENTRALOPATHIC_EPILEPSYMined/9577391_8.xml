<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied six patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood</z:e> with central temporal spikes who presented so-called 'extreme somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs)' following peripheral somatosensory stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stimuli were delivered to the fingers of one hand using both a triggered tendon hammer and low-intensity electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The electrical stimulation was delivered in sequences in different conditions (i.e. random order, 1, 3 and 10 Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both tapping and electrical stimulation produced scalp evoked potentials in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, characterized by a spike followed by a slow wave, similar in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and scalp distribution to the spontaneously occurring spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paroxysmal activity was sensitive to stimulus rate; the number of evoked spikes was inversely related to the frequency of stimulation, being maximal at 1 Hz and disappearing at high frequencies (10 Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous spikes disappeared during high-frequency stimulation but were present during low-frequency stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Averaged SEPs at 3-Hz stimulation showed a late high-amplitude component, identical in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and distribution to the single evoked spike </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore conclude that, in these subjects, the so-called 'extreme SEPs' are evoked spikes and that evoked and spontaneous spikes share common cortical sensorimotor generators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The evidence that these generators can be influenced by afferent input provides important information regarding the functional mechanisms involved in modulating cortical excitability in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we suggest that peripheral electrical stimulation can be used as an additional activation test in this kind of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
