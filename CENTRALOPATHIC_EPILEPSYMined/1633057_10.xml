<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess the clinical applicability of dipole tracing in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, the location and stability of electric source generator of focal spikes seen in EEG of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> children were investigated using this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 3 groups; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BCECS, Group A, n = 14), other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centrotemporal spikes (Group B, n = 15) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with focal spikes in other areas (Group C, n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spike dipole in each group was analyzed using dipole tracing method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following results were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(1) The spikes of BCECS were characterized by constantly stable dipoles, compared to those of the other types of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spikes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> mostly lacked the stability of dipoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These seemed to suggest that the stability of dipoles was closely related to the prognosis and pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) The dipoles of BCECS were localized strictly in the Rolandic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dipole tracing from EEG spikes was considered to contribute to the elucidation of the pathophysiology of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
