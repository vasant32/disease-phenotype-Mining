<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine reasons for neuroimaging and neuroimaging findings in children with benign focal epileptiform discharges (BFEDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of children who had BFEDs on routine EEG and underwent brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 97 patients with BFEDs and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-five of these 97 patients also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270847" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">benign focal epilepsy of childhood</z:e> with centrotemporal spikes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rationale for imaging in the 45 BECTS patients included historical features such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> (14), increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency (5), and new events (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine MRIs were obtained prior to referral and 12 for unspecified reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI findings were not significantly different between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> and BFEDs patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourty-one patients (42%) had abnormal findings on MRI, including T2 hyperintensities (10), hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (6), malformation of cortical development (4), volume loss (5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> (4), and others (18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRIs are not routinely recommended in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> unless atypical features are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Atypical features which may prompt MRI include change in clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types or frequency, historical features such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, abnormal neurological exam, and atypical EEG features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>42% of our selected patients had intracranial abnormalities, most of which were of unclear clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Remote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and early lesions accounted for most MRI findings suggesting they may be related to BFEDs </plain></SENT>
