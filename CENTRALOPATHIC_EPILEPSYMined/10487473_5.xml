<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We thus decided to evaluate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002121'>absence seizures</z:hpo> (AS) and generalised 3 Hz SW in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> first referred since 1986 have been identified prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their medical and electroencephalograph (EEG) records were analysed retrospectively, in the search for AS and generalised SW discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over a period of 11 years, we found typical rolandic spikes in 66 newly referred patients; 64 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> typical for the condition (18 female, 46 male), two were asymptomatic and were not further analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had routine waking EEG recordings, and 49 children (76%) had at least one sleep EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AS or classical generalised 3 Hz SW were never recorded from history or EEG data, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, 17 patients had some diffuse SW discharges, lasting 1-5 s, which appeared as grossly symmetrical in only seven children, with a clearly asymmetrical aspect in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among these seven patients, the discharges were only seen on awakening in one, both during waking and nREM sleep stage I or II in one and only during nREM sleep stage I or II in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were apparently subclinical in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We thus found neither AS nor classical 3 Hz SW discharges among 64 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brief bursts of bilateral abnormalities occur in about 25% of the cases, mostly with sleepiness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such findings do not substantiate the existence of a continuum between CAE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
