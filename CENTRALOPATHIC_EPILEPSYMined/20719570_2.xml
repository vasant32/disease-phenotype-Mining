<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was based on a neuropsychological model of attention that assessed various components of attention in 21 children with BCECTS and 21 healthy children </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison with healthy participants, the children with BCECTS showed significant impairment in the measure of selectivity and in one measure of intensity of attention (arousal) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which the multicomponent model of attentional function has been used in children with BCECTS to provide a clearer neuropsychological profile of these patients </plain></SENT>
