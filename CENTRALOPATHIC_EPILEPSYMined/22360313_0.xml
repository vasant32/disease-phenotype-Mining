<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centrotemporal spikes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>), the most common childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndrome, is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> with a genetic influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its signature electroencephalographic pattern and distinct focal motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> semiology, little is known about the underlying brain anatomic alteration and the corresponding cognitive consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the motor manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, we hypothesize that anatomic networks in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> involve a distributed corticostriatal circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated volumetric differences and shape deformities of caudate, putamen, pallidum, and thalamus in a group of children with new- and recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> (N =â€ƒ 3) compared to healthy controls (N = 54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We correlated specific subcortical volumes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> that were significantly different from those in healthy controls with performances in executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> demonstrated significantly hypertrophied putamen, which was selective among the subcortical regions examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Shape analysis showed dorsoventral elongation of the left caudate and bilateral putamen, with subnuclei expansion in ventral and dorsal striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Larger putamen volumes were linked to better cognitive performances on two complementary executive function tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> showed aberrant volume and shape in subcortical regions that are critical for both motor processing and executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is of importance to note that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> appears to be cognitively adaptive, as enlargement was associated with improved cognitive performances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The anatomic abnormalities and their cognitive effects are evident in a group of children with new- and recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, suggesting that the structural brain anomalies occurred before the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
