<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a large sample of twins from four international twin registers to probe the genetics of BRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also aim to synthesize the apparently conflicting family and twin data into a model of BRE etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Large population-based twin registries of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsies</z:e> from Odense (Denmark), Richmond, Virginia (United States), and Oslo (Norway) were reviewed for BRE cases and added to our Australian twin data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of classic BRE was based on electroclinical criteria with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurologic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with a compatible electroclinical picture but abnormal neurologic development were termed non-classic BRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen twin pairs were identified (10 monozygous; eight dizygous) of whom at least one twin was diagnosed with classic BRE among a total sample of 1,952 twin pairs validated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were discordant for BRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The estimated monozygous pairwise concordance for BRE in this sample was 0.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.0-0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four twin pairs (one monozygous, three dizygous) had non-classic BRE, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> co-twins had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The twin data showing an absence of any concordant twin pairs with classic BRE suggest that noninherited factors are of major importance in BRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Modelling the data shows that the familial occurrence of centrotemporal spikes makes only a minor contribution to the familial aggregation of BRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genetic factors are probably more important in non-classic BRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The etiology and mode(s) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of BRE are much more complicated than initially conceptualized </plain></SENT>
