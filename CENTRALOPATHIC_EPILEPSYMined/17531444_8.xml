<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In a previous study we demonstrated children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign Rolandic Epilepsy</z:e> have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence and language ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, difficulties in verbal and visual memory and aspects of phonological awareness were found compared to normative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address the methodological limitations related to the use of normative data, we compared the same cohort of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign Rolandic Epilepsy</z:e> to a matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Controls (n=40) matched on age and gender to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign Rolandic Epilepsy</z:e> cohort underwent neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The life functioning of the control group was assessed using a modified version of the Quality of Life in Childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> Questionnaire (QOLCE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study confirmed the previous findings of memory and phonological awareness difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign Rolandic Epilepsy</z:e> had significantly lower IQ scores than the matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Paired sample t-tests showed that on 8 of 11 QOLCE scales, children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign Rolandic Epilepsy</z:e> were rated by parents as having poorer life functioning compared to matched controls, including lower parental ratings on the subscales of memory and language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign Rolandic Epilepsy</z:e> has an excellent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> prognosis, but this study further emphasizes potential cognitive difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using an age and gender matched control group, the previous findings of memory and phonological awareness difficulties were validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These problems in cognition were also identified by parents of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Benign Rolandic Epilepsy</z:e> as problematic and impacting upon the child's quality of life </plain></SENT>
