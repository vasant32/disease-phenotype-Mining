<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although some recent studies have reported various <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disorders</z:hpo> in children having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spike</z:e> (BCECT), it is still commonly believed that BCECT does not cause any definite neuropsychological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, reported impairments range over various cognitive functions, and there is no general agreement on this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed detailed neuropsychological tests in 17 children with BCECT and analyzed the profiles of their subtests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Atypical benign partial epilepsy</z:e> of childhood (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e>) is a type of BCECT in which patients have minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> and their EEGs show continuous spike-waves during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also performed the same tests in five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e>, and compared the results in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological tests performed are as follows: Kaufman assessment battery for children (K-ABC), Wechsler intelligence scales for children-revised (WISC-R), Illinois test of psycholinguistic abilities (ITPA), Benton visual retention test (BVRT), Token test, calculation, figure copying task, letter copying task, line bisection task, and line cancellation task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mental processing composite of the K-ABC and FIQ of the WISC-R were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with BCECT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e>, but were generally lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e> than in BCECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the profiles of subtests of ITPA in children with BCECT revealed the significant feature of the lower scores on verbal expression (p = 0.013) and auditory sequential memory (p = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considering the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scores in the elementary cognitive functions, such as visual and verbal functions and long-term memory, disturbance in the process of executive functions such as flexibility, fluency, and working memory could cause this characteristic profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e> also showed the similar profile in the subtests of ITPA to that of BCECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is likely that both groups of children share the common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
