<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and seventy-six patients with BRE were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had their first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> between the ages of 3 and 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>39.5% (109 cases) of patients ceased to have further BRE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> by the age of 6 years, 93.1% (257 cases) recovered by the age of 12 years and 96.7% (267 cases) recovered by the age of 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and twenty-seven patients suffered only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002349'>simple partial seizures</z:hpo>, whereas 49 patients suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EEG scans of 239 patients showed repetitive diphasic spikes or sharp waves with high amplitude, which were most dominant in the central or centrotemporal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The spikes were confined to one hemisphere in 180 patients and occurred bilaterally in 59 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs (AEDs): carbamazepine (CBZ) or valproate (VPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study showed that, in Chinese children, BRE is remarkably characteristic in its clinical and EEG presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although BRE is usually benign in terms of ease of control with AEDs and spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> remission, for those patients with a high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, AEDs should be prescribed positively </plain></SENT>
