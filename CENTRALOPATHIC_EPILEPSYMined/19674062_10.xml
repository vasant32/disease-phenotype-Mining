<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Evidence for a specific association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (RE) has been conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> frequently have electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities, including rolandic discharges, and approximately 50% of siblings of patients with RE exhibit rolandic discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> risk in RE probands and their siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used cohort and reconstructed cohort designs to respectively assess the relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> in 72 children with RE and their 88 siblings using International Classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Disorders (ICHD-2) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidences were compared in 150 age and geographically matched nonepilepsy probands and their 188 siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a Cox proportional hazards model, using age as the time base, adjusting hazard ratios (HRs) for sex in the proband analysis, and for sex and proband <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> status in the sibling analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> in RE probands was 15% versus 7% in nonepilepsy probands, and in siblings of RE probands prevalence was 14% versus 4% in nonepilepsy siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sex-adjusted HR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> for an RE proband was 2.46 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-5.70] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The adjusted HR of having &gt; or =1 sibling with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> in an RE family was 3.35 (95% CI 1.20-9.33), whereas the HR of any one sibling of a RE proband was 2.86 (95% CI 1.10-7.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>Migraine</z:hpo> is strongly comorbid in RE and independently clusters in their siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest shared susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and RE that is not directly mediated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility gene variants for RE may be tested as risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
