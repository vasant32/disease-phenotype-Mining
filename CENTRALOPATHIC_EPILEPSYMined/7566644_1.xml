<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to our expectations and the observations reported by Stodieck and Wieser (1987), we were not able to detect focal negative slow shifts preceding interictal discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Possible reasons for this result are as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cerebral event to which we triggered might have been too 'weak' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another problem is that not every single spike generated in the deep reaches the surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the moment, a spike occurs in the scalp-recordings does not necessarily represent the moment the brain changes from one state to another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reference electrode might also play a role in obscuring any slow shift </plain></SENT>
