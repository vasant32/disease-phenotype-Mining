<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using additional scalp coverage according to the 10-10 electrode system, we attempted to correlate 2 specific spike features: (a) dipole fields, and (b) exact location of maximum negativity, with the presence or absence of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in 42 neurodevelopmentally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children with rolandic (central) spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three (79%) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of 21 children revealing dipoles (81%) and 16 of 21 patients without dipoles (74%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children with high central (C3/C4) foci were just as likely to present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (10 of 15, 67%) as were those with low central (C5/C6) foci (23 of 27, 85%) (P &gt; 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of our study subjects (27 of 42, 64%) revealed maximum negativity in the low central region (C5/C6), and the dipole feature was as likely to be associated with high central foci (7 of 15, 47%) as with low central foci (14 of 27, 52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although rolandic spikes are a reliable indicator of potential epileptogenicity, neither their exact location nor dipolar distribution help to further define the population with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
