<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment attitudes remain a controversial issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examine features that could suggest refractoriness at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 144 children with BCECTS diagnosed at the Division of Pediatric Neurology, Asan Medical Center, from March 1, 1995, to April 30, 2002 and treated with AEDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were subdivided into two groups according to the number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs used for effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 144 patients, 75 were male and 69 were female, with a mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of 7.2 +/- 2.3 years (range, 2.1-14.3 years); 119 children were taking one <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug (AED) (Group A), and 25 were taking more than one (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant group differences in female-to-male ratio, prescribed AEDs, number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> before the start of treatment, interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and start of treatment, presence of secondarily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo>, or presence of bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The groups differed however, in mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (7.6 +/- 2.2 years versus 5.1 +/- 1.9 years, p &lt; 0.05) and percentage of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before 3 years (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When treated with AEDs, children with BCECTS usually respond well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, an earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> is associated with more frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and initial refractoriness to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
