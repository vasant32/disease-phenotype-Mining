<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As previous studies have investigated the cognitive development of mainly school-aged children, this study focuses on preschool and elementary school children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five children affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e>/rolandic discharges and 25 healthy children matched for age and sex were enrolled in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean IQ scores were 94.76 for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and 99.3 for control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, cognitive testing revealed increased verbal and nonverbal deficits with respect to articulation (P=0.002), auditory memory (P=0.003), visual memory (P=0.016), language comprehension (P=0.009), and visual-constructive performance (P=0.033), as compared with the children in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our sample, the results showed an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> and language and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As cognitive development in preschool children is progressive and dynamic, larger prospective follow-up studies, with assessments at different time points, will facilitate understanding of the cognitive profiles of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
