<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (BRE) is a benign condition, it may be associated with a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the cognitive and other neuropsychological profiles of children with BRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 23 children with BRE were consecutively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children underwent sleep electroencephalography (EEG) and were assessed on a battery of comprehensive neuropsychological tests including the Korean versions of the Wechsler intelligence scale for children III, frontal executive neuropsychological test, rey complex figure test, Wisconsin card sorting test, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit</z:hpo> diagnostic scale, and child behavior checklist scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study subjects included 13 boys and 10 girls aged 9.0±1.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our subjects showed an average monthly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency of 0.9±0.7, and a majority of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>focal seizures</z:hpo> (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The spike index (frequency/min) was 4.1±5.3 (right) and 13.1±15.9 (left) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 23 subjects, 9 showed frequent spikes (&gt;10/min) on the EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subjects had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive and frontal executive functions, memory, and other neuropsychological sub-domain scores, even though 8 children (35%) showed some evidence of learning difficulties, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficits</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data have limited predictive value; however, these data demonstrate that although BRE appears to be benign at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, children with BRE might develop cognitive, behavioral, and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> during the active phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and these problems may even outlast the BRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we recommend scrupulous follow-up for children with BRE </plain></SENT>
