<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six cases (21 males, 15 females; 8 months-14 years old), in which awake and/or sleep EEGs revealed CTSD were included in this study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Typically isolated spike and slow-waves in T3/T4 and C3/C4 location were significantly more common (86%) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> group (p = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The EEGs of cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> had more frequency in the cluster of discharges than the other groups (p = .018) </plain></SENT>
