<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The goal of this work was to study written language skills in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BCECTS) in the absence of atypical clinical or electroencephalographic (EEG) features (n = 32), as compared with controls (n = 36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BCECTS patients (7-16 years), attending regular school, without cognitive or behavioral regression, or atypical EEG patterns, completed four tests assessing written language skills and one nonverbal cognitive test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>School performance information was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> types, duration, and frequency; awake and sleep interictal EEG findings; and medication status were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> and educational outcome was recorded for a period of 1-5 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As a group, BCECTS patients performed significantly worse than controls in spelling, reading aloud, and reading comprehension; presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476254" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">dyslexic</z:e>-type errors; and frequently had below-average school performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 11 with poor written language performance, 4 had developmental dysfunctions before school and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and, as a group, demonstrated low performance on a nonverbal cognitive test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even though 65.6% were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> due to frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> while awake, none belonged to the atypical BCECTS spectrum with respect to clinical or EEG findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> duration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency were less represented in patients with no or mild written language problems than in those with poor performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, clinical course and EEG findings in this group were no different than those for the 11 children with severe written language problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up indicated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851265" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">learning problems</z:e> appear persistent and several children require remedial classes and/or tutoring after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> has resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Children with severe but not atypical BCECTS performed, as a group, significantly worse than controls in written language skills, specifically in spelling, reading, aloud and reading comprehension; they also presented many difficulties also found in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, poor written language performance was not considered specific to BCECTS because it occurred in children with generally low cognitive capacity and/or preexisting developmental dysfunctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a dissociation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> outcome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851265" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">learning problem</z:e> outcome, in the subgroup with poor performance, casts doubt on the existence of a possible causal link between BCECTS and educational performance </plain></SENT>
