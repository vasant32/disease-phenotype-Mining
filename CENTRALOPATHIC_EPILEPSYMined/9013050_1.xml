<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This slowing appears especially when RDs are frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Holmes therefore hypothesized that these slow waves in BCECT were not the manifestations of structural lesion of the brain but secondary slowing accompanying RD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify the origin of the slow activity, clonazepam was administered to four BCECT patients who had the focal slow waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonazepam has recently been found by us to selectively diminish RD in BCECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the administration of clonazepam for 4 consecutive weeks, not only RDs but also the slow activity disappeared completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding strongly suggests that these focal rhythmic slow waves in the same region of the RD are a part of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of RD </plain></SENT>
