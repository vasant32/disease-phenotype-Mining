<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The time of day during which the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> appeared and the paroxysmal activity densities during non-REM and REM sleep are not distributed differently among the 3 electro-clinical types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centro-temporal spikes group had more patients with sleep-sensitive paroxysmal activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who mainly had nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were found to have more frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> and a greater sleep-sensitive paroxysmal activity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients who had little or no paroxysmal activity during sleep were the youngest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study illustrates that sleep-sensitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and paroxysmal activities are not specific to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes</z:e>, and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and paroxysmal activities are two manifestations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, affected in different ways by states of vigilance </plain></SENT>
