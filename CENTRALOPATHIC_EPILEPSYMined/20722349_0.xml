<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults there is a higher percentage of lateralized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> discharges in the left cerebral hemisphere; however, in children this pattern does not seem to have the same distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the lateralization of interictal spikes in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> in relation to the sex of the child and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of 114 children with a clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> according to ILAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results obtained from two EEGs, performed at intervals of 6 and 12 months, were correlated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and the sex of the child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and the age of the child (p=0.461) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we analyzed the relationship between laterality and sex we did not observe any difference in the first EEG (p = 0.767) results; however, in the results of the second EEG there was a difference (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In males, left and bilateral interictal spikes were predominant, and in females the right hemisphere showed predominant spikes and there were continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow sleep (CSWSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The analysis between laterality and a child's age did not show predominant interictal spikes in the hemispheres, except in males where there were predominant multifocal and generalized spikes, but not lateralization (p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The conclusion was that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> the lateralization of interictal spikes was not consistent as described in adult patients, but there was a slight left hemispheric predominance in boys and right hemispheric predominance in girls </plain></SENT>
