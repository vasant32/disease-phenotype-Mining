<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The physiological roles of SRPX2 remain unknown to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One way to infer the function of SRPX2 relies on the identification of the as yet unknown SRPX2 protein partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of interactome approaches including yeast two-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cell surface binding and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we show that SRPX2 is a ligand for uPAR, the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that uPAR(-/-) knock-out mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and had brain cortical anomalies consistent with altered neuronal migration and maturation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> features that are reminiscent to the phenotypes caused by SRPX2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPR analysis indicated that the p.Y72S mutation associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> and perisylvian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002126'>polymicrogyria</z:hpo>, led to a 5.8-fold gain-of-affinity of SRPX2 with uPAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>uPAR is a crucial component of the extracellular plasminogen proteolysis system; two more SRPX2 partners identified here, the cysteine protease cathepsin B (CTSB) and the metalloproteinase ADAMTS4, are also components of the extracellular proteolysis machinery and CTSB is a well-known activator of uPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The identification of functionally related SRPX2 partners provides the first and exciting insights into the possible role of SRPX2 in the brain, and suggests that a network of SRPX2-interacting proteins classically involved in the proteolytic remodeling of the extracellular matrix and including uPAR participates in the functioning, in the development and in disorders of the speech cortex </plain></SENT>
