<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve children were treated with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug (carbamazepine, valproate, or sulthiame) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group of 24 children (14 females; age range 8y 2mo to 14y 5mo, mean 11y, SD 1y 8mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The test battery included tests for facial expressions, lip and tongue movements, repeated syllables, and articulation using nonsense and tongue-twisting words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensibility on tongue and lips was tested with two-point discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As language tests, Rapid Confrontation Naming, orthographic, and phonologic decoding tests were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A dichotic listening test was performed in 13 children with RE and in 14 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to control children, those with RE had significantly greater problems concerning tongue movements (p &lt; 0.05) and articulation (nonsense words and tongue-twisting words; p &lt; 0.01), and worse performance on dichotic listening (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="39" ids="29287">Oro</z:chebi>-lingual sensibility and results of language tests did not differ between those with RE and control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that children with RE have distinct but mild problems with oromotor performance and auditory discrimination </plain></SENT>
