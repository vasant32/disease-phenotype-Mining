<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we addressed the question of whether the interictal spike structure is different between "typical" and "atypical" BREC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Atypical BREC patients are characterized by having other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo> in addition to the typical BREC symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This question is of interest given the good prognosis associated with the typical form of BREC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data from 12 typical and 12 atypical BREC patients using ten variables to describe spike <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and topography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The non-parametric method of "classification and regression trees" (CART) was used to detect discriminating features and construct a classification rule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this way the location and amplitude of the spike were found to provide satisfactory discrimination, suggesting that the two groups may be affected by different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study showed the effectiveness of the CART methodology in dealing with the categorical and non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variables that can be obtained from EEG records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It illustrates a simple but logical approach to the analysis of potentially complex topographic data </plain></SENT>
