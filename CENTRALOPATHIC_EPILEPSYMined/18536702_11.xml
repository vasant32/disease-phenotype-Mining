<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene (SLC12A6) is located on chromosome 15q14, a region that has previously shown linkage with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270850" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IGE|EIG">idiopathic generalized epilepsy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, recessively inherited mutations of SLC12A6 cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ACCPN">Andermann syndrome</z:e>, characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001274'>agenesis of the corpus callosum</z:hpo>, which is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have demonstrated the association of two G/A promoter polymorphisms of SLC12A6 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo> in a case-control study, and familial segregation of the rare variants as well as a trend toward association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate functional consequences of these polymorphisms, lymphocyte DNA was extracted, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> modified, and subsequently sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate SLC12A6 promoter activity, various promoter constructs were generated and analyzed by luciferase reporter gene assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that the G- allele showed a significant reduction of reporter gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In human lymphocytes, the allele harboring the rare upstream G nucleotide was found to be methylated at the adjacent C position, possibly accountable for tissue-specific reduction in gene expression in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate functionality of an SNP associated with psychiatric disease and our results may represent a functional link between genetic variation and an epigenetic modification </plain></SENT>
