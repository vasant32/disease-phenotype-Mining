<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While BRE and absence groups did not differ with regard to presence of psychopathology, IQ levels and types of psychopathologies, children with CSWS had more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> and lower IQ scores compared to the patient group with <z:mp ids='MP_0003216'>absence epilepsy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that CSWS and BRE are two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> syndromes that lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> and lower IQ scores </plain></SENT>
