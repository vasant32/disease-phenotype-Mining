<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>Dyslexia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029576" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">other developmental disorders</z:e> are associated with rolandic EEG traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim: To investigate if there is an association between the manifestation of a specific EEG trait of RE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If the EEG traits are causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> are supposed to be normalised after the EEG trait have resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirty adolescents and young adults, who had previously received a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> by standard criteria, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen probands (mean age = 15.9) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> and rolandic EEG traits were compared with 15 age- and sex-matched controls (mean age = 16.0) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between the groups according to intelligence (Verbal IQ, Performance IQ and Arithmetical IQ) or spelling ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant difference between the groups in reading ability of non-related words with the group without RE performing better than the group with RE (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Attentional shifts in dichotic listening with forced or directed attention are generally found in 50-60% in normative samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the present date suggest an impaired attentional shift in dichotic listening test for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one third was able to modulate their ear-preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no group differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In general, both dyslectic groups did not show significant neuropsychological deficits as compared to standard controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, there were more reading errors and a tendency to attention impairments in the group with rolandic EEG trait as compared to the dyslectic group with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Possible pathogenic factors are discussed </plain></SENT>
