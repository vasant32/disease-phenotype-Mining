<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dichotic listening results revealed two indices of immature functional asymmetry when the focus was left-sided (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>-L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>-L did not show left hemisphere dominance for the processing of place of articulation, which was recorded in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>-R and control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, healthy children exhibited a gradual increase in left hemisphere dominance for place processing during childhood, which is consistent with the shift from global to finer-grained acoustic analysis predicted by the Developmental Weighting Shift model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>-L showed atypical left hemisphere involvement in the processing of the voiced value (+V), associated with a long acoustic event in French stop consonants, whereas right hemisphere dominance increased with age for +V processing in healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>-L, therefore, interferes with the development of left hemisphere dominance for specific phonological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
