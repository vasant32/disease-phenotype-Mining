<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Event-related analyses of functional MRI (fMRI) typically assume that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and offset of neuronal activity match stimuli <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and offset, and that evoked fMRI signal changes follow the canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some event types, however, may be unsuited to this approach: brief stimuli might elicit an extended neuronal response; anticipatory effects might result in activity preceding the event; or altered neurovascular coupling may result in a non-canonical HRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An example is interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), which may show a non-canonical HRF and fMRI signal changes preceding their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> as detected on EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In such cases, less constrained analyses - capable of detecting early, non-canonical responses - may be necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A consequence of less constrained analyses, however, is that artefactual sources of signal change - motion or physiological noise for example - may also be detected and mixed with the neuronally-generated signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this paper, to address this issue, we describe an event-related independent components analysis (eICA) that identifies different sources of event-related signal change that can then be separately assessed to identify likely artefacts and separate primary from propagated activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also describe a group analysis that identifies eICA components that are spatially and temporally consistent across subjects and provides an objective approach for selecting group-specific components likely to be of neural origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We apply eICA to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> - with stereotypical IEDs arising from a focus in the rolandic fissure - and demonstrate that a single event-related component, concordant with this source location, is detected </plain></SENT>
