<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent reports indicate the presence of neuropsychological problems in a significant percentage of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study was aimed to examine the educational performance and neuropsychological functions along with clinical and electrographic characteristics in a cohort of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified a cohort of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> by screening medical and EEG recordings of patients attending our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were collected with a standard protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their educational performance was evaluated by an interview with the parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological and language tests were administered to children who had educational problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was done using the chi2-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty children (29 boys and 21 girls; mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> 7.84+/-2.87 years) who met the criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> characteristics for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> were observed in 26 (52%) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EEG showed typical centrotemporal spike and wave discharges in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children, 42% of them had a tangential dipole in the frontocentral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An additional extra-rolandic focus in the EEG was found in seven children (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Educational problems were identified in 27 children (54%); 19 of them had neuropsychological or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo> (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We found a statistically significant correlation between the occurrence of educational problems and the absence of a tangential dipole in the EEG (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Abnormal language function had a significant correlation with atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> semiology (p=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that a significant number of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> have neuropsychological impairment and educational problems </plain></SENT>
