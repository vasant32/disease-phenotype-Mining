<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To preserve temporal information, short (200 msec.) overlapping windows were used during computation, covering the initial fast and later slow components of the spike </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several unique topographic patterns of electrical interdependence were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes in association patterns between different scalp regions during the evolution of these spike discharges may shed light on the cortical activation involved </plain></SENT>
