<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In thirteen children the condition was idiopathic and nine of them had a positive family history; the remaining one had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs was good in 60% of the treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six children had paroxysmal non-kinesigenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100660'>dyskinesia</z:hpo>, with a mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of 8.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five children were symptomatic because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> (two patients), basal ganglia <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (one patient), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (one patient); the remaining patient's condition was familial with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response to medical treatment was unsuccessful contrasting with paroxysmal kinesigenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100660'>dyskinesia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although there have been great advances in the genetics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007166'>paroxysmal dyskinesias</z:hpo> in which an ion channel dysfunction has been hypothesized, the diagnosis is still based on clinical grounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The precise classification of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007166'>paroxysmal dyskinesias</z:hpo> is important for therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
