<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases were ascertained through review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EEG records, and diagnosis was verified by review of medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up information regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and treatment was obtained from parents and treating physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the Icelandic population aged 3-15 years, the incidence of BRS is 6.2 and BRE 4.7 in 100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 95% were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free and had not been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs (AEDs) for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that BRS is a common entity in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prognosis is excellent and treatment is not necessary in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is important to identify BRE/BRS correctly and distinguish it from other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
