<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To stress that different atypical evolutions occur in the course of disease in some patients with the so called benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsies</z:e> of childhood (BPEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To promote interest in finding clinical and/or electroencephalographic clues to recognize which patients might be prone to present these risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Follow up of 26 pediatric patients who started with typical clinical and EEG features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes</z:e> (BCECTS) but presented reversible or persistent serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> events including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> and language, cognitive or behavioral impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeated neurological examinations, EEG records and neuropsychological evaluations were done in the course of up to 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain imaging studies (CAT and/or MRI) were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four groups of patients were recognized: 11 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atypical benign partial epilepsy</z:e> of childhood (ABPEC) followed during 4 to 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> have finally recovered and attend <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> schools, although five have learning difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients met diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282512" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="LKS">Landau-Kleffner syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of them recovered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and in one, some language difficulties persist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven children showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> of BCECTS but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them are now <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after 3 to 14 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five children showed mixed features of the three groups mentioned above and three of them fulfilled the criteria for diagnosis of the syndrome of continuous spike-wave during slow sleep (CSWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A small proportion of cases starting with BCECTS evolve into either ABPEC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e>, status of BCECTS or the syndrome of CSWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Then, BCECTS is not always benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical and EEG markers should be sought to predict these atypical evolutions </plain></SENT>
