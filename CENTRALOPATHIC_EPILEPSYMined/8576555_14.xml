<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective case series design was employed in the setting of a tertiary care pediatric hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> were seen through our neurology department between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their charts were reviewed for atypical clinical features, imaging studies and results, total number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> at initial presentation and last follow-up, and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atypical clinical features included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, daytime-only <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, screaming as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> component, and postictal Todd's <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children had at least one electroencephalogram, and these records were reviewed for atypical electrographic features such as unusual location, atypical spike <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and abnormal background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atypical clinical features were seen in 50% of patients and atypical electrographic features in 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic scans were performed in 15 patients and were consistently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> medication was initiated in 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although patients with atypical features did not have an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency, they were more likely to undergo imaging studies (P &lt; .01) and to be commenced on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> medication (P &lt; .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that atypical clinical and electrographic features are the rule rather than the exception in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further work must be done to develop a reliable definition of this common entity </plain></SENT>
