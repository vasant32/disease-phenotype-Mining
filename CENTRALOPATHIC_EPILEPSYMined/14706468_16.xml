<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some, for unknown reasons, ENM can be worsened by carbamazepine (CBZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe two children aged 11 and 15 years, in whom CBZ precipitated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> worsening and ENM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the morphological and topographic features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> while on CBZ and after CBZ withdrawal and compared them with those from 9 children with classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to identify possible electrophysiological specificities in patients who eventually develop ENM during CBZ treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The characterization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo>, related (R) and unrelated to ENM (U), in patients with ENM and rolandic discharges (RD) and in matched controls with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> was performed based on polygraphic digital EEG recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Off-line time-domain analysis included correlation coefficient between EEG and EMG channels, quantitative analysis on ENM, and topographic analysis on spike-and-wave complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Z-score test and paired t test were used when appropriate for statistical analysis on R, U and RD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recordings in both children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> and ENM while on CBZ showed frequent R discharges (mean interval between R=19.89+/-9.4 s in patient 1; 2.16+/-1.2 s in patient 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Withdrawal of CBZ produced abatement of R (no R recorded in patient 1; 5.69+/-7.1 s in patient 2) and reduction of the slow wave component of R (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp> and topography of R and RD differed in field distribution, amplitude (P&lt;0.01) and duration (P&lt;0.01) of the slow wave component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RD and U did not show a significantly different <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and field distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that an increased cortical inhibition could be the electrophysiological correlate of CBZ-induced ENM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If confirmed on a larger series, the presence of spike-wave (rather than sharp waves) discharges in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> might be used as an electrophysiological predictor of an abnormal response to CBZ </plain></SENT>
