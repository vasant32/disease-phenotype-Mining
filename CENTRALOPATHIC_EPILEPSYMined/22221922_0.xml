<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Owing to the age peculiarity of children who suffer from this disease, i.e., school-going age of between 6 and 9 years, the condition is often referred to as a school disorder by parents and teachers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the academic performance of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, according to the clinical and electroencephalographic ILAE criteria, and compare the results of neuropsychological tests of language and attention to the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The performances of 40 school children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> were evaluated by applying a school performance test (SBT), neuropsychological tests (WISC and Trail-Making), and language tests (Illinois Test Psycholinguistic Abilities-ITPA--and Staggered Spondaic Word-SSW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same tests were applied in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, when compared to those in the control group, showed lower scores in academic performance (SPT), digits and similarities subtests of WISC, auditory processing subtest of SSW, and ITPA--representational and automatic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> discharges did not influence the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> scored significantly lower scores in tests on academic performance, when compared with those in the control group probably due to executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
