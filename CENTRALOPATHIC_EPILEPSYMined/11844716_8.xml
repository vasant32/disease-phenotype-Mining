<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, neuropsychological deficits have been reported during its active phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluate the long-term neuropsychological consequences of this reputedly benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, particularly the relation between paroxysmal abnormalities and cerebral language lateralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological outcomes concerning both overall cognitive and lateral hemispheric functions were studied in twenty-three adolescents and young adults in total recovery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, in thirty-three controls without any significant past neurological history and in ten adolescents and young adults with complete resolution of generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0391957" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">idiopathic epilepsy</z:e> (childhood <z:mp ids='MP_0003216'>absence epilepsy</z:mp> or CAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Language lateralization was evaluated using classical neuropsychological procedures (dichotic listening tasks, dual-task procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was seen in the three populations with respect to overall cognitive function: memory, language and the executive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the Performance IQ was lower in patients in remission from CAE, the results were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, qualitative analysis of the dual-task procedure suggested a different organizational pattern for cerebral language in adolescents and young adults in remission from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> as compared to controls and patients in remission from CAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The different organization in cerebral pattern in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> patients appeared to be related to the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> focus as determined by the EEG and/or the sleep-recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We discuss the relationship between the presence of paroxysmal anomalies in childhood and subtle functional lateralized hemispheric abnormalities in adulthood </plain></SENT>
