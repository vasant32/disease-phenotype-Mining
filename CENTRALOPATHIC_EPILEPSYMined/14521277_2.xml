<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the rolandic area generating spikes is hyperexcitable, and that rolandic spikes propagate across the central area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the pattern of rolandic spike propagation and how the dipolar distribution of the spikes is related to the propagation pattern have not yet been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine EEGs from 27 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (BRE) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequential topographic mapping in 4-ms steps was used to analyze the pattern of spike propagation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The locations of maximum negative foci, the presence and distribution of the dipolar field, and the propagation pattern were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dipoles were present in 23 (85.2%) out of 27 patients and in 43 (72.9%) out of 59 foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two foci (54.2%) in 20 patients demonstrated a propagation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The typical pattern consisted of propagation from central to mid-temporal locations across the central sulcus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most spike foci exhibiting a propagation pattern had a dipolar distribution (87.5%; p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rolandic spikes originate from sulcal or gyral cortices on either side of the central sulcus, and that spike propagation can ensue by intracortical spreading across the central sulcus </plain></SENT>
