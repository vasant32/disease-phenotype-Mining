<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This impairment could be correlated with the amount of nocturnal epileptiform activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 26 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> and/or rolandic spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had undergone a 24-hour EEG and neuropsychological assessment within 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reading performance (reading words and sentences) and intelligence were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant negative correlation between amount of nocturnal epileptiform activity and reading sentences R=-0.525 (P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a trend in this correlation for reading words R=-0.398 (P=0.054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a negative correlation between amount of nocturnal epileptiform activity and Verbal IQ (R=-0.51 P=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between reading performance or Verbal IQ and amount of diurnal epileptiform activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reading performance is impaired in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> and is correlated with the amount of nocturnal epileptiform activity </plain></SENT>
