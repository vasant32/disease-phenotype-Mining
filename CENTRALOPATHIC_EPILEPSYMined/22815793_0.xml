<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>Reading disability</z:hpo> (RD) is a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> with genetic basis established in families segregating "pure" <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RD commonly occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic Epilepsy</z:e> (RE), a complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed genomewide linkage analysis of RD in RE families, testing the hypotheses that RD in RE families is genetically heterogenenous to pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo>, and shares genetic influences with other sub-phenotypes of RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We initially performed genome-wide linkage analysis using 1000 STR markers in 38 US families ascertained through a RE proband; most of these families were multiplex for RD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the data by two-point and multipoint parametric LOD score methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then confirmed the linkage evidence in a second US dataset of 20 RE families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also resequenced the SEMA3C gene at the 7q21 linkage locus in members of one multiplex RE/RD pedigree and the DISC1 gene in affected pedigrees at the 1q42 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the discovery dataset there was suggestive evidence of linkage for RD to chromosome 7q21 (two-point LOD score 3.05, multipoint LOD 3.08) and at 1q42 (two-point LOD 2.87, multipoint LOD 3.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Much of the linkage evidence at 7q21 derived from families of French-Canadian origin, whereas the linkage evidence at 1q42 was well distributed across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was little evidence for linkage at known <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combining the discovery and confirmation datasets increased the evidence at 1q42 (two-point LOD = 3.49, multipoint HLOD = 4.70), but decreased evidence at 7q21 (two-point LOD = 2.28, multipoint HLOD  = 1.81), possibly because the replication sample did not have French Canadian representation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>Reading disability</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> has a genetic basis and may be influenced by loci at 1q42 and, in some populations, at 7q21; there is little evidence of a role for known DYX loci discovered in "pure" <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>1q42 and 7q21 are candidate novel <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> loci </plain></SENT>
