<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centrotemporal spikes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>) is associated with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to clarify whether children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> with left- or right-hemispheric, or bilateral focus have specific neuropsychological language deficits when compared to healthy controls, whether these deficits correlate functionally with language network organization (typical vs. atypical), and whether cofactors such as duration, handedness, and medication have a relevant impact on language reorganization processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven patients and 19 healthy controls were examined with several neuropsychological tests (German version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children [WISC-IV], Regensburger verbal fluency test [RWT], Corsiblock forward and backward and Hand-Dominanz-Test [HDT]) and with two language paradigms on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): silent reading of word-pairs and silent generation of simple sentences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Although neuropsychological test results only differed by trend between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> patients and controls, language laterality indices (LIs) in fMRI were significantly lower in patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, the anterior language network with Broca's area and the supplementary motor area (SMA) revealed the lowest LIs and showed the most bilateral or right hemispheric activations in the sentence generation task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medication and duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> did not have any significant effect on language reorganization and patients' performances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Language reorganization in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> patients takes place in bilateral or right hemispheric language networks, with a strong focus in anterior language regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These functional changes can be interpreted as important compensatory strategies of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) to stabilize cognitive, especially language performance </plain></SENT>
