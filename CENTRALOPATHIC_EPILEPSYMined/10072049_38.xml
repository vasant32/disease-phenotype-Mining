<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a pedigree in which 3 members in the same generation are affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (RE), paroxysmal exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> (PED), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002356'>writer's cramp</z:hpo> (WC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002268'>paroxysmal dystonia</z:hpo> had a strong age-related expression that peaked during childhood, whereas the WC, also appearing in childhood, has been stable since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide linkage analysis performed under the assumption of recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> identified a common homozygous haplotype in a critical region spanning 6 cM between markers D16S3133 and D16S3131 on chromosome 16, cosegregating with the affected phenotype and producing a multipoint LOD score value of 3.68 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although its features are unique, this syndrome presents striking analogies with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> infantile <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> and paroxysmal coreoathetosis (ICCA) syndrome, linked to a 10 cM region between D16S401 and D16S517, which entirely includes the 6 cM of the RE-PED-WC critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same gene may be responsible for both RE-PED-WC and ICCA, with specific mutations explaining each of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Mendelian disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This report shows that idiopathic focal disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo>, can be caused by the same genetic abnormality, may have a transient expression, and may be inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> trait </plain></SENT>
