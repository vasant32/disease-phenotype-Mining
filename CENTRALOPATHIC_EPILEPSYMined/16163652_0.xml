<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It usually has a favourable prognosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> disappear during the teenage years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe a sample of children diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> in clinical, electrophysiological and imaging terms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also intend to compare the results obtained with those described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study of the children diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> who had been submitted to a follow-up at the Neuropaediatrics Unit at the HGSA since 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children who were less than 2 years old when they suffered their first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or who had abnormal neurological/imaging examinations were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two groups were defined (typical and atypical), several variables were characterised and these were then analysed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 87 children (51 males) were included in this study, their mean age being 13.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The population was divided into two groups: A (typical cases; n = 69) and B (atypical cases; n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was 6.2 and 6 years for groups A and B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The predominant type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was simple partial for group A and complex partial for group B; they were mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and nocturnal in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Medication was administered to 51 (73.9%) of the children in group A, with a good response in 78.4% of them; 13 members of group B (72.2%) received medication, with a positive response in 76.9% of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> has a broad clinical spectrum and usually courses with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> psychomotor development, but may coexist with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751265" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">learning disabilities</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this study, no significant differences were found between the typical and atypical forms of presentation, as far as their progress and response to treatment are concerned </plain></SENT>
