<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one children (11 males, 10 females), aged between 5 and 13 years (mean 10.5 years), and 18 (10 M, 8 F), aged between 3.3 and 14 years (mean 8.4 years), were randomised to receive monotherapy with levetiracetam or oxcarbazepine, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LEV was titrated up to 20-30 mg/kg/once or twice a day, and OXC up to 20-35 mg/kg once or twice a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine consecutive children (21 males, 18 females), aged between 3.3 and 14 years (mean 10.7 years), were recruited into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one were randomised on LEV (11 male, 10 female; mean age 10.5 years), and 18 on OXC (10 male, 8 female; mean age 8.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up period of 18.5 months (range 12-24 months), 19 out of 21 patients (90.5%) on levetiracetam, and 13 out of 18 (72,22%) on oxcarbazepine did not have further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean serum level of LEV was 4.1 microg/ml (range 1.3-9.0), and of OXC was 15.2 microg/ml (range 4.2-27.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse side effects on LEV were reported in 3 children (14.3%), represented by mild and transient decreased appetite (2) and cephalalgia (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were reported on OXC in 2/18 (11.1%), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (1), and sedation (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These preliminary data from an open, parallel group study suggest that levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine may be potentially effective and well tolerated drugs for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> who require treatment </plain></SENT>
