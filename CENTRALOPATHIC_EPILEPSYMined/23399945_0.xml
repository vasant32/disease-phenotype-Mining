<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The child underwent the following procedures at the ages of 8.2, 8.6, and 9.3years: 3D source EEG imaging, language fMRI (sentence generation and reading), and neuropsychological testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had a follow-up testing at the age of 10.8years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, 24-h EEGs were regularly performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the age of around 8years, the child was diagnosed initially with left-hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, which evolved to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e> with continuous bilateral discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 3D source imaging data revealed a left anterior temporal focus with a spreading to the right parietal and left centro-parietal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient had verbal <z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosia</z:hpo> with poor verbal yet good performance indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed a left-hemispheric reading network but sentence generation was impossible to perform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After initiation of adequate treatment, continuous discharges disappeared, and only very rare left-hemispheric centro-temporal spikes remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Verbal IQ and performance IQ increased at the age of 8.6years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed, at this time, a right-hemispheric language activation pattern for sentence generation and reading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the ages of 9.3 and 10.8years, language tasks remained right-hemispheric and verbal IQ remained stable, but right-hemispheric non-verbal functions decreased due to possible crowding-out mechanisms </plain></SENT>
