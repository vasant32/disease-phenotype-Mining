<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four children without any indication of organic brain lesion were divided into a group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and a group without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was subdivided into "classical BECT" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270847" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">benign focal epilepsy of childhood</z:e> with centro-temporal spikes) and "non-classical BECT." Sequential mapping of the rolandic spikes revealed two different topographic patterns: a pattern of stationary potential fields and a pattern of non-stationary potential fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The topographic pattern of stationary potential fields was morphologically represented by a single spike-and-wave complex whereas that of non-stationary potential fields was morphologically represented by a "double" spike-and-wave complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the non-stationary topographic patterns represented by a "double" spike, one specific sequence of changes of potential fields was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This sequence started with a dipolar field, with the negative pole in the frontal region and the positive pole in the centro-temporal region, morphologically represented by the small first spike of the "double" spike-and-wave complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This dipolar field, changes to a unipolar or dipolar field, with a negative potential field in the centro-temporal region and, sometimes, a simultaneous positive potential field in the frontal region, morphologically represented by the prominent rolandic spike </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This characteristic pattern was found to be significantly related to classical BECT </plain></SENT>
