<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Panayiotopoulos syndrome is a relatively common condition with susceptibility to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> benign childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, which manifests primarily with autonomic and mainly emetic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It predominantly affects children of 3-6 years of age (13% of those with one or more non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002373'>febrile seizures</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EEG shows great variability, with occipital, extra-occipital spikes or brief generalised discharges alone or in combination; it may also be consistently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occipital spikes do not occur in one third of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the high prevalence of autonomic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo>, the prognosis of Panayiotopoulos syndrome is usually excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remission usually occurs within 1-2 years from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, one third have a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> but 5-10% may have more than 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or a more prolonged course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atypical evolutions with absences, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010819'>atonic seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>intellectual deterioration</z:hpo> are exceptional; only two cases have been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We present a girl who initially had a prolonged autonomic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> typical of Panayiotopoulos syndrome, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, with concurrent symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She then had an atypical evolution with atypical absences, absence <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010819'>atonic seizures</z:hpo> and mild impairment of scholastic performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The case emphasises the close links between Panayiotopoulos syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">Rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, both of which probably represent different clinical phenotypes of a maturational-related benign childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> susceptibility syndrome [published with videosequences] </plain></SENT>
