<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the changes of ERP-P300 following different dosages of topiramate (TPM) treatment in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in order to investigate the effect of different dosages of TPM on cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>) were first administered with TPM at a dosage of 2 mg/kg/d for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Afterwards they received another 6 months of TPM treatment at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ERP-P300 was tested before and after different dosages of TPM treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the latency and amplitude of ERP-P300 before and after 6 months low dosages of TPM treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the latency was more prolonged and the amplitude was reduced in the ERP-P300 testing after 6 months high dosage of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi> treatment (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The effect of TPM on cognitive function is related to its dosage in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
