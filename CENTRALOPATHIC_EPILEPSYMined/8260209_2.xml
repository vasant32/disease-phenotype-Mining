<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the origin of RD, the lower rolandic cortex was proposed by Lombroso, but recently the hippocampus was proposed by some reports, based on the character of RD or the pharmacological effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, MRI hippocampal volumetric measurements revealed the relationship between the hippocampal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and EEG foci in intractable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tle">temporal lobe epilepsy</z:e> (TLE) of adults, but there are a few reports of the hippocampal volumetric study in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this paper, we reported about MRI hippocampal volumetric measurements in BCECT and TLE of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The statistical examination was performed by t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI hippocampal volumetric measurements were performed in 27 cases with BCECT (6-19 years, 9.9 +/- 2.7 years, 11 males, 16 females), 22 cases with TLE (5-22 years, 12.9 +/- 5.5 years, 15 males, 7 females) and 17 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (6-15 years, 10.4 +/- 2.7 years, 10 males, 7 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age was not significantly different among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of TLE group was significantly longer than BCECT group, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was not significantly different between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hippocampal volume and the right-side minus left-side volume were not significantly different in 3 groups, but these values of TLE were more scattered than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no abnormal signal intensity in hippocampus on MRI, or no specific abnormality in the surrounding structures in 3 groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
