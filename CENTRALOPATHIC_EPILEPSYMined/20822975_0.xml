<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the electroclinical features and evolution of seven infants with benign infantile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">focal epilepsy</z:e> with midline spikes and waves during sleep (BIMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven patients were examined at our department between February 2003 and February 2009, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> between six and 13 months of age (mean, 10.2 months; median, 11 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with cryptogenic and symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">focal epilepsies</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sex, age, familial history, type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and AED treatment were noted and EEG monitoring, MRI and CT scanning, and developmental and psychomotor evolution were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients included five males and two females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> during wakefulness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients (29%) did not have a recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five (71%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (ranging between two and five) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of the seven patients (14%) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, staring was observed in six (86%), motion arrest in five (71%), stiffening in five (71%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> in three (42%), automatisms in one (14%) and lateralizing signs in four (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients (29%) had secondary generalisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The duration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> ranged between 30 seconds and five minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The interictal EEG recording during sleep showed low-voltage unilateral or bilateral spikes located in the central and vertex regions, followed by slow waves in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Outcome was excellent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We believe that BIMSE is a new syndrome rather than an early presentation of benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> of childhood with centrotemporal spikes, Panayiotopoulos syndrome, or a late presentation of benign focal infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
