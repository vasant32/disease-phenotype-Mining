<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 27 children who were newly diagnosed with ESES and treated with LEV between August 2009 and March 2011 and who were followed up for at least 6 months were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age of the 27 children ranged from 9 months to 9 years and 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Partial motion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were found in 81% of the children in the early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three children received LEV treatment after ESES was definitely diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 23 children, 19 were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndrome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age of the patients at the beginning of LEV treatment ranged from 1 year and 8 months to 11 years and 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The follow- up duration was 7 to 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effective rate of LEV for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control was 82% and for EEG recovery it was 78% (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other 4 children received LEV treatment before the occurrence of ESES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> control and EEG recovery were noted in two of the 4 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LEV treatment is efficacious, to some extent, for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control and EEG recovery in children with ESES </plain></SENT>
