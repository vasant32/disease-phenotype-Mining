<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Support for the use of the canonical HRF has come from large studies that contain mixed cohorts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndromes and discharge types, and has demonstrated plausible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> localisation results in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other studies, however, have reported that some patients show a BOLD response that differs markedly from a canonical HRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim in this study was to see if the BOLD response is well modelled by a canonical HRF in a homogeneous cohort of patients with benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centrotemporal spikes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>), an idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e> with stereotypical centrotemporal spikes on the EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied eight well-characterised and typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> patients and found that the shape of the average BOLD response was different to the canonical HRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a localisation analysis using the group-average response provided increased sensitivity and specificity compared to the canonical HRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the canonical HRF may not provide the best model for the BOLD response in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndromes or spike-types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In studies of homogeneous patient groups, therefore, localisation results may be improved by using a group-specific BOLD response </plain></SENT>
