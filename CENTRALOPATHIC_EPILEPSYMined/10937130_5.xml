<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some children have been reported to manifest occipital and rolandic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, as distinct events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the presence during the same <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> of rolandic and occipital symptoms is exceptional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a 7-year-old boy with BRE in whom we video-EEG recorded two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> at 4 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first episode was a classic rolandic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> during sleep, while the second was prolonged with initial rolandic and late occipital involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is possible that a rolandic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, in a child within the age range of both BRE and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> CEOP, could spread to selectively involve the occipital lobe, because there is susceptibility of cortical neurons of both areas to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> at this age in idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
