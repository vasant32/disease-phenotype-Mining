<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 27 children, from 7 to 11 years neurologically and intellectually <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> was studied and compared to a control group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were submitted to anamnesis, neurological examination, Raven test, digital electroencephalogram and quantitative eletroencephalogram analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a higher delta, theta, alpha and beta absolute power in most of the electrodes and of alpha and beta for some electrodes in the BCET group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative theta power was also higher for the BECT group in most of the electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that in BECT there are diffuse differences form age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children including a difference in relative spectrum of electrical cerebral activity and that this may be related to a functional immaturity </plain></SENT>
