<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a meta-analysis of studies on benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECT) to ascertain whether clinical characteristics and outcome can be stated unequivocally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the Index Medicus and Medline CD+, we identified 525 publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After applying the criteria of the International League against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> (ILAE) for BECT, 32 publications on 2,561 patients remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After correction for inclusion bias and multiple publications on the same patient groups, 13 cohorts, comprising a total of 794 patients, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aggregate proportional remission was 0.977; hence, no factors influencing outcome could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> ranged from 3 months to 14 years, age at last <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> ranged from 3 to 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Kurtzke survival analysis of proportions of children in remission by age was performed; at an older age, the proportion of patients in remission was 0.9997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Publications had highly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> methodologies and population characteristics; we conclude that current knowledge on BECT has been determined mainly by retrospective studies of biased cohorts, and that the uniformity per se of BECT as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> syndrome may be, at least in part, a result of selection bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that early prediction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome in a new patient with BECT can not be given with certainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective, population-based studies are needed to delineate the clinical and EEG characteristics of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
