<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal was to demonstrate decreased frequency of IEDs with exposure to K448 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four subjects were recruited and 4-hour awake EEG recordings performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IED frequency per minute was averaged over each of three epochs per hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean IED count per epoch, standard deviations, and variance were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only complete waking epochs were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two subjects demonstrated sufficient waking IEDs for statistical analysis, consisting of three epochs of K448-related effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant decreases in IEDs per minute (33.7, 50.6, and 33.9%) were demonstrated comparing baseline with exposure to K448, but not to control music (Beethoven's FÃ¼r Elise) </plain></SENT>
