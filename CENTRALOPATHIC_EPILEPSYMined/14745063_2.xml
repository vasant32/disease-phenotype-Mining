<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> while awake in pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0699724" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep epilepsies</z:e> in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From October 1, 1992, to October 31, 1996, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0699724" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep epilepsy</z:e> presenting at a participating center were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">frontal lobe epilepsy</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for at least 2 up to 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> while awake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors enrolled 161 patients (64% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age at the time of inclusion ranged from 11 to 83 years (mean 43.2, median 39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five percent presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic clonic seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both sleep <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> while awake were absent for 2 years after inclusion in the study in 78% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients presented a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> while awake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The estimated risk of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> while awake during 6 years of follow-up was 13% (95% CI 7 to 18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that episodes of sudden withdrawal of therapy and a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> at inclusion were associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> while awake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The estimated risk of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> while awake in patients with none of the above risk factors was 6.5% (95% CI 1.5 to 11.3%) during 6 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical picture of pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0699724" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep epilepsies</z:e> is characterized by a preponderance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic clonic seizures</z:hpo>, low <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency, and a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The risk of occurrence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> while awake is low, particularly among patients with rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and good compliance with the therapy </plain></SENT>
