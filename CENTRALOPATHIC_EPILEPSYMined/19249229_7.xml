<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess prospectively language and speech ability in children with benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e> with centro-temporal spikes (BCECTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate academic performance and social competencies both during the active disease and after remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Right-handed school children with typical BCECTS and a control group matched by age, sex, handedness and socioeconomic status were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The German version of WISC-R, the "TÃ¼binger Luria Christensen Neuropsychological Test Set for children" (TUKI), the "Verbal Learning Memory Test" (VLMT), the "Heidelberger Speech Development Test-second edition" (HSET), and the "Salzburger reading and writing test" (SLRT) were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Child Behavior Checklist (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e>) and a semi-structured interview were performed with the children's teachers to gain insight into school performance, behavioral and emotional problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the active phase, the patient group - despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> global intellectual abilities - showed few, but significant impairments both in expressive speech and in receptive and expressive vocabulary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant deficit in the ability to recognize and express interpersonal relations was also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients' teachers stated deficits concerning academic performance and complained about disturbing behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parents reported significantly more psycho-pathological features in the subscales "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>Aggressive Behavior</z:hpo>", "Attention Problems" and "Anxious/Depressed" of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were independent of medication and spike localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After complete recovery from BCECTS, these problems were not found any more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both deficits of speech-related abilities (in both expressive and receptive vocabulary) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disturbances</z:hpo> can be detected in children with typical BCECTS, but are no longer apparent after remission of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorder </plain></SENT>
