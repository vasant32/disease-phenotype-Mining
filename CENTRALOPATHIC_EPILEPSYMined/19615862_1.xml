<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured during a visual 1-backmatching task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A quantitative analysis technique to analyze the ERP data, without any 'a priori' decisions on 'peak' presence, amplitudes or latencies, is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 46 children were tested (6-16 years old): 21 children with well-controlled "benign" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, n=9, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270850" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IGE|EIG">idiopathic generalized epilepsy</z:e>, n=12) and a control group of 25 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral task performance and ERPs following both target and nontarget stimuli were compared across both study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences were found in the number of omission errors or commission errors or in the reaction times between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, ERPs following target stimuli showed significantly higher amplitude in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> group compared to the control group over frontal and central regions within the time window between 250 and 425 ms poststimulus, what coincides with the time window of target-nontarget stimulus discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our study shows that children with benign, well-controlled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> show a different cortical activation pattern during a visual working memory task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that they need more brain processing effort to achieve the same performance level as their age matched controls </plain></SENT>
