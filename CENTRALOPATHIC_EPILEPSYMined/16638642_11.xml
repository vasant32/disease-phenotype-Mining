<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> are of importance to compare incidence and prevalence rates, age distribution, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndromes and treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To perform an epidemiological study on children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in a Swedish county using current ILAE classifications and a recent proposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based study was performed using the hospital data register to select children aged 1 month to 16 years with the diagnosis '<z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp>' or '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>' recognized between January 1996 and December 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and five children met the study criteria on the prevalence day 31st December, 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total prevalence rate was 3.4/1,000 with a peak prevalence in the age group 8-11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence year 2000 was 40/100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional neuroimpairments were registered in 47.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A majority of the patients, 54.0%, had focal or focal plus secondarily <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A named syndrome could be diagnosed in 49.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common syndrome was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> occurring in 17.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Childhood <z:mp ids='MP_0003216'>absence epilepsy</z:mp> occurred in 5.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Different disorders associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were found in 31.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most common associated phenomenon was malformation of cortical development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">Antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug treatment was used in 81.0%, the most common first choice being valproate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and incidence rates in this strictly delineated study are lower than those found in other epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Together with many divergences between reported studies concerning frequencies of different items, the results apparently depend on design, e.g. differences in age groups included, inclusion criteria used, and general methodology </plain></SENT>
