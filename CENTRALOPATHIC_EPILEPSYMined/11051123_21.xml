<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulthiame (STM) as monotherapy in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> patients entered a 6-month double-blind trial and were randomized to receive either STM (5 mg/kg/day) or a placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had had two or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> during the 6 months preceding the trial and were aged 3-11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were recorded by parents in a diary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STM plasma levels and electroencephalograms (EEGs) were overseen by patient-blinded observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary effectiveness variable was the rate of treatment failure events (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="38866,42330">TFEs</z:chebi>) per group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="38866,42330">TFEs</z:chebi> consisted of a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> after a 7-day run-in period, intolerable adverse events (AEs), development of another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> syndrome, or termination of the trial by parents or patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five of the 31 STM-treated patients (81%) and 10 of the 35 placebo-treated patients (29%) completed the trial without any <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38866,42330">TFEs</z:chebi> (p = 0.00002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38866,42330">TFEs</z:chebi> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (n = 4 for the STM patients, n = 21 for the placebo group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Parents requested termination for two placebo-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients were terminated for administrative reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient was withdrawn for AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients displayed at least one specific focus in either the awake or asleep EEG initially, 11 STM-treated patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> awake EEG and 10 had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> asleep one after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: STM was remarkably effective in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients suffering from &gt; or = 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> during the past 6 months had a high risk of early recidivism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>STM was well tolerated and should be considered for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> who are in need of treatment </plain></SENT>
