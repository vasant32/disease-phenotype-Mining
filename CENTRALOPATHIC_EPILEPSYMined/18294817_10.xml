<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little and far from conclusive information is available on its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> impact on the organization of higher cognitive functions during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of interictal EEG discharges in the peri-sylvian regions on language lateralization in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four 7-12-year-old children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> were compared with a control group of 16 healthy children matched for age, gender and schooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric speech lateralization was determined with the vowel-consonant dichotic listening (DL) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DL data showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> children lacked the typical right ear/left hemisphere functional advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The side of the interictal spikes had no specific influence on DL performance, while a multifocal location of the discharges had a particularly significant effect on the laterality index, as shown by the complete loss of the right-ear advantage in favor of a symmetrical performance with the overall level of accuracy remaining constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between spike frequency and DL data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> coincides with an atypical performance in DL test with the loss of the usual right ear/left hemisphere advantage, suggesting that interictal activity may induce a reorganization of speech perception lateralization, with a bilateral representation of the phonological processing of auditory and verbal stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was particularly evident in the group with multifocal spikes, which may mean that a widespread hyperexcitability can affect the network underlying DL performance more severely </plain></SENT>
