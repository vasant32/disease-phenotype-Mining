<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation of spike amplitude or duration with spread to adjacent areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No other focal abnormalities, such as focal slowing, occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spike activity was pronounced during light sleep and was often associated with generalized spike-wave activity, and thus was a sign of functional disturbance rather than the sequelae of brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A review of the literature indicates that this pattern is helpful in differentiating this from focal abnormalities due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
