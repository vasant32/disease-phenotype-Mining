<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both CSWSS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e> can be associated with the electroencephalography pattern of electrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> during slow-wave sleep and are part of a clinical continuum that at its benign end also includes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (RE) with centrotemporal spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CSWSS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e> patients can also have behavioral manifestations that overlap the spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> disorders (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An impairment of brain development and/or maturation with complex interplay between genetic predisposition and nongenetic factors has been suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A role for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> has been proposed but the pathophysiology of CSWSS and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e> remains uncharacterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In recent years, the participation of rare genomic alterations in the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorders</z:e> has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The involvement of copy number variations (CNVs) in 61 CSWSS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e> patients was questioned using comparative genomic hybridization assays coupled with validation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Whereas the patients showed highly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in genomic architecture, several potentially pathogenic alterations were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A large number of these corresponded to genomic regions or genes (ATP13A4, CDH9, CDH13, CNTNAP2, CTNNA3, DIAPH3, GRIN2A, MDGA2, SHANK3) that have been either associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> for most of them, or involved in speech or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo>, or in RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Particularly, CNVs encoding cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> proteins (cadherins, protocadherins, contactins, catenins) were detected with high frequency (≈20% of the patients) and significant enrichment (cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>: p = 0.027; cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule binding: p = 9.27 × 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Overall our data bring the first insights into the possible molecular pathophysiology of CSWSS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overrepresentation of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> genes and the strong overlap with the genetic, genomic and molecular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> networks, provide an exciting and unifying view on the clinical links among CSWSS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LKS</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
