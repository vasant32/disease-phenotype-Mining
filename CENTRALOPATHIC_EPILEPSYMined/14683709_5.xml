<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recorded spontaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) and EEG signals and cortical somatosensory-evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) to electric stimulation of the median nerve in 9 children with BREC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interictal rolandic discharges (RDs) and SEFs were analyzed by equivalent current dipole (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>) modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the orientation and locations of corresponding <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECDs</z:mp>, we compared generators of RDs with primary (SI) and second somatosensory cortices (SII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that RDs and SII responses had similar <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> orientation on the magnetic field maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECDs</z:mp> of RDs were localized 15.3 +/- 1.9 and 12.2 +/- 2.8 mm anterior to SI and SII, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The spatial distance on average from the location of RDs to SII (21.9 +/- 1.6 mm) cortex was significantly shorter than to SI cortex (29.7 +/- 1.7 mm) (P&lt;0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the cortical generators for RDs in patients with BREC are localized in the precentral motor cortex, closer to hand SII than to SI cortex </plain></SENT>
