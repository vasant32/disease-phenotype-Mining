<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested that some children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> can suffer from deficits of memory, attention and learning ability and in auditory-verbal and performance sub-tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, alterations in the baseline brain electrical activity determined by using the quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the absolute and relative powers in the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands of the qEEG in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, and their relation to IQ measurements (WISC-III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six 8 to 11-year-old children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> were studied, paired with a control group of healthy children according to age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the absolute delta and theta powers were statistically greater in the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> than in the control group, at almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, a negative correlation (Pearson's correlation test) was observed at various electrodes between the absolute delta and theta powers and the performance IQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate a possible relationship between maturational disturbance in the brain electrical activity development and the tendency for inferior cognitive performance in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
