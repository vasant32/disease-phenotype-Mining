<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients with electroclinical patterns consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> exacerbation during oxacarbazepine (OXC) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two manifested atypical absences, neuropsychological disturbances, and generalized spike-and-wave discharges in their electroencephalograms (EEGs) that became continuous during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The third patient showed, during OXC therapy, more frequent partial motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> which ended with ictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and post-ictal obnubilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EEGs recorded during sleep showed discontinuous paroxysmal activity in the right centrotemporal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were reversed following discontinuation of the OXC therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although electroclinical findings were consistent with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> diagnosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had some atypical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our observations show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> patients, in particular those presenting with atypical findings, might be at risk for developing paradoxical reactions to OXC therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that OXC should be included in the list of drugs that may cause electroclinical deterioration in these patients </plain></SENT>
