<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We describe 2 girls, aged 19 years, who experienced a rolandic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> at ages 4 and 5, respectively, together with the interictal EEG features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (BRE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adolescence both patients developed photosensitive occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> accompanied by spontaneous and photic-induced occipital EEG paroxysms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have been following 33 patients with a history of BRE, between ages 12 and 28 years (mean 17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of these patients had experienced their last rolandic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> before the age of 10 years and 9 of them had been without treatment since age 11 or earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2 of these 9 patients, other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> recurred after remission of BRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical, EEG, and evoked potential findings on these 2 patients are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After having experienced BRE, both patients suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>partial seizures</z:hpo> from age 12, with elementary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002367'>visual hallucinations</z:hpo>, visual blurring, slow head turning, cephalic pain, epigastric discomfort, unresponsiveness, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was related to watching TV or exposure to bright light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EEG showed interictal occipital spikes, and a photoparoxysmal response limited to the occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visual evoked potentials were greatly increased in amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had two visual attacks only and remained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free after 4 years of follow-up, while the other had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> controlled by an association of valproate and carbamazepine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and neurophysiological characteristics suggest that these two patients may have presented different age-related expressions within the spectrum of a benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> susceptibility syndrome rather than sharply distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndromes </plain></SENT>
