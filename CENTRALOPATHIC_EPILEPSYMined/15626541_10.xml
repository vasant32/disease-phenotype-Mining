<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether stable dipoles, as seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, were also present in PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed dipole analysis of the interictal spike discharges seen in the interictal EEGs of eight children with PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We chose more than 10 spikes for each kind of spike, and investigated whether or not more than three of these spikes showed consistently stable dipole locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(1) We observed 15 different kinds of spikes in various regions in the EEGs of the eight children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) Twelve of the 15 kinds of spikes had dipoles with a high goodness of fit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 14 of the 15 spikes had stable dipoles with similar locations for more than three individual spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) Fourteen of the 15 spikes, including frontal spikes, showed dense dipole locations in the mesial occipital area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of these 14 spikes also showed other dipole locations in the rolandic area and/or the vertex (Cz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed that the various types of spikes observed in PS have similar and stable dipole locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The dipoles showing high stability, were located in the mesial occipital area, and were accompanied by dipoles located in the rolandic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The stability and location of these dipoles indicate that there may be a pathogenetic link between PS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
