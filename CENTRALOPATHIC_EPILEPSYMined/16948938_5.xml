<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their focus was the impact of paroxysmal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity on neuropsychologic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive longitudinal language assessment has not previously been undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a cross-sectional study, we demonstrated that some children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> have difficulties in verbal and visual memory and phonologic awareness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current study evaluated a subgroup longitudinally to determine if difficulties improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients underwent comprehensive longitudinal neuropsychologic and language assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical features evaluated included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency, absolute age, medications, and a follow-up EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in performance were analyzed using t-tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvement in cognitive functioning, particularly in the areas of verbal memory, receptive language ability, and phonemic manipulation, was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visual memory and aspects of phonologic awareness showed no change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improvements were not related to the clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is important to recognize cognitive difficulties in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Some difficulties can resolve; however, continued monitoring, particularly in areas of visual memory and phonologic awareness, is required </plain></SENT>
