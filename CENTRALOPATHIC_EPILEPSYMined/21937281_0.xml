<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An association between impaired school performance and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> is frequently reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Language outcome, in particular, seems to be affected, although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> originates from the motor-sensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we tried to find a correlation between locomotion problems and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this noncontrolled, open, clinical cohort study of 48 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e>, a 24-hour EEG and a neuropsychological assessment were obtained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> had a significant delay in reading skills (reading words: mean=6 months, SD=11.9, P&lt;0.002; reading sentences: mean=8.6 months, SD=12.7, P&lt;0.001), compared with the healthy population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between problems in motor development and delays in reading skills (reading words: r=-0.426, P=0.006; reading sentences: r=-0.343, P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reading performance is impaired in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reading of sentences is more impaired than reading of words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is a significant correlation between problems in motor development and language, suggesting their interaction at the level of the cortex </plain></SENT>
