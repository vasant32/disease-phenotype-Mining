<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have questioned the benign nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, as they have revealed neuropsychological deficits in many domains including language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> discharges during the night have long-term effects on auditory processing, as reflected on electrophysiological measures, during the day, which could underline the language deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to address these questions we recorded base line electroencephalograms (EEG), sleep EEG and auditory event related potentials in 12 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> and in age- and gender-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e>, 5 had unilateral and 3 had bilateral spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 5 patients with unilateral spikes present during sleep, an asymmetry of the auditory event related component (P85-120) was observed contralateral to the side of epileptiform activity compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> symmetrical vertex distribution that was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls and in 3 the children with bilateral spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the peak to peak amplitude of this event related potential component was statistically greater compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of subtraction waveforms (deviant - standard) revealed no evidence of a mismatch negativity component in any of the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that the abnormality of P85-120 and the absence of mismatch negativity during wake recordings in this group may arise in response to the long-term effects of spikes occurring during sleep, resulting in disruption of the evolution and maintenance of echoic memory traces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results may indicate that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BECTS</z:e> have abnormal processing of auditory information at a sensory level ipsilateral to the hemisphere evoking spikes during sleep </plain></SENT>
