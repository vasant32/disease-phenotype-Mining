<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We have studied the clinical differences between early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with centro-temporal spikes (early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> BECT) and Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS) to investigate the hypothesis that BECT and PS nosologically constitute age-dependent benign childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> susceptibility syndromes based on a common etiopathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 24 patients with BECT and 62 patients with PS, who satisfied the following definitions: 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> before 5 years of age; 2) the BECT and PS <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> started mainly with orofacial focal motor attacks and emetic symptoms followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>focal seizures</z:hpo>, respectively; 3) follow-up examinations for longer than 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the various clinical features between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In children with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> BECT, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> at times manifested with <z:mp ids='MP_0000622'>hypersalivation</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011153'>focal motor seizures</z:hpo>, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> that developed in the middle of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was different from the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> observed in patients with PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> recurred more frequently in patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> BECT, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> as well as prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was higher in those with PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients demonstrating below borderline IQ scores and mild developmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disorders</z:hpo> were more frequently seen in early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> BECT than PS, accounting for 37.5 and 14.6% (P&lt;0.05), and for 8% and 21%, respectively (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> BECT and PS have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> clinical characteristics, except for the same <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age, and appear to be nosologically different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The former seems to develop in combination with other acquired disturbances based on a BECT predisposition, while the latter develops based on a PS predisposition and involves a better prognosis </plain></SENT>
