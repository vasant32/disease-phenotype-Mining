<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A retrospective study was carried out on 53 cases with childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> to evaluate the validity of the initial selection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug (AED) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the AEDs selected at the beginning of the treatment from the medical records of 53 untreated cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A follow-up study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of the AEDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second study, we investigated the AEDs of 10 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atypical benign partial epilepsy</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e>), to clarify whether the initial AEDs selected for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> were related to the appearance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The AEDs used at the initial stage consisted of carbamazepine (CBZ), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> (VPA), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> (PB), and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B6</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main AEDs were CBZ and VPA for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localization-related epilepsy</z:e>, and VPA for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014548" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">generalized epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial selection of AEDs in 41 (85.4%) of 48 cases treated with AEDs were considered to be correct from the results of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We could not specify any AEDs that related to the appearance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ABPE</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The selection of AED in this series was considered to be most appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We proposed a criterion to determine whether to begin the AED treatment immediately at the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
