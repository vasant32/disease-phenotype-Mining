<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> (RE) experience difficulties with reading, language, and attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their siblings are at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> but are not otherwise known to have neurocognitive deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought evidence for an RE-associated neurocognitive endophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen probands (male-to-female ratio 9:4) and 11 epilepsy-free siblings (male-to-female ratio 5:6) completed a neurocognitive evaluation within the domains of reading, language, and attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of impairment were compared, and mean standardized scores of children with RE and their siblings were each compared against population means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Frequency of impairment in each domain was comparable for siblings and probands: 9% of siblings and 31% of probands were reading impaired; 36% of siblings and 54% of probands were language impaired; and 70% of siblings and 67% of probands had attention impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of differences between sample and population means revealed evidence of a similar pattern of language deficits in both groups, specifically for picture naming and attention to competing words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For measures of attention, both groups made significantly higher omission errors and were impaired in their ability to sustain attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Children with RE and unaffected siblings demonstrate neurocognitive impairments in the domains of language and attention that are likely to remain undetected with general clinical protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurocognitively impaired probands and siblings showed a remarkably similar profile of deficits in language and attention that could explain poor academic performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early evaluation and intervention may benefit these children academically </plain></SENT>
