<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To look for brain abnormalities by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes</z:e> (BCECTS), which is the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> syndrome in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen children, aged 6-12 years, with typical BCECTS were examined with MRI, six of them twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some hippocampal abnormality was found in six (33%) of the children, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with the syndrome's typical electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern ipsilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal size asymmetry was found in five (28%) children (right side &lt; left in two and left &lt; right in three), and high signal intensities on T2-weighted images were found in three (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two children also had other abnormalities; one had a heterotopic nodule near the contralateral frontal horn, and one had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold-Chiari malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hippocampal asymmetry remained unchanged in three of the children who were reexamined after 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High signal intensities on T2-weighted images were seen beneath the cortex-white matter junction in the frontal and temporal lobes of five (28%) children, one of whom also had a hippocampal asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRIs were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in eight (44%) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For the first time, hippocampal asymmetries and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white-matter abnormalities</z:hpo> have been detectable on the MRIs of children with typical BCECTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The etiology of the former is unclear, whereas the latter may be a result of a maturational delay involving a defective myelination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up studies are needed to evaluate the relation between these findings and the clinical course of BCECTS </plain></SENT>
