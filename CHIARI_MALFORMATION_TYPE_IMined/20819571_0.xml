<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In order to make posterior fossa decompression for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007099'>Chiari I malformation</z:hpo> simple and less invasive while using direct visualization, a novel solely endoscopic procedure has been employed for the decompression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to present neural endoscopic posterior fossa decompression and atlas laminectomy for Chiari type I patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one patients with Chiari type I underwent neural endoscopic posterior fossa decompression and atlas laminectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We described the procedure for neural endoscopic posterior fossa decompression and atlas laminectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in this series demonstrated cerebellar tonsil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> below the foramen magnum in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in the reviewed study underwent preoperative MRI as well as 3-month postoperative MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional follow-up MRI varied but was usually repeated 12 months to 18 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative MRI studies were retrospectively reviewed and compared with preoperative studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed clinical improvements, and none had any complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> had symptoms entirely disappear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (52.4%) experienced radiographic improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>decreased size</z:mp> or resolution) during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (42.8%) demonstrated decreased syrinx size and four (19%) demonstrated resolved syrinx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo>, 11 (73.3%) experienced symptomatic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median time to symptom improvement was four months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Post surgical MRI examinations indicated complete and sufficient decompression of foramen magnum region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscope atlanto-occipital decompression surgery is an innovative, safe and effective surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It has similar results compared to traditional surgery, however with the added advantages of being minimal invasive, having fewer complications, decreased influence on stability of occipital bony structure, and a faster recovery as well as reduced hospital stay and expenses </plain></SENT>
