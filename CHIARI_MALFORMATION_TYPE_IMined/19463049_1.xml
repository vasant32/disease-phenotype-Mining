<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goals in the present study were to authenticate the cranioencephalic disproportion in a group of patients with CMI and to discuss new developmental aspects according to which part of the occipital bone was underdeveloped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively examined a group of 17 patients with CMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements of osteotentorial and neural structures of the PCF were made on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with findings in 30 healthy controls by using the Mann-Whitney U-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dimensions of the neural structures did not differ between the 2 groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean length of the basiocciput was significantly shorter in the CMI group (19.4 mm) compared with the control group (25.7 mm; p = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean diameter of the foramen magnum was larger in the CMI group, but this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dimensions of the supraocciput and the mean angle of the cerebellar tentorium were identical in the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data in this study support the idea that occipital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> is the main cause of overcrowding within the PCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Basioccipital shortness is a cardinal feature of the resultant shallow PCF and could proceed from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorder</z:e> of the cephalic mesoderm of the parachordal plate or occur later in the infancy because of premature stenosis of the sphenooccipital synchondrosis </plain></SENT>
