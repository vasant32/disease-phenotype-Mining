<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients often present in middle age with incidental or minimally symptomatic CM-I, whose management is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One option is clinical and radiographic observation of asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors here present the case of a 36-year-old woman who had been monitored for 6 years for a minimally symptomatic CM-I and cervicothoracic syrinx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 5 years of follow-up, she suffered spontaneous rupture of a cerebral cavernous malformation when she was 27 weeks pregnant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ruptured cavernous malformation and <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> were operatively managed via a right frontal craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten months after the craniotomy for resection of the ruptured cavernous malformation, follow-up MRI demonstrated resolution of the CM-I and syrinx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Few similar cases have been reported in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case argues for the presence of dynamic factors in the development and maintenance of CM-I and supports the nonoperative treatment of asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
