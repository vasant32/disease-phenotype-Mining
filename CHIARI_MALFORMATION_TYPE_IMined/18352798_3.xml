<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Many authors have concluded that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) is due to a smaller than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> posterior cranial fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to establish this smaller geometry as the cause of hindbrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> in a family, the authors of this paper performed volumetric analysis in a family found to have this malformation documented in 4 generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Members from this family found to have a CM-I by imaging underwent volumetric analysis of their posterior cranial fossa using the Cavalieri method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No member of this family found to have CM-I on preoperative imaging had a posterior fossa that was significantly smaller than that of age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a CM-I will have a reduced posterior cranial fossa volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism for the development of hindbrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> in this cohort is unknown, this manifestation can be seen in multiple generations of a familial aggregation with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> posterior fossa capacity </plain></SENT>
