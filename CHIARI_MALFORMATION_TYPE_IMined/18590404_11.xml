<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Patients with hindbrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> or the so-called <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) and/or syringohydromyelia are treated with dorsal decompression alone; however, a small percentage of patients with other associated abnormalities require concomitant dorsal craniocervical junction (CCJ) fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors surveyed the indications for CCJ fusions in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of University of Iowa medical records and radiographs obtained between 1996 and 2005 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria encompassed patients with diagnoses of CM-I and/or syringohydromyelia requiring dorsal CCJ fusions, and others with CCJ abnormalities who had CM-I and/or syringohydromyelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-four patients were identified, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were symptomatic at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 2.5 to 86 years; 33% of the patients were &lt; 16 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized as follows, with some being assigned to &gt; 1 category: Group I, congenital or acquired CCJ abnormalities with reducible bone compression (25% of patients); Group II, previous anterior CCJ/upper brainstem decompression (44%); Group III, occipitocervical complex instability with CM-I and/or syringohydromyelia but without CCJ bone abnormalities requiring adjunctive posterior fossa decompression (26%); and Group IV, musculoligamentous instability, either from pathological states or from muscle dehiscence from repeated posterior fossa procedures (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instrumentation was used in 96% of patients, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 96% receiving semirigid fixation with <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> loop and sublaminar cables; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fusion constructs incorporated autologous bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up evaluation, fusion was radiographically complete in 97%, and symptom improvement was seen in 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dorsal CCJ fusions are required in patients with CM-I and/or syringohydromyelia who have concomitant CCJ abnormalities (Groups I and II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A definite group (CM-I and/or syringohydromyelia) without bone abnormality exists (Groups III and IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> secondary to a high syrinx </plain></SENT>
