<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of CMI remains unclear and is most likely multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A putative genetic contribution to CMI is suggested by familial aggregation and twin studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental models and human morphometric studies have suggested an underlying paraxial mesoderm insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a case-control association study of 303 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) across 58 candidate genes involved in early paraxial mesoderm development in a sample of 415 CMI patients and 524 sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of patients diagnosed with classical, small-PCF CMI by means of MRI-based PCF morphometry (n = 186), underwent additional analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genes selected are involved in signalling gradients occurring during segmental patterning of the occipital somites (FGF8, Wnt, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> pathways and from bone morphogenetic proteins or BMP, Notch, Cdx and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46904">Hox</z:chebi> pathways) or in placental <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, sclerotome development or CMI-associated syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Single-marker analysis identified nominal associations with 18 SNPs in 14 genes (CDX1, FLT1, RARG, NKD2, MSGN1, RBPJ1, FGFR1, RDH10, NOG, RARA, LFNG, KDR, ALDH1A2, BMPR1A) considering the whole CMI sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of these overcame corrections for multiple comparisons, in contrast with four SNPs in CDX1, FLT1 and ALDH1A2 in the classical CMI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple marker analysis identified a risk haplotype for classical CMI in ALDH1A2 and CDX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we analyzed the possible contributions of the most significantly associated SNPs to different PCF morphometric traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that common variants in genes involved in somitogenesis and fetal vascular development may confer susceptibility to CMI </plain></SENT>
