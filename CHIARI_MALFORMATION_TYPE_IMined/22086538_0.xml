<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Description of syrinx resolution after posterior fossa decompression (PFD) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I (CMI) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> (SM) has been rarely reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to investigate the outcome of PFD in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> secondary to CMI and to identify potential predictive factors for better outcome after PFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> secondary to CMI and SM, who had undergone PFD during the period 2000 through 2009, were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were (1) age ≤ 18 years, (2) diagnosis of SM associated with CMI, (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> as the first complaint, (4) having undergone preoperative and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with acquired CMI anomalies or who had received syringosubarachnoid shunting were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximal S/C ratio and syrinx length were measured to evaluate syrinx resolution after PFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 20% decrease in S/C ratio or length at the latest follow-up was defined as a significant radiographic improvement and complete resolution was used to describe the syrinx disappearing after PFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 44 patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI was conducted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 44 patients at 6 ± 3 months postoperatively, for 37 patients at 2 years ± 3 months, for 26 patients at 4��years ± 3 months, and for 15 patients at 6 years ± 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>97.7% (43 of 44) of patients showed significant radiographic improvement by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The distance of tonsillar descent (mm) was correlated significantly with the surgical outcome (r = 0.116, P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement was observed within 6 months postoperatively, with continued slow improvement after that </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Syringes showed significant improvement after PFD in most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> secondary to CMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Resolution generally occurred within 6 months follow-up and continued at a slow rate for several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, the severity of tonsillar descent is a potential predictor for better improvement after standard PFD </plain></SENT>
