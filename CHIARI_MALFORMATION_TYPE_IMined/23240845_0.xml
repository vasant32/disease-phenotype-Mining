<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> (SC) in children is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010536'>Central sleep apnea</z:hpo> (CSA) may subsequently occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, sleep studies performed in these patients have been focused mainly on assessing the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the incidence and management of CSA in these patients remains poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Authors of this study aimed to assess the efficacy of foramen magnum decompression (FMD) in resolving CSA, initially detected incidentally, in a small cohort of patients with CM-I and SC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data for 5 children who underwent FMD for CSA at Alder Hey Children's Hospital between December 2007 and December 2009 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were evaluated with respect to FMDs by utilizing pre- and postdecompression sleep studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 5 patients, 2 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> and 3 had Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient age at the time of surgery ranged from 1.1 to 12.6 years (median 4.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median postoperative follow-up was 3.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sleep studies revealed that 2 children experienced a &gt; 80% reduction in CSAs at 1.5 and 21 months after decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The remaining 3 children experienced a &gt; 60% reduction in CSAs when reevaluated between 2 and 10 months after decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>central apnea</z:hpo> index improved for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested that FMD is an effective treatment modality for improving CSA in patients with SC and associated CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The use of multimodal polysomnography technology may improve the evaluation and management of these patients </plain></SENT>
