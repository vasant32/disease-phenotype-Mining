<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN.: A retrospective imaging study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE.: To conduct an assessment of the correlation of the coronal asymmetries between tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp>, syrinx, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: A few reports have shown that the convex side of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> was on the same side as the dominant tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> or syrinx deviation in a majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, this issue remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS.: A retrospective study was conducted on young patients with a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002943'>thoracic scoliosis</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The curve direction, side of the dominant tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> and side of the syrinx deviation were recorded and assessed quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlations between the asymmetrically displaced tonsils, eccentrically located syrinx, and curve convexity were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS.: A total of 39 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concordance between the deviated side of the eccentrically located syrinx and dominant side of the asymmetrically displaced tonsils was 87.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 88.5% of the patients with an asymmetrically displaced tonsil, the convex side of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> was concordant with the dominant side of the tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp>, and in 86.2% of patients with an eccentrically located syrinx, the convex side of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> was on the same side as the deviated side of the syrinx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the dominant tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp>, syrinx deviation, and curve direction were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> on the same side in 82.6% patients with asymmetrically displaced tonsils and eccentrically located syrinx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION.: Asymmetrically displaced tonsils and eccentrically located syrinxes were common imaging features in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The thoracic spine tended to be convex to not only the dominant side of the asymmetrically displaced tonsil, but also the deviated side of the eccentrically located syrinx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effect of syrinx deviation on curve convexity is similar to that of dominant tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
