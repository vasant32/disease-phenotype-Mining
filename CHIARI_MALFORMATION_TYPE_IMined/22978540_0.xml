<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) is characterized by hindbrain deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of craniocervical decompression surgery on the anatomical features of hindbrain deformity with a prospective MRI study of patients with CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted in 48 patients with CM-I (39 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo>) treated with craniocervical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical examinations and cervical MRI were performed before surgery and 1 week, 3-6 months, and annually after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hindbrain deformity was defined by tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp>, pointed cerebellar tonsils, and/or cervicomedullary protuberance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The length of the clivus, basiocciput (sphenooccipital synchondrosis to basion), supraocciput (internal occipital protuberance to opisthion), and anteroposterior (AP) width of CSF pathways at the foramen magnum were measured and compared with those from 18 healthy volunteers (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before surgery, the patients' posterior fossa bones were short and their CSF pathways were narrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> (mean [± SD] 12.3 ± 5.1 mm; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 0.3 ± 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients had pointed tonsils and more than two-thirds exhibited a cervicomedullary protuberance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clivus and basiocciput lengths were significantly shorter than the values obtained in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the supraocciput length did not differ significantly from control measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean bulbopontine sulcus distance superior to the basion was 9.5 ± 2.6 mm (vs 13.6 ± 2.8 mm in controls; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The AP widths of the CSF pathways at the level of the foramen magnum were significantly narrowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After surgery, CSF pathways significantly expanded both ventrally and dorsally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By 3-6 months after surgery, pointed tonsils became round, cervicomedullary protuberance disappeared, and tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> diminished by 51% (to 6.0 ± 3.3 mm; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cerebellar tonsils and brainstem assumed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance within 6 months after craniocervical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings support the concept that the CM-I is not a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation</z:e> of the neural elements but rather an acquired malformation that arises from pulsatile impaction of the cerebellar tonsils into the foramen magnum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Clinical trial registration no.: NCT00001327 </plain></SENT>
