<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Section of the filum terminale is proposed as a useful surgical approach in these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between April 1993 and July 2003, a total of 20 patients (8 men and 12 women) with a mean age of 33.5 years underwent section of the filum terminale with or without opening of the dural sac through a standard sacrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, 5 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo>, 2 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> and 5 with a combination of these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDING: After section of the filum terminale, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> showed an early clinical improvement of dysaesthesia, thermo-anaesthesia, hypo-aesthesia and walking difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rising of the medullary conus was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> improved dramatically and a curve reduction was noticed, although progression of the curve was observed in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, dysaesthesia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Section of the filum terminale is a useful strategy in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo>, and offers a new aetiological basis for the understanding of these three disorders </plain></SENT>
