<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous guidelines have recommended simultaneous cranial vault expansion and suboccipital decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, spontaneous resolution of CM-I has been observed, and the combined procedure carries additional surgical risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors report the case of a 6-month-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, CM-I, and a cervical syrinx who underwent posterior cranial vault release without suboccipital decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imaging at the 3-month follow-up visit demonstrated complete resolution of the CM-I, improvement in CSF flow, and reduction in the size of the syrinx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that up-front suboccipital decompression may not be necessary in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A strategy of initial cranial vault release, followed by watchful waiting and radiographic surveillance, is proposed </plain></SENT>
