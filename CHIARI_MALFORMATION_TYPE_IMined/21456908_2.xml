<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The natural history of untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) is poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The object of this study was to investigate outcomes in pediatric patients with CM-I who were followed up without surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed 124 cases involving patients with CM-I who presented between July 1999 and July 2008 and were followed up without surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients ranged in age from 0.9 to 19.8 years (mean 7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of follow-up ranged from 1.0 to 8.6 years (mean 2.83 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imaging findings, symptoms, and findings on neurological examinations were noted at presentation and for the duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> at presentation was 8.35 mm (range 5-22 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had a syrinx at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The syrinx size did not change in these patients on follow-up imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No new syrinxes developed in the remaining patients who underwent subsequent imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total number of patients with presenting symptoms was 81 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of those 81 patients, 67 demonstrated symptoms that were not typical of CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 patients with symptoms attributed to CM-I, 9 had symptoms that were not severe or frequent enough to warrant surgery, and surgery was recommended in the remaining 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I was also diagnosed in 43 asymptomatic patients who had imaging studies performed for various reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No new neurological deficits were noted in any patient for the duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with CM-I who are followed up without surgery do not progress clinically or radiologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up of this cohort will be required to determine if symptoms or new neurological findings develop over the course of many years </plain></SENT>
