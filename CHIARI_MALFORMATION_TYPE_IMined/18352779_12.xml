<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: To better understand syrinx pathophysiology, the authors performed a prospective study in which they used findings from serial clinical and magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging examinations performed before and after craniocervical decompression to establish the time course of syrinx narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial clinical examinations and cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging were performed in 29 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> before surgery, 1 week, and 3-6 months after surgery, and then annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Time to narrowing of the syrinx (&gt;50% decrease in maximal anteroposterior diameter) following surgery was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> syringes decreased in diameter and length (number of segments) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images at 3-6 months, 1 year, and 2 years or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The syrinx diameter decreased from 6.9+/-2.1 mm (mean+/-standard deviation) preoperatively to &lt;1.5 mm at last evaluation (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time to syrinx narrowing was 3.6 months following CM-I decompression (95% confidence interval 3.0-6.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After surgery 94% of patients had improved symptoms, but symptoms resolved incompletely in 68% of patients; 52 and 59% of patients had residual dysesthesias and sensory loss, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement occurred before partial or complete disappearance of the syrinx on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient age, duration of symptoms, sex, preoperative syrinx diameter, and length of syrinx were unrelated to time to syrinx narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients improve after decompression for CM-I, but many have residual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Syringes may continue to diminish for months to years after surgical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A collapsed syrinx (absence of distention of the spinal cord) indicates that the pathophysiology has been reversed by treatment regardless of the completeness of elimination of the cavity on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
