<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Indications for duraplasty in treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the authors evaluate their surgical experience to determine whether intraoperative ultrasonography is effective in the selection of patients with CM-I who can be adequately treated with craniectomy alone without duraplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of 256 children who underwent first-time hindbrain decompression for CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Craniectomy alone (without duraplasty) was performed when intraoperative ultrasonography suggested adequate decompression of the subarachnoid spaces ventral and dorsal to the tonsils after suboccipital craniectomy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Duraplasty was performed if intraoperative ultrasonography demonstrated persistent dural compression of the tonsils following craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptom recurrence as a function of time was compared between cases of duraplasty versus suboccipital decompression alone stratified by extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Duraplasty was performed in 140 patients (55%), and suboccipital decompression alone was performed in 116 patients (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent follow-up for 29 +/- 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in 192 patients (75%) and lower cranial nerve and brainstem dysfunction in 68 (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 38 patients (15%) there was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> rostral to the C-1 lamina, in 195 (76%) it extended between the C-1 and C-2 lamina, and in 23 patients (9%) there was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> caudal to the lower border of the C-2 lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> caudal to C-1, ultrasonography-guided suboccipital decompression alone was associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of symptom recurrence compared with those who also underwent duraplasty (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> rostral to C-1, outcome was equivalent between suboccipital decompression alone and duraplasty (p = 0.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of moderate-to-severe tonsillar CM-I, intraoperative ultrasonography demonstrating decompression of the subarachnoid spaces ventral and dorsal to the tonsils may not effectively select patients in whom bone decompression alone is sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Duraplasty may be warranted in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> that extends below the C-1 lamina regardless of intraoperative ultrasonography findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>More objective cerebrospinal fluid flow or volumetric measures may be needed intraoperatively to guide duraplasty in patients with more pronounced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
