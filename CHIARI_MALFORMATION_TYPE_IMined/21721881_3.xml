<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: In 1998 the authors identified 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging of the entire neuraxis ruled out other causes of a syrinx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, abnormal CSF flow at the foramen magnum was the suspected cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The label "Chiari 0" was used to categorize these unique cases with no tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients underwent posterior fossa decompression and duraplasty identical to the technique used to treat patients with CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant syrinx and symptom resolution occurred in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Herein, the authors report on a follow-up study of patients with CM-0 who were derived from over 400 operative cases of pediatric CM-I decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors present their 12-year experience with this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients (3.7%) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At surgery, many were found to have physical barriers to CSF flow near the foramen magnum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In most of them, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> was greatly diminished postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors stress that this subgroup represents a very small cohort among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They emphasize that careful patient selection is critical when diagnosing CM-0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Without an obvious CM-I, other etiologies of a spinal syrinx must be conclusively ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only then can one reasonably expect to ameliorate the clinical course of these patients via posterior fossa decompression </plain></SENT>
