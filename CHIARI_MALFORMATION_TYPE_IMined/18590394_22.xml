<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) is one of the most common neurosurgical procedures performed in children, although there is clearly no consensus among practitioners about which surgical method is preferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the outcome of posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD) and posterior fossa decompression without duraplasty (PFD) for the treatment of CM-I in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors searched Medline-Ovid, The Cochrane Library, and the conference proceedings of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (2000-2007) for studies meeting the following inclusion criteria: 1) surgical treatment of CM-I; 2) surgical techniques of PFD and PFDD being reported in a single cohort; and 3) patient age &lt; 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five retrospective and 2 prospective cohort studies involving a total of 582 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 582 patients, 316 were treated with PFDD and 266 were treated with PFD alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient age ranged from 6 months to 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing PFDD had a significantly lower reoperation rate (2.1 vs 12.6%, risk ratio [RR] 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08-0.69) and a higher rate of cerebrospinal fluid-related complications (18.5 vs 1.8%, RR 7.64, 95% CI 2.53-23.09) than those undergoing PFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in either clinical improvement (78.6 vs 64.6%, RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.95-1.59) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> decrease (87.0 vs 56.3%, RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.91-2.25) were noted between PFDD and PFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty is associated with a lower risk of reoperation than PFD but a greater risk for cerebrospinal fluid-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the 2 operative techniques with respect to clinical improvement or decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
