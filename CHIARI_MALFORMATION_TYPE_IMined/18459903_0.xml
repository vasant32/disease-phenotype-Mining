<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of radiology charts describing head CT results obtained at Columbus Children's Hospital between January 2004 and January 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The records were searched for the key words "Chiari," "cerebellar ectopy," or "tonsillar ectopy." The exclusion criteria included patients with previously known <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I or Type II or those who had undergone follow-up magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging at other institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Head CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images for the remaining patients were reviewed to verify accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 72 patients with suspicious findings of tonsillar ectopy on CT, only 37 (51.4%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings consistent with CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The tonsillar ectopy in these patients ranged from 3 mm to 17 mm below the foramen magnum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings indicate that incidental standard CT scans of the head have limited value in identifying CM-I </plain></SENT>
