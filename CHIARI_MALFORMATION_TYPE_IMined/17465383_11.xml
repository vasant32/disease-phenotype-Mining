<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Despite progress in the understanding of the causes and pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I), definitive surgical treatment remains unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various techniques have been propounded over the years, but there is no general consensus on the most appropriate surgical management for this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report their experience with the surgical treatment of 30 pediatric patients with CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The results obtained in 30 patients who underwent surgery for symptomatic CM-I with a purely extradural procedure were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient age at operation ranged from 2 months to 16 years (mean 68 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 26 patients the CM-I occurred as an isolated disease, whereas in four a recognized bone anomaly involving the cranial base (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent suboccipital craniectomy, which was accompanied by C-1 laminectomy in 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases a thick fibrous band at the level of foramen magnum was resected; in 11 children serial incisions of the outer layer of the dura mater were performed as well to expand the posterior fossa volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The follow-up duration varied from a minimum of 12 months to 12.6 years (mean 4.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent symptoms and signs were head and/or neck pain (56.7%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> (27.7%), upper-and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007340'>lower-extremity weakness</z:hpo> (20.0%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (20.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>Syringomyelia</z:hpo> was noted in 12 patients (40.0%) on magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improvement in or resolution of clinical symptoms and signs was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, only minimal or no modifications could be found in the position of cerebellar tonsils on postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in most patients (only occasional improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e>), whereas syringomyelic cavitations reduced in size in half of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in only two patients was a reoperation necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the authors' experience, suboccipital craniectomy and C-I laminectomy (eventually integrated by dural delamination) can represent an effective treatment for symptoms associated with CM-I </plain></SENT>
