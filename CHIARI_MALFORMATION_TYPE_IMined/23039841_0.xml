<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Decompression of the foramen magnum is widely accepted as the procedure of choice for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine the mechanisms responsible for neurological deterioration after foramen magnum decompression and the results of secondary interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1987 and 2010, 559 patients with CM-I presented, 107 of whom had already undergone a foramen magnum decompression, which included a syrinx shunt in 27 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty patients who were neurologically stable did not undergo another operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven patients with progressive symptoms received a recommendation for surgery, which was refused by 16 patients, while 51 patients underwent a total of 61 secondary operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hospital and outpatient records, radiographic studies, and intraoperative images were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional follow-up information was obtained by telephone calls and questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short-term results were determined after 3 and 12 months, and long-term outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-one secondary operations were performed after a foramen magnum decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these 61 operations, 15 involved spinal pathologies not related to the foramen magnum (spinal group), while 46 operations were required for a foramen magnum issue (foramen magnum group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Except for occipital pain and swallowing disturbances, the clinical course was comparable in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the spinal group, 5 syrinx shunt catheters were removed because of nerve root irritations or spinal cord tethering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent a total of 10 operations on their cervical spine for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">radiculopathies</z:e> or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No permanent surgical morbidity occurred in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the foramen magnum group, 1 patient required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> 7 months after decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The remaining 45 secondary interventions were foramen magnum revisions, of which 10 were combined with craniocervical fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively, arachnoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> with obstruction of the foramen of Magendie was the most common finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Complication rates for foramen magnum revisions were similar to first decompressions, whereas permanent surgical morbidity was higher at 8.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Postoperative clinical improvements were marginal in both surgical groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>With the exception of 1 patient who underwent syrinx catheter removal and had a history of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the spinal group were able to be stabilized neurologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Long-term results in the foramen magnum group revealed clinical stabilizations in 66% for at least 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neurological deterioration in patients after a foramen magnum decompression for CM-I may be related to new spinal pathologies, craniocervical instability, or recurrent CSF flow obstruction at the foramen magnum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Whereas surgery for spinal pathologies is regularly followed by clinical stabilization, the rate of long-term success for foramen magnum revisions was limited to 66% for 5 years due to severe arachnoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> in a significant proportion of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Therefore, foramen magnum revisions should be restricted to patients with progressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
