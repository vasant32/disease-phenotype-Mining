<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Since the advent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, an increasing number of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic patients have been diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The decision of whether or not to operate is more difficult in these patients than in those with clear symptoms because of the lack of information about the natural course of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors report on their experience in a series of 22 patients with CM-I who were evaluated at the authors' institution, and for whom a conservative approach to treatment was adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients ranged in age from 1 to 16 years (mean 6.3 years) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroradiological and complete clinical examinations were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients 6 months after the first observation and every year thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 3 to 19 years (mean 5.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I was incidentally detected on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in 11 of 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 11 patients had minimal clinical signs at presentation that were not regarded as necessitating immediate surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (77.3%) showed progressive improvement in their symptoms or remained asymptomatic at the last follow-up whereas 5 patients (22.7%) experienced worsening, which was mild in 2 cases and required surgical correction in the remaining 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging a mild reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> was appreciated in 4 patients (18.18%), with complete spontaneous resolution in 1 of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> remained stable during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors' data confirm the common impression that in both asymptomatic and slightly symptomatic patients with CM-I, a conservative approach to treatment should be adopted with periodic clinical and radiological examinations </plain></SENT>
