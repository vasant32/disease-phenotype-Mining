<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Outcome assessment for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type 1 is difficult because of the lack of a reliable and specific surgical outcome assessment scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such a scale could reliably correlate postoperative outcomes with preoperative symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We developed a novel scoring system and applied it retrospectively to 146 patients treated at our institution in order to create and verify a simple and quantifiable assessment of Chiari outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale (CCOS) uses 4 postoperative outcome categories (pain, nonpain symptoms, functionality, and complications) graded 1 to 4 for a total possible score of 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a comparison with current Chiari outcome methodology, each patient was also placed into a gestalt outcome group of "improved," "unchanged," or "worse" (I/U/W) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified by CCOS scores and by I/U/W group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stratifying patients by total CCOS scores showed that patients who achieved CCOS scores between 13 and 16 were predominantly in the I/U/W improved group (n = 101, 69%); scores between 9 and 12 were predominantly I/U/W unchanged (n = 39, 27%), and scores between 4 and 8 were I/U/W worse (n = 6, 4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptom subscore results provided insight into the specifics of the overall outcome in addition to the more quantitative nature of the 16-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We describe a CCOS that assigns higher scores to patients judged improved by gestalt I/U/W ratings and lower scores to those who were unchanged or worse while defining outcome in 4 specific subcategories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As such, this CCOS should allow for a more unified and quantifiable outcome assessment after Chiari surgery </plain></SENT>
