<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies of patients with CM-I have shown alterations in the CSF velocity profile using cardiac-gated cine phase-contrast MRI, and computational simulations have demonstrated that temporal features of the CSF pulse could contribute to syrinx development or enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few studies have reported temporal characteristics of the CSF profile, and few studies have reported on CM-I patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to determine whether specific temporal features of the CSF flow profile may underlie the development or enlargement of a syrinx in patients with CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods Ten healthy volunteers and 18 patients with CM-I with (8 patients) and without (10 patients) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> were studied using cardiac-gated cine phase-contrast MRI, measuring the maximum CSF velocities in the cranial and caudal directions, the timing of these maximums relative to the cardiac cycle time, the timing of caudal flow <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, timing of cranial flow <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and the duration of caudal flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results The caudal CSF flow was significantly faster (p â‰¤ 0.01) and earlier (p &lt; 0.02) in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> than in healthy volunteers and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the CSF velocities between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with CM-I who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> had a significantly later start of caudal CSF flow (p &lt; 0.01) and earlier maximum cranial velocity (p = 0.03) than healthy volunteers, but the relative durations of caudal and cranial flow were not significantly different between any of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions The significantly earlier arrival and earlier peak velocity of caudal CSF flow may underlie the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> in patients with CM-I, and after a syrinx develops the CSF flow profile appears to stabilize </plain></SENT>
