<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors identified, in a prospective endoscopy database, 16 adults and children (age range 2-68 years) with CM-I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> that had been managed with ETV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They reviewed the clinical features and radiographic findings for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients underwent ETV as a primary treatment, whereas 1 patient underwent the procedure at the time of shunt failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> with either aqueductal or fourth <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042512" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ventricular outflow obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 42 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients (94%) remain shunt free following ETV for CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five (83%) of the 6 patients with a syrinx had improvement or resolution of the syrinx following ETV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients (37.5%) underwent foramen magnum decompression for persistent CM-I -- or syrinx-related symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no cerebrospinal fluid leakage or intracranial pressure-related problem following foramen magnum decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy provides a durable method of treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> associated with CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is effective as a primary treatment, and the authors advocate its use as a replacement for routine ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Management of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> alone is often sufficient and may obviate decompression, although a significant proportion of patients will still need both procedures </plain></SENT>
