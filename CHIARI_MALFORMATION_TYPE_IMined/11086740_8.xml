<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The anatomic localization of respiratory centers and their possible injury may explain the presence of respiratory disturbances in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate the polysomnographic findings in a group of patients with CCD, most of them with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold-Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I, since <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> has been referred to in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>isolated cases</z:hpo> in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (seven females and four males) with CCD diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging referred from the neurosurgery unit were submitted to clinical history, physical examination with sleep questionnaires, and scored on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Full night polysomnography was performed in an Oxford SAC system where EEG, electro-oculography, electrocardiography, chin and leg electromyography, chest and abdominal efforts, airflow, and oximetry were recorded continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007099'>Arnold-Chiari type I malformation</z:hpo>, of whom six showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0006933'>associated syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other two had basilar invagination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of these patients complained of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0700201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep problems</z:e> (snoring, <z:mp ids='MP_0003298'>choking</z:mp>, and witnessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apneas</z:hpo>) and 72% presented hypersomnolence (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e> &gt;9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The polysomnographic findings showed sleep fragmentation in 81% of the patients and a reduction of rapid eye movement sleep in 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index was above 5 in 72%, with a predominance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>central apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with craniocervical disorders present a higher probability of displaying sleep respiratory disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their sleep complaints should be assessed and patients should be submitted to an overnight sleep recording in order to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
