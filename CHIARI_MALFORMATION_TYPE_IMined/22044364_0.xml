<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to report the results of a survey of the American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgeons (ASPN) on treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire was circulated during the 2006 meeting of the ASPN, in which surgeons were surveyed on their management of patients with CM-I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The survey consisted of questions about 4 clinical scenarios, common causes of surgical failures, and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 72 respondents, representing more than 90% of attendees at the 2006 ASPN meeting and approximately half of the society's members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of respondents (85%) reported that they perform posterior fossa decompression as first-line treatment for CM-I with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven percent perform bony decompression alone, 36% open the dura, and 27% shrink the tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Very few respondents indicated that they offer syrinx drainage as first-line therapy (&lt; 3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> respondents reported that they treat symptomatic CM-I/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> patients surgically, 15% of respondents indicated that they do not operate on asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, respondents stated that their most common complications are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270687" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudomeningocele</z:e> and chemical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This survey, given to a representative group of experienced North American pediatric neurosurgeons, confirms that posterior fossa decompression is still the preferred treatment modality in children with CM-I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo>, regardless of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although most surgeons open the dura, preferred techniques for decompression vary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the results of past surveys, conservative follow-up is now only used by a minority of respondents and only in the asymptomatic patient, and primary syrinx drainage seems to have lost popularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A multicenter trial of surgical outcomes has been designed based on the information from this survey </plain></SENT>
