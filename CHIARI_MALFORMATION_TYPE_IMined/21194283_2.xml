<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformations</z:hpo> Type I (CM-Is) has increased in recent years, commonly during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging for evaluation of a possible cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment of this abnormality remains controversial, and the expected success of treatment is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study is to evaluate the effects of a craniotomy for CM-I decompression on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors conducted a 10-year retrospective review of pediatric patients who were found to have a CM-I during evaluation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine patients were identified, ranging in age from 6 months to 18 years (median 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 42 girls (54%) and 37 boys (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were noted on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1522522" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hydrosyringomyelia</z:e> of the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients had curvatures less than 20° prior to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other 30 patients had curves ranging from 25° to 80° and underwent orthopedic follow-up and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of these patients were referred for specific neurological complaints, but 12 (16%) had neurological signs on physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were treated with a craniocervical decompression in a standard fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 6 to 93 months with a median of 35 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance images obtained at 6 months postoperatively and serial standing anteroposterior spine radiographs were used to evaluate outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images obtained 6 months postoperatively, 70 patients (89%) had a significant reduction in the syrinx with an associated ascent of the cerebellar tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Persistent large syringes were treated with reoperation in 6 patients, and shunts were inserted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>None of the 49 patients with curves less than 20° had progression of their curvature postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Of the 30 patients with curves greater than 25°, 9 had no change in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> or had a reduction in curve magnitude after Chiari decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This group required no further therapy and was effectively treated by Chiari decompression alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients required further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> treatment after Chiari decompression; 12 required orthotic treatment, 11 received spinal instrumentation and fusion surgery, and 2 received orthoses followed by fusion and instrumentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The severity of the curvature beyond 20° did not predict the need for spinal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This large series reports on the efficacy of treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> associated with a CM-I and syrinx in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A CM-I decompression alone was adequate treatment for mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> of less than 20° </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> greater than 20° required bracing and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> surgery 70% of the time in addition to the CM-I decompression </plain></SENT>
