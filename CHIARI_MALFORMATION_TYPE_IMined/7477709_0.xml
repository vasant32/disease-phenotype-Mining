<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 9-year-old female was admitted to our hospital complaining of lumbosacral pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed no abnormal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed a round shaped mass lesion in the right dorsolateral side of the spinal canal between the level of L1 to S1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mass lesion disclosed isodensity and was not enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A small low density mass lesion was visualized in the dural sac at the same level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI showed the mass lesion with low signal intensity on the T1-weighted image, and high signal intensity on the T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The small mass lesion in the dural sac was demonstrated with low signal intensity on the T1 and T2-weighted image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to this finding, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I was disclosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was suspected that this mass lesion was extradural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cyst</z:hpo> associated with an enlarged filum terminale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Osteoplastic laminotomy between L3 to S1/2 was performed, and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cyst</z:hpo> was found in the intradural space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It compressed the cauda <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017589" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">equina</z:e> and enlarged tough filum terminale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> was removed subtotally, and the filum terminale was cut off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Postoperative course was uneventful and the lumbosacral pain disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It was thought that this pain might be derived from the intradural <z:hpo ids='HP_0100702'>arachnoid cyst</z:hpo>, or the enlarged filum terminale.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
