<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: In this retrospective analysis, the authors report a prospective study in which intraoperative ultrasonography was used to determine the extent of surgery necessary during posterior fossa decompression surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1995 and 2003, posterior fossa decompression was performed in 149 patients (mean 5.9 years of age, range 9 months-18 years of age) with CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 130 underwent intraoperative ultrasonographic evaluation of the craniocervical junction (CCJ) and 15 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Duraplasty and tonsillar shrinkage were performed when ultrasonographic evidence showed significant decreases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or abnormal tonsillar piston action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical success was determined on the basis of clinical outcome and need for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-four (95.5%) of the children had successful outcomes following surgery and six (4.5%) experienced continued or worsening symptoms requiring reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty patients did not undergo duraplasty because the ultrasonography evidence showed adequate decompression with bone removal alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 90 patients with significant compression, decreased CSF dynamics, and/or abnormal tonsillar piston-like action at the CCJ, 85 underwent duraplasty and tonsillar shrinkage and five did not for various reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient in whom the dura mater was violated accidentally during bone decompression subsequently underwent duraplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hospital stays lasted 6.4 +/- 3.9 days (mean +/- standard deviation) when duraplasty was performed compared with 4.3 +/- 1.1 days when it was not (p &lt; 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After bone decompression alone, no patient experienced complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After duraplasty, 12 patients experienced complications and had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and pain more often than patients who underwent bone decompression alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean tonsillar descent was 11 +/- 4 mm after bone decompression only and 13.9 +/- 4.9 mm after duraplasty, with tonsillar shrinkage (p &lt; 0.0003) seen on magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients who undergo decompressive surgery for CM-I, intraoperative ultrasonography may be a useful tool to aid the surgeon in deciding whether to opt for bone removal only or bone removal plus duraplasty and tonsillar shrinkage </plain></SENT>
