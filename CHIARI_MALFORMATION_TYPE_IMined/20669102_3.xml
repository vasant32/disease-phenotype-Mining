<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: There have been several treatment modalities to reduce the volume of the syringomyelic cavity and the pressure on the brainstem in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari Malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Foramen magnum decompression with and without duroplasty were compared in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 2003 to 2006, 27 patients suffering from CMI were operated on at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following were measured: the ratio of the syringomyelic cavity to the spinal cord; pre-operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> from the foramen magnum; pre- and postoperative tonsillo-dural distance; and spinoposterior fossa dural angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 83.3 % of the patients in the non-duroplasty and 73.3% of the patients in the duroplasty group were symptom free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio of syrinx regression was 28+/-10% in the non-duroplasty and 36+/-33% in the duroplasty group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The tonsillodural distance was 3.1+/-1.8 mm in the non-duroplasty and 4.6+/-2.1 mm in the duroplasty group (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spino-posterior fossa dural angle was 133.6+/-9.44 degrees preoperatively and 136.7+/-9.78 degrees postoperatively in the non-duroplasty (p=0.376); 123.7+/-11.7 degrees preoperatively and 129.8+/-11.1 degrees postoperatively in the duroplasty group (p=0.885); no significant difference was found postoperatively (p=0.55, z=1.92), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient was re-operated in the non-duroplasty group and thereafter duroplasty was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Almost the same clinical outcomes can be achieved with and without duroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There might be an option to perform duroplasty if simple procedure fails </plain></SENT>
