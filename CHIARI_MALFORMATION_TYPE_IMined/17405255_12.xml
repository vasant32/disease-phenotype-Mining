<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness and handling characteristics of a dura substitute composed of two outer layers of expanded <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) and a middle layer consisting of an elastomeric fluoropolymer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective multicenter study, the dura substitute was implanted using a standard technique in 119 patients undergoing cranial or spinal surgery requiring duraplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative assessments of the dura patch consisted of testing for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage employing the Valsalva maneuver and a surgeon's standard evaluation of the handling characteristics of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative assessments conducted during a mean follow-up time of 15.7 months (range 0.3-45.6 months) consisted of physical examinations, routine computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging studies, and histological studies of any removed dura patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the 119 patients was 40 years (range &lt; 1-81 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dura substitute was implanted cranially in 102 patients and spinally in 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative assessment including the Valsalva maneuver led to application of additional sutures in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Handling features were rated very good to excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative clinical evaluation resulted in 79 excellent and 18 good results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Imaging studies (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies in 69 patients and CT studies in 34 patients) showed no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> in 87 patients and minimal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> in seven patients (the dura was not visualized in nine patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications occurred in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were six cases of CSF leakage, three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>extradural hematoma</z:hpo>, one case of arachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> after decompression of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I, and two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eight (7%) of these complications were potentially related to the dura patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large, multicenter clinical study of the use of an expanded-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>-containing dura substitute, the device was found to be easy to handle and implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No serious dura patch-related intraoperative adverse events were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, there were no major sealing problems or long-term complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In two cases the patch had to be removed due to <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The three-layer polymer dura substitute appears to be safe and effective in minimizing CSF leakage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> formation, and its use avoids any risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162534" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prion disease</z:e> transmission </plain></SENT>
