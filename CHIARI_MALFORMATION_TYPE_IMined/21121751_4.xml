<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Craniocervical decompression for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> has been reported to fail in 10%-40% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present prospective clinical study was designed to test the hypothesis that in cases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> persists after surgery, craniocervical decompression relieves neither the physiological block at the foramen magnum nor the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors prospectively evaluated and treated 16 patients with CM-I who had persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> despite previous craniocervical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Testing before surgery included the following: 1) clinical examination; 2) evaluation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> using T1-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging; 3) assessment of the syrinx and CSF velocity and flow using cine phase-contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging; and 4) appraisal of the lumbar and cervical subarachnoid pressures at rest, during a Valsalva maneuver, during jugular compression, and following the removal of CSF (CSF compliance measurement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During surgery, ultrasonography was performed to observe the motion of the cerebellar tonsils and syrinx walls; pressure measurements were obtained from the intracranial and lumbar intrathecal spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedure involved enlarging the previous craniectomy and performing an expansile duraplasty with autologous pericranium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three to 6 months after surgery, clinical examination, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, and CSF pressure recordings were repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies were then repeated annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before reexploration, patients had a <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>decreased size</z:mp> of the CSF pathways and a partial blockage in CSF transmission at the foramen magnum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cervical subarachnoid pressure and pulse pressure were abnormally elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During surgery, ultrasonographic imaging demonstrated active pulsation of the cerebellar tonsils, with the tonsils descending during cardiac systole and concomitant narrowing of the upper pole of the syrinx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three months after reoperation, patency of the CSF pathways was restored and pressure transmission was improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The flow of syrinx fluid and the diameter of the syrinx decreased after surgery in 15 of 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Persistent blockage of the CSF pathways at the foramen magnum resulted in increased pulsation of the cerebellar tonsils, which acted on a partially enclosed cervical subarachnoid space to create elevated cervical CSF pressure waves, which in turn affected the external surface of the spinal cord to force CSF into the spinal cord through the Virchow-Robin spaces and to propel the syrinx fluid caudally, leading to syrinx progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A surgical procedure that reestablished the CSF pathways at the foramen magnum reversed this pathophysiological mechanism and resolved <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Elucidating the pathophysiology of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> has implications for its primary and secondary treatment </plain></SENT>
