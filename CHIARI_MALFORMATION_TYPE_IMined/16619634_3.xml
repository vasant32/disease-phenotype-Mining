<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Severely <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) can be life threatening in patients who had previously undergone shunt treatment but who do not experience ventricular enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors analyzed the utility of placing shunts into the cisterna magna concurrently with ventricular shunts in patients who were not candidates for lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients treated with cisterna magna-ventricle-peritoneum (CMVP) shunts for complex problems of shunt function were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had documented increases in ICP and ventricles that did not expand despite life-threatening increases (&gt; 80 mm Hg in one case) in ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between 1995 and 2003, 10 patients (four males and six females, age range 4-32 years) were identified as having life-threatening increases in ICP despite small or slit-like ventricles on imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each episode was documented with intraparenchymal pressure monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had documented ventricular catheter failures at the time of the intervention, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had undergone at least one previous attempt to treat the condition with a valve upgrade and replacement of the ventricular catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002414'>spina bifida</z:hpo>, and three had a preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients improved after the procedure, and none suffered permanent complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For at least 48 hours after surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent intraparenchymal monitoring of ICP (an intraparenchymal monitor was used that documented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CMVP shunts are an excellent option for patients who are not candidates for LP shunts but who have high ICP and ventricles that do not enlarge at shunt failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ability to access the spinal fluid in the cortical subarachnoid space presumably accounts for this success </plain></SENT>
