<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Pediatricians play a vital role in the diagnosis and initial treatment of children with pediatric neurosurgical disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposure of pediatrics residents to neurosurgical diseases during training is inconsistent and is usually quite limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After residency, opportunities for pediatricians' education on neurosurgical topics are few and fall mainly on pediatric neurosurgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The American Association of Neurological Surgery/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Joint Section on Pediatric Neurological Surgery Committee on Education undertook a survey of practicing pediatric neurosurgeons to determine whether focused education of practicing pediatricians might lead to better patient outcomes for children with a sampling of common pediatric neurosurgical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An Internet-based 40-item survey was administered to practicing pediatric neurosurgeons from the US and Canada identified from the roster of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Joint Section of Pediatric Neurological Surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survey topics included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001357'>plagiocephaly</z:hpo>, occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0010301'>spinal dysraphism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002144'>tethered cord</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and endoscopic third ventriculostomy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I, mild or minor head injury, spastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most questions pertained to diagnosis, initial medical treatment, and referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred three (38%) of the 273 practicing pediatric neurosurgeons completed the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of the respondents had completed a pediatric neurosurgery fellowship, and two-thirds were in academic practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two percent of the respondents agreed that the care of pediatric neurosurgical patients could be improved with further education of pediatricians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the opinion of the respondents, the 3 disease topics in greatest need of educational effort were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001357'>plagiocephaly</z:hpo>, occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0010301'>spinal dysraphism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002144'>tethered cord</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Head injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> were given the lowest priorities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This survey identified what practicing pediatric neurosurgeons perceive to be the most important knowledge deficits of their colleagues in pediatrics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These perceptions may not necessarily be congruent with the perceptions of practicing pediatricians themselves; nevertheless, the data from this survey may serve to inform conversations between neurosurgeons and planners of continuing medical education for pediatricians, pediatrics residency program directors, and medical school pediatrics faculty </plain></SENT>
