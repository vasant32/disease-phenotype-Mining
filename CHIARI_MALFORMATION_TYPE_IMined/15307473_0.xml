<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study presents two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold-Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a 26-year old man, right side <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> and left side <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> at high frequencies occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another patient, a 48-year old man also complained of <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> and dizziness, that appeared a year and half ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, this patient had episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and vomit that occurred about one year before main symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both patients ENT examinations were performed as well as an audiological diagnostic battery including tonal- and impedance-audiometry, auditory brainstem responses, distortion product otoacoustic emissions and electroencephalography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed pathological changes in the cerebello-pontine angle region that allowed diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold-Chiari malformation</z:hpo> in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, angio-MRI performed in patient with right side <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> revealed cochleovestibular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027743" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nerve compression syndrome</z:e> on the same side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presumably, both anomalies occurring simultaneously in this patient might be responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> in the right ear, instead of mild or moderate hearing loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> usually expected according to the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The paper presented two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold-Chiari malformation</z:hpo> with co-existing cochleovestibular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027743" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nerve compression syndrome</z:e> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The importance of both audiological diagnostic battery and MRI in diagnostic procedures of this malformation has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
