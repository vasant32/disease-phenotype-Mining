<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Dural substitutes are often needed after neurosurgical procedures to expand or replace dura mater resected during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new dural repair material derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) was evaluated in a prospective multicenter clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2000 and 2003, 59 patients at five different institutions underwent dural reconstruction with the SIS dural substitute, with a minimum follow up of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary goals of the study were to assess the efficacy and safety of the SIS dural substitute according to the rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I decompression (32 patients) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection (18 patients) were the most common procedures performed, with 81% of SIS grafts implanted in the posterior fossa or spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was one case of a CSF leak (1.7%), two cases of wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (3.4%), and no cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (0%) in the 58 patients available for follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases of wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, the SIS graft acted as a barrier to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and was not removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively, a watertight seal was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 59 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On follow-up imaging available in 27 patients there was no evidence of any adverse reaction to the graft or of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The SIS dural substitute demonstrated substantial efficacy in these patients after a mean follow up of 7.3 +/- 2.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, CSF leakage, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> were comparable to those reported for other dural substitute materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A lack of adverse reactions to the graft, favorable safety profile, and clinical efficacy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> point to the utility of this material as an alternative for dural repair </plain></SENT>
