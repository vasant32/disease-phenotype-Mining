<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) is a common pediatric neurosurgery procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Published series report a complication rate ranging from 3% to 40% for this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Historically, many dural substitutes have been used, including bovine grafts, human cadaveric pericardium, synthetic dura, and autologous pericranium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that a recently observed increase in complications was dependent on the graft used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2004 and January 2008, 114 consecutive patients â‰¤ 18 years old underwent primary CM-I decompression using duraplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Records were retrospectively reviewed for short- and intermediate-term complications and operative technique, focusing on the choice of duraplasty graft with or without application of a tissue sealant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 8.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dural graft used was variable: 15 were treated with cadaveric pericardium, 12 with Durepair, and 87 with EnDura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tisseel was used in 75 patients, DuraSeal in 12, and no tissue sealant was used in 27 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall complication rate was 21.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common complications included aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270687" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudomeningocele</z:e>, or a CSF leak requiring reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall complication rates were as follows: cadaveric pericardium 26.7%, Durepair 41.7%, and EnDura 17.2%; reoperation rates were 13%, 25%, and 8.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prior to adopting a different graft product, the overall complication rate was 18.1%; following the change the rate increased to 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complication rates for tissue sealants were 14.8% for no sealant, 18.7% for Tisseel, and 50% for DuraSeal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were treated with the combination of Durepair and DuraSeal and this subgroup had a 56% complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Complication rates after CM-I decompression may be dependent on the dural graft with or without the addition of tissue sealant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The complication rate at the authors' institution approximately doubled following the adoption of a different graft product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Tissue sealants used in combination with a dural substitute to augment a duraplasty may increase the risk of aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and/or CSF leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of the apparent increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> with this combination remains under investigation </plain></SENT>
