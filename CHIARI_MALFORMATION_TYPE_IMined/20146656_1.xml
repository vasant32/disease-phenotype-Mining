<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Germline activating mutations of the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) gene have been considered as the only known cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> nonautoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the long-term follow-up and evaluation of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> nonautoimmune primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> who was found to have a de novo germline activating mutation of the TSHR gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The patient was an infant who presented at the age of 10 months in an unconscious state with exsiccation, wet skin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonautoimmune primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> was diagnosed, and brain magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography showed also <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold-Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8502">propylthiouracil</z:chebi> treatment resulted in a prolonged clinical cure lasting for 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the age of 11 years and 5 months the patient underwent subtotal thyroidectomy because of symptoms of trachea compression caused by a progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005987'>multinodular goiter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 2 months after surgery, hormonal evaluation indicated recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> and the patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8502">propylthiouracil</z:chebi> during the next 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the age of 15 years the patient again developed symptoms of trachea compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Radioiodine treatment resulted in a regression of the recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000853'>goiter</z:hpo> and a permanent cure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> without relapse during the last 3 years of his follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of exon 10 of the TSHR gene showed a de novo heterozygous germline I630L mutation, which has been previously described as activating mutation at somatic level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154141" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">toxic thyroid nodules</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The I630L mutation of the TSHR gene occurs not only at somatic level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154141" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">toxic thyroid nodules</z:e>, but also its presence in germline is associated with nonautoimmune primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our case report demonstrates that in this disorder a continuous growth of the thyroid occurs without any evidence of elevated TSH due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50671">antithyroid drug</z:chebi> overdosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may justify previous recommendations for early treatment of affected patients with removal of as much thyroid tissue as possible </plain></SENT>
