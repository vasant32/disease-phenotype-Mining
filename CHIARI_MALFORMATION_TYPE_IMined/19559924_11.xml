<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of CM-I is incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe an association of CM-I and TCS that occurs in a subset of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> size of the PCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prevalence of TCS was determined in a consecutively accrued cohort of 2987 patients with CM-I and 289 patients with low-lying cerebellar tonsils (LLCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings in 74 children and 244 adults undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SFT</z:e> were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Posterior cranial fossa size and volume were measured using reconstructed 2D computed tomographic scans and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were compared to those in 155 age- and sex-matched healthy control individuals and 280 patients with generic CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationships of neural and osseus structures at the CCJ and TLJ were investigated morphometrically on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative CDU was used to measure anatomical structures and CSF flow in the lumbar theca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002144'>Tethered cord</z:hpo> syndrome was present in 408 patients with CM-I (14%) and 182 patients with LLCT (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 318 patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SFT</z:e>, there were no significant differences in the size or volume of the PCF as compared to healthy control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Morphometric measurements demonstrated elongation of the brain stem (mean, 8.3 mm; P &lt; .001), downward displacement of the medulla (mean, 4.6 mm; P &lt; .001), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> position of the CMD except in very young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients with generic CM-I, the FM was significantly enlarged (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The FT was typically thin and taut (mean transverse diameter, 0.8 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SFT</z:e>, the cut ends of the FT distracted widely (mean, 41.7 mm) and CSF flow in the lumbar theca increased from a mean of 0.7 cm/s to a mean of 3.7 cm/s (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were improved or resolved in 69 children (93%) and 203 adults (83%) and unchanged in 5 children (7%) and 39 adults (16%) and, worse, in 2 adults (1%) over a follow-up period of 6 to 27 months (mean, 16.1 months +/- 4.6 SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging 1 to 18 months after surgery (mean, 5.7 months +/- 3.8 SD) revealed upward migration of the CMD (mean, 5.1 mm, P &lt; .001), ascent of the cerebellar tonsils (mean, 3.8 mm, P &lt; .001), reduction of brain stem length (mean, 3.9 mm, P &lt; .001), and improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I/TCS appears to be a unique clinical entity that occurs as a continuum with LLCT/TCS and is distinguished from generic CM-I by enlargement of the FM and the absence of a small PCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Distinctive features include elongation and downward displacement of the hindbrain, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> position of the CMD, tight FT, and reduced CSF flow in the lumbar theca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There is preliminary evidence that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SFT</z:e> can reverse moderate degrees of tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> and is appropriate treatment for cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> after Chiari surgery in this cohort </plain></SENT>
