<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although good results have been reported with the use of some of these materials in cranial surgery, there is a paucity of information regarding their use in craniocervical decompressive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report three cases of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I who experienced recurrent or new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> Chiari symptoms after surgical decompression and duraplasty with bovine pericardium, Gore-Tex or cadaveric dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We review the use of these materials and propose possible mechanisms by which a reaction to a nonautologous graft could cause recurrent Chiari symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preferential use of autologous material for dural grafts during posterior fossa decompressive surgery should prevent this cause of symptom recurrence </plain></SENT>
