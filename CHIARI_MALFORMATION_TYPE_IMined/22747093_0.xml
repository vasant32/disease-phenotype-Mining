<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The charts of 48 consecutive pediatric patients surgically treated for CM-I were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients ranged in age from 2 to 17 years with an average age of 9.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common presentations were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, affecting 34 patients (71%), and pain (neck, back, or extremities), affecting 21 patients (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients (56%) had a syrinx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 48 patients underwent PFDD utilizing acellular tissue matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average hospital stay overall was 3.56 days, whereas the average stay for patients with (29 [60%] of 48) or without (19 [40%] of 48) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> was 3.72 and 3.32 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds of a patient having a hospital stay of 4 or more days was nearly 3 times greater in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> as compared with patients without either condition (OR 2.73, 95% CI 0.74-10.11, p = 0.1330) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average hospital stay for patients 0-8 years of age was 3.29 days; and for those 9-17 years of age, 3.78 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds of a patient having a hospital stay of 4 or more days was nearly 4 times greater in 9- to 17-year-olds as compared with 0- to 8-year-olds (OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.03-13.52, p = 0.0455) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Forty patients (89%) experienced early improvement in their signs and symptoms following PFDD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 2 revision PFDDs (4%) </plain></SENT>
