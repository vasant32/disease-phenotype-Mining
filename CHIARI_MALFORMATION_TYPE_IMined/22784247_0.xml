<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The use of drains in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> has a simple and immediate appeal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Syringopleural shunting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> has produced good short-term results, but limited information is available on long-term effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the complications and long-term outcomes after syringopleural shunting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourthy-four patients with large-sized <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> underwent syringopleural shunting because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> between 1992 and 2010 in our clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I (Group B), and 12 patients were associated with primary parenchymal cavitations (Group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 14 to 71 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both craniovertebral decompression and syringopleural shunting were performed on 21 patients, whereas only syringopleural shunting was performed on another 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The follow-up period ranged from 1 year to 17 years (mean: 9.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative MRI revealed that syringes of 43 patients had collapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 9 (20.5%) minor complications in 9 patients, including temporary neurological deficits (6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> (2) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven (15.9%) serious complications [permanent neurological deficit (1), shunt migration (2), shunt misplacement (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005881'>spinal instability</z:hpo> (1), tethering (1), CSF over drainage (1)] were seen in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four of them were treated with a secondary operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three patients (3/9; 33.3%) who were treated by syringopleural shunt alone (Group B2) required craniovertebral decompression, although the shunt was functional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During long-term follow-up, three patients stabilized, five patients (11.3%) developed a worse neurological condition, and two of these patients died 10 and 7 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 88.6% showed significant clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although there were complications and failures, syringopleural shunting produced satisfactory results at long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
