<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The clinical characteristics of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> have been reported in previous studies, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> in adults is rarely treated, and there is a paucity of detailed studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I, the authors investigated the relationships among the syrinx, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and neurological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The population was composed of 27 patients (&gt; or = 20 years of age) who underwent foramen magnum decompression for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups: those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> of 10 degrees or more (Group A) and those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors assessed the length of the syrinx, duration of morbidity, and clinical status before and after surgery based on the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 15 cases in Group A and 12 in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean length of the syrinx was 12.8 vertebral bodies (VBs) in Group A and 7.2 VBs in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of morbidity was 14.2 years in Group A and 6.8 years in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean preoperative JOA score was 10.1 in Group A and 14.4 in Group B, whereas the mean postoperative JOA scores were 11.9 and 15.8, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences between Groups A and B in length of the syrinx, duration of morbidity, and pre- and postoperative JOA scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> the syringes spanned a greater number of VBs, the duration of morbidity was greater, neurological dysfunction was more severe, and surgical results were poorer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>Scoliosis</z:hpo> could be a predicting factor of the prognosis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I </plain></SENT>
