<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2005 and June 2006, 11 adult patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I underwent a standardized PF decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A prospective evaluation with clinical examination, functional grading, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging measurement protocols was performed pre- and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A method is reported for the measurement of PF volume (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi>) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> increase was compared with the preoperative size of the PF and with the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 11 patients improved postoperatively, with complete and partial recovery in 4 and 7 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No postoperative complication occurred after a mean follow-up period of 45 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean relative increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> accounted for 10% (range 1.5%-19.7%) of the initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi>; the increase was greater in cases in which the PF was small (r = -0.52, p = 0.09) and the basiocciput was short (r = -0.37, p = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant positive correlation was found between the degree of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> increase and the treatment response (p = 0.014); complete recovery was observed with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> increase of 15% and partial recovery with an increase of 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The treatment response is significantly influenced by the degree of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> increase, which is dependent on the size of the PF and the extent of the craniectomy, suggesting that the optimal patient-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> increase could be predicted on the basis of preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and enhancing the perspective that the craniectomy size could be tailored to the individual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
