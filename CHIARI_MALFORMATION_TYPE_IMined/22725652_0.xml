<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients who fail to respond to standard surgical management often have complex anomalies of the craniovertebral junction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo>, requiring reduction and occipitocervical fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that a subgroup of "complex" patients defined by specific radiographic risk factors may have a higher rate of requiring occipitocervical fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of clinical and radiographic data in pediatric patients undergoing surgery for CM-I between 1995 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following radiographic criteria were identified: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo>, CM Type 1.5, medullary kinking, basilar invagination, tonsillar descent, craniocervical angulation (clivoaxial angle [CXA] &lt; 125°), and ventral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo> (pB-C2 ≥ 9 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine the independent association between occipitocervical fusion and each variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 206 patients who underwent CM decompression with or without occipitocervical fusion during the study period, 101 had preoperative imaging available for review and formed the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age at surgery was 9.1 years, and mean follow-up was 2.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two patients underwent suboccipital decompression alone (mean age 8.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients underwent occipitocervical fusion (mean age 11.1 years), either as part of the initial surgical procedure or in a delayed fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors demonstrating a significantly increased risk of requiring fusion were basilar invagination (HR 9.8, 95% CI 2.2-44.2), CM 1.5 (HR 14.7, 95% CI 1.8-122.5), and CXA &lt; 125° (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.2-12.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with basilar invagination, CM 1.5, and CXA &lt; 125° are at increased risk of requiring an occipitocervical fusion procedure either as an adjunct to initial surgical decompression or in a delayed fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients and their families should be counseled in regard to these findings as part of a preoperative CM evaluation </plain></SENT>
