<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of patients who presented to the neurosurgery department before their 6th birthday and subsequently underwent surgery for CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They identified 39 patients who had been evaluated between 1984 and 2007 and examined the medical records for presentation, surgical intervention, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children aged 0-2 years commonly presented with oropharyngeal dysfunction (77.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children aged 3-5 years more frequently presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> (85.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (38.1%), and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (57.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent posterior fossa craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in many patients cervical laminectomy and/or duraplasty was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A few patients required transoral decompression and occipitocervical fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In most cases, surgery led to resolution or dramatic improvement of initial symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and surgical treatment of CM-I in young children leads to good outcomes in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional therapies for oropharyngeal dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> can frequently be avoided </plain></SENT>
