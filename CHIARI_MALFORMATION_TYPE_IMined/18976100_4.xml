<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has not been previously described in monozygotic twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two children, approximately 1 year of age with CM-I and presumed episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0003717'>pallid</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or breath-holding spells presented for neurosurgical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although Chiari decompression was considered, the authors decided to proceed with conservative management with close follow-up due to the uncertain nature of these episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 4 years later, both children's symptoms had resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging examinations also showed spontaneous resolution of the malformation in both girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cases emphasize that when patients with CM-I present with atypical symptoms, spontaneous resolution or improvement is possible, which may influence the decision to pursue a trial of nonsurgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible pathophysiological mechanisms and genetic influences of CM-I are also briefly discussed </plain></SENT>
