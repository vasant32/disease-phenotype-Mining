<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent MRI scan before and after surgical decompression of the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Images of the craniocervical junction confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and allowed the definition of two anatomically distinct types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of the 30 patients (70%) had concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and were classified as type A, while the remaining 9 patients (30%) had evidence of frank <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum without evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and were labeled type B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type A patients had a predominant central cord symptomatology; type B patients exhibited signs and symptoms of brain stem or cerebellar compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concomitant cord cavitary lesions (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo>) were noncommunicating (isolated syrinxes), which were separated from the fourth ventricle by a syrinx-free segment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Holocord hydromyelic cavities were seen in 8 out of 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo>, isolated cervical cavities were seen in 4 patients, while combined cervical and thoracic cavities were seen in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kinking of the medullocervical junction and brain stem was seen in 20 out of 30 patients (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI has proved to be an excellent, noninvasive means of studying of the craniocervical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>; it has allowed a classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> based on objective anatomic criteria with prognostic and clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
