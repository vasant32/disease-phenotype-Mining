<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Standard surgical treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I was successfully performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, immediately after the patient was extubated, she developed signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> and chest radiography revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her ventilation was assisted by maintaining positive end-expiratory pressure at 8 cmH2O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her respiratory status improved 12 hours later, and she was extubated 3 days after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postextubational course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 2 weeks after extubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial neurological deficits had mostly disappeared by 10 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This unusual case of negative pressure <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve paresis</z:hpo> are further risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> as a postextubational complication of surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
