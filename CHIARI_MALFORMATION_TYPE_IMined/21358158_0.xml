<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The arachnoid membrane was not injured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative echography showed good enlargement of the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No closed subcutaneous drain was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient complained of repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> 3 hours after the operation, and computed tomography revealed remote <z:hpo ids='HP_0011695'>cerebellar hemorrhage</z:hpo> on postoperative day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011695'>cerebellar hemorrhage</z:hpo> was treated conservatively, and the symptoms continued only for 3 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dural opening with rapid loss of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has occurred in every reported case of remote <z:hpo ids='HP_0011695'>cerebellar hemorrhage</z:hpo> complicating intracranial and spinal procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss of CSF is the main pathogenesis of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our case, the most probable pathomechanism seems to involve stretching of the infratentorial cerebellar bridging veins due to cerebellar sagging because of dural opening in the prone position and drop in CSF pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such a complication is rare but should be considered after foramen magnum decompression surgery if the patient shows unusual symptoms of repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
