<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) is often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear which subgroups of patients are most likely to experience progression of spinal deformity after cervicomedullary decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors' goal was to determine the time frame of curvature progression and assess which patient subgroups are at greatest risk for progression of spinal deformity after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pediatric patients with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in whom suboccipital decompression was performed to treat for CM-I during a 10-year period at a single academic institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical, radiological, and operative variables were assessed as independent factors for failure (worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>) by using a univariate regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one children (mean age 9 +/- 3 years; 4 male) underwent hindbrain decompression for CM-I-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and were followed for a mean of 39 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients harbored a syrinx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (38%) experienced improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> curvature, whereas 10 (48%) suffered a progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thoracolumbar junction <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (p = 0.04) and failure of the syrinx to improve (p = 0.05) were associated with 5- and 4-fold respective increases in the likelihood of deformity progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Each increasing degree of preoperative Cobb angle was associated with an 11% increase in the likelihood of scoliotic curve progression (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Over one third of patients with CM-I-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> will improve after cervicomedullary decompression alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cervicomedullary decompression is a good first-line option, particularly in children with concordant posterior fossa symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (increasing Cobb angle) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> that crosses the thoracolumbar junction may benefit from earlier orthopedic involvement and should be monitored regularly for curvature progression after cervicomedullary decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In cases in which there is a failure of the syrinx to show improvement after suboccipital decompression, the patients are also more likely to develop curvature progression </plain></SENT>
