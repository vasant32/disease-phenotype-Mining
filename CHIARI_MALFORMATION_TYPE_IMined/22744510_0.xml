<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In small sample studies published recently, there was an observation that curve direction tended to be on the same side as the dominant side of tonsillar displacement or the deviated side of syrinx location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, a large-sample study of patients with single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002943'>thoracic scoliosis</z:hpo> secondary to CMI and SM was performed to validate these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical and radiographic data of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> secondary to SM and CMI were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And patients who met the inclusion criteria were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the imaging presentation, the asymmetry of tonsillar displacement, syrinx location and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> were judged by quantitative method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then the imaging association among asymmetrically displaced tonsil, eccentrically located syrinx and curve direction were further analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients with single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002943'>thoracic scoliosis</z:hpo> secondary to CMI and SM were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>80% subjects showed concordance between the deviated side of eccentrically located syrinx and the dominant side of asymmetrically displaced tonsil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 86% patients with asymmetrically displaced tonsil, thoracic curve was convex to the dominant side of tonsillar displacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 68% of patients with eccentrically located syrinx, the convex side of thoracic curve was on the same side as the deviated side of syrinx location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Asymmetrically displaced tonsils and eccentrically located syrinx are common imaging presentations in patients with SM secondary to CMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002943'>thoracic scoliosis</z:hpo> in these patients was usually convex not only to the dominant side of asymmetrically displaced tonsils, but also to the side of eccentrically located syrinx, indicating that the asymmetry of tonsillar displacement and syrinx location might be involved in the regulation of curve direction </plain></SENT>
