<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: IIH is a syndrome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, mass, or identifiable cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is made by clinical presentation, intracranial pressure measurement, and supportive imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subset of patients with IIH may have tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp>, meeting the criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I but not responding to surgical decompression for Chiari I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of cerebellar tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> in patients with IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with clinically confirmed IIH and 44 age-matched controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two neuroradiologists with CAQs reviewed sagittal T1-weighted MRI in a blinded fashion and measured cerebellar tonsil and obex positions relative to the foramen magnum and prepontine cistern width at the level of the midpons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine of 43 patients with IIH and 1/44 controls had cerebellar tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> of ≥5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of 9 of patients with IIH with <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> of ≥5 mm also had a "peglike" tonsil configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with IIH had a significantly lower tonsillar position (2.1 ± 2.8 mm) than age-matched controls (0.7 ±1.9 mm, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The obex position was significantly lower in patients with IIH versus controls (-7.9 mm [above the FM] versus -9.4 mm [above the FM], P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prepontine width was not significantly different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebellar tonsil position in patients with IIH was significantly lower than that in age-matched controls, often times peglike, mimicking Chiari I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A significantly lower obex position suggests an inferiorly displaced brain stem and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When tonsillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> of &gt;5 mm is identified, imaging and clinical consideration of IIH are warranted to avoid misdiagnosis as Chiari I </plain></SENT>
