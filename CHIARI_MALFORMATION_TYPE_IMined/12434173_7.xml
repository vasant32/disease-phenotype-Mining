<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reducible atlanto-axial dislocation (AAD) may cause severe motor and respiratory compromise due to recurrent spinal cord and/or brain stem impingement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study concentrating on the classification, the protocol of the surgical management and the outcome of congenital, reducible AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 109 patients with congenital, reducible AAD underwent posterior stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their preoperative disability was graded as: I (n=11, 10.09%) no functional disability (a history of minor trauma led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo> that subsequently improved); II (n=31, 28.44%) independent for activities of daily living with minor disability; III (n=42, 38.53%) partially dependent on others for their daily needs; and, IV (n=25, 22.93%) totally dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were classified into 4 groups depending upon their association with: a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> odontoid and posterior arch of atlas (n=27); a dysplastic odontoid and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> posterior arch (n=25); an assimilated posterior arch (n=49); and, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with a dysplastic odontoid had a "hypermobile" AAD with an unrestricted backward and forward movement of the axis relative to the atlas in flexion as well as in extension of the neck, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedures included Brooks' (n=12) or modified Brooks' C1-2 fusion (n=39); Goel's C1-2 fusion (3); Ransford's contoured rod fusion (n=7); Jain's occipitocervical fusion (n=47); and, transoral decompression and Jain's occipitocervical fusion (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 6 peri-operative mortalities in the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: At follow-up (ranging from 3 months to 6 years; n=86), 64 patients had shown improvement by one grade or more; 8 patients, who had a history of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo> but were without neurological deficits at presentation, remained in grade I; 11 had achieved stabilization of neurological functions; while 3 had deteriorated despite adequate radiological reduction of AAD and fusion of the construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A follow-up of 6 months or more was available in 79 of these 86 patients, in whom a dynamic intrathecal CT scan showed a good osseous union </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The patients with congenital reducible AAD, depending on their surgical management, may be classified into four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some patients with a dysplastic odontoid have a "hypermobile" AAD and require special care during intubation, positioning and stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An assimilated posterior arch is often associated with asymmetrical lateral occipito-C1-C2 joint <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> rendering transarticular screw placement difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The various causes of failure of constructs are discussed </plain></SENT>
