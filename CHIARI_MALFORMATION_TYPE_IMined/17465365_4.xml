<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dural closure was performed with a dural substitute patch, hydrogel dural sealant, and gelatin sponge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging, performed after initial postoperative improvement in the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo> deteriorated, demonstrated an expanding epidural mass collection causing cervicomedullary compression </plain></SENT>
