<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the lengths of PCF parameters were studied in adult CMI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively examined 15 adult patients with CMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple measurements were made on magnetic resonance images (MRIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with the findings in 25 controls and 30 dry skulls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Length of the neural structures did not significantly differ between the CMI and the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average length of the basiocciput was significantly shorter in the CMI group as compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean length of the supraocciput was significantly shorter and the average diameter of the foramen magnum was significantly longer in the CMI group when compared to the control group and dry skulls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The morphometric data suggest that, in CMI, a hypoplastic occipital bone, possibly due to the paraxial mesodermal defect of the parachordal plate, causes overcrowding in PCF, which contains the normally developed neural structures </plain></SENT>
