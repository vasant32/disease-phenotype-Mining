<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of duraplasty based on cerebellar tonsillar descent (CTD) grade in the surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I (CM-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 82 patients with surgical correction of CM-I performed at the authors' clinic from 1998-2009 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preoperative CTD grading scale was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided two groups: duraplasty group (group 1) and nonduraplasty group (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preoperative and postoperative size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> cavity, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, recovery rate, and postoperative complications were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was 58 patients in group 1, who underwent combined foramen magnum decompression, C1 (and C2 if necessary) laminectomy, and duraplasty; the 24 patients in group 2 underwent posterior fossa decompression (PFD) alone with no dural opening performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between preoperative and postoperative size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> cavity and JOA scores of duraplasty (group 1) and nonduraplasty (group 2) groups in CTD grades 1 and 2; in CTD grade 3, the decrease in syrinx cavity and clinical improvement were statistically better in group 1 compared with group 2 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications in group 1 were statistically significantly increased compared with group 2 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that PFD and duraplasty for the treatment of CTD grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> may lead to a more reliable reduction in the volume of concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and JOA scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In CTD grade 1 and 2 patients, PFD without duraplasty may be performed </plain></SENT>
