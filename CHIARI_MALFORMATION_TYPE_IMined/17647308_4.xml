<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A search of the current medical literature revealed scant information regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> presentations of CM-I in either pediatric or adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report on two children who presented with rapidly worsening neurological symptoms attributable to a previously undiagnosed CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient became profoundly hypopneic with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> over a less than 48-hour period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second patient presented with a few days of worsening right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009916'>anisocoria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Few reports detail <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptoms due to CM-I and those that do exist almost exclusively involve adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although seemingly rare, the clinician should consider CM-I in the differential diagnosis in pediatric patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brainstem or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002423'>long tract signs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
