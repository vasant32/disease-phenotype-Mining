<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) with an associated spinal syrinx is a common pediatric diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the relative age-related prevalence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging characteristics of these associated conditions may lead to improved treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of 14,116 consecutive individuals 18 years of age or younger who had undergone brain or cervical spine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging at the University of Michigan between November 1997 and August 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients with CM-I, demographic, clinical, and radiographic information was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five hundred nine children (3.6%) with CM-I were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 23% also had a spinal cord syrinx, and 86% of the syringes were found in the cervical spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging prevalence of CM-I with a syrinx was 1.2% in girls and 0.5% in boys (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The severity of impaired CSF flow at the foramen magnum was associated with the amount of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> (p &lt; 0.0001) and conformation of the tonsils (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with CM-I were treated surgically in 35% of cases; these patients exhibited more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> (p &lt; 0.0001) and impaired CSF flow (p &lt; 0.0001) as compared with those who did not undergo surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On imaging, 32% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with CM-I were considered symptomatic by the treating physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients were more likely to be considered symptomatic if they were female, had a syrinx, displayed abnormal tonsillar pulsations, or had a greater amount of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study the authors describe the age-related prevalence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging characteristics of CM-I and its association with a syrinx and other abnormalities in a large group of children who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging for any indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Syringes are more common in older children, in girls, and in patients with a greater degree of tonsillar descent and CSF flow impairment </plain></SENT>
