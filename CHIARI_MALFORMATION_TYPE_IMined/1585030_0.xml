<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interest of the case rest both in the rich symptomatology and multiple exams performed which represent the evolution of the neuroradiological techniques of the last thirty years for the study of ACM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, neurophysiologic exams such as somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) helped to further evaluate these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite such diagnostic evolution, there is no definite etiopathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as for therapeutics, the best approach is still the Gardner surgical technique, which, at the moment, is debated for frequent post-operative complications and the absence of significant clinical improvement, especially in the most severe cases </plain></SENT>
