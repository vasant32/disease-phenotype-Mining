<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are still many questions concerning the pathology and therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently encountered a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> associated with only bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abducens nerve palsy</z:e> which was successfully treated by foramen magnum decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathology and mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> (type I) were evaluated in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 12-year-old girl who had visited our institute 1 month previously complaining of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had no particular past or family history and her general appearance was also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abducens nerve palsy</z:e> was the only neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her cerebrospinal pressure was 9 cm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuroradiological findings revealed basilar impression, C4-6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> (type I), but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002435'>meningocele</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Foramen magnum decompression with lateral extension, upper cervical laminectomy and open duraplasty were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The position of both eyes recovered fully shortly after surgery, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> occurred only when the patient looked sideways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eye movements also returned completely to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRI showed no <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> 4 months after surgery, the upward shift of the pendulous portion of the cerebellar tonsil, and the expansion of the subarachnoidal space of the pons-oblongata junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it was thought that the mechanism of bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abducens nerve palsy</z:e> in this case was due to the strangulation and the downward traction of the pons-oblongata junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The nerve was relieved from this traction by foramen magnum decompression </plain></SENT>
