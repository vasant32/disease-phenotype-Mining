<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the authors summarize their experience with these patients' clinical presentation, imaging results, timing of surgery, and outcome following decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed clinical records, imaging studies, and operative notes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing posterior fossa decompression for CM-I at St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Louis Children's Hospital from 1990 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 189 patients who underwent surgery, 6 were identified with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of a neurological deficit at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 children (age range 3-14 years, 3 boys and 3 girls) had either <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> (5 patients) or T2 signal changes in the spinal cord (1 patient) and CM-I on initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented after minor trauma (1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo>, 2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficits</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented without a clear history of trauma (1 with abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, 2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficits</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decompression was performed at a mean 7.7 ± 4.9 days after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (7.0 ± 1.6 days after neurosurgical evaluation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, symptoms had resolved by the time of surgery; in the remainder of the patients, clear improvements were noted within 2 weeks of surgery, with complete resolution of symptoms by 12 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were obtained in 4 patients, demonstrating improvement in the extent of the syrinx in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Children with CM-I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> can develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> spinal cord or bulbar deficits with relatively minor head or neck injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for symptomatic improvement in the observed deficit is good, with each patient in our series showing resolution of deficits over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, based on this relatively limited experience, the authors suggest that patients who present with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological deficit and are found to have CM-I be managed with early posterior fossa decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with CM-I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> may be at higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological deficit than those without a syrinx </plain></SENT>
