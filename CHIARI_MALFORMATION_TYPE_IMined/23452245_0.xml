<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the mechanisms leading to postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> shrinkage, the authors studied the hydrodynamic changes of CSF flow in the craniocervical junction and spinal canal in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> after one-stage deformity correction by posterior vertebral column resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods Preoperative and postoperative CSF flow dynamics at the levels of the foramen magnum, C-7, T-7 (or apex), and L-1 were assessed by electrocardiogram-synchronized cardiac-gated PC-cine MRI in 8 adolescent patients suffering from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and CM-I (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> group) and undergoing posterior vertebral column resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An additional 8 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and CM-I without spinal deformity (syrinx group) and 8 healthy volunteers (control group) were also enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean values were obtained for the following parameters: the duration of a CSF cycle, the duration of caudad CSF flow (CSF downflow [DF]) and cephalad CSF flow (CSF upflow [UF]), the ratio of DF duration to CSF cycle duration (DF%), and the ratio of UF duration to CSF cycle duration (UF%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the stationary phase (SP) duration to CSF cycle duration was calculated (SP%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum downflow velocities (VDmax) and maximum upflow velocities (VUmax) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SPSS (version 14.0) was used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results Patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> group underwent one-stage posterior vertebral column resection for deformity correction without suboccipital decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean preoperative coronal Cobb angle was 102.4° (range 76°-138°) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean postoperative Cobb angle was 41.7° (range 12°-75°), with an average correction rate of 59.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, 1 patient with hypermyotonia experienced a significant decrease of muscle tension and 1 patient with reduced anal sphincter tone manifested recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A total of 5 patients demonstrated a significant decrease (&gt; 30%) in syrinx size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With respect to changes in CSF flow dynamics, the syrinx group was characterized by slower and shorter downflow than the control group, and the difference was more significant at the foramen magnum and C-7 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, CSF downflow at the foramen magnum level was significantly restricted, and a prolonged stationary phase indicated increased obstruction of CSF flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After posterior vertebral column resection, the peak velocity of CSF flow at the foramen magnum increased, and the downflow phase duration was markedly prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The parameters showed a return to almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF dynamics at the craniocervical region, and this improvement was maintained for 6-12 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Conclusions There were distinct abnormalities of CSF flow at the craniocervical junction in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Abnormal dynamics of downflow could be aggravated by associated severe spinal deformity and improved by correction via posterior vertebral column resection </plain></SENT>
