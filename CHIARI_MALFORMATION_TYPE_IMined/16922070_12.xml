<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors sought to establish whether the volume of the posterior fossa in children suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) is smaller than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, as has been suggested previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They also investigated the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> in posterior fossa development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both posterior fossa volume (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi>) and intracranial volume (ICV) were measured using segmentation techniques on preoperative magnetic resonance images obtained in 42 children who underwent surgery for CM-I (mean age 127 months, range 36-204 months); 25 (59%) of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi>/ICV ratio was calculated to eliminate differential supratentorial growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had deformities potentially interfering with skull growth or who had undergone a shunt insertion procedure prior to craniovertebral decompression were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with measurements of 51 healthy children using one-way analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with CM-I only, the mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi>/ICV ratios were not statistically different than those for healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with both CM-I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> (CM-S), the mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi>/ICV ratios were statistically smaller than those for healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ICV was 1383 cm3 in the healthy group, 1459 cm3 in the CM-I only group, and 1400 cm3 in the CM-S group (p = 0.363); the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> was 186 cm3 in the healthy group, 196 cm3 in the CM-I only group, and 171 cm3 in the CM-S group (p = 0.036); the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi>/ICV ratio was 0.135 in the healthy group, 0.134 in the CM-I only group, and 0.122 in the CM-S group (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These differences were more prominent in the first 10 years of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Children with isolated CM-I do not have a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> smaller than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, whereas children with both CM-I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> have a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55309">PFV</z:chebi> significantly smaller than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that the two subgroups may represent different phenotypic expression or even a different pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
