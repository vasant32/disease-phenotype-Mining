<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study clinical features of the disease, neurological examination, craniography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar predisposing factors and groups of objective neurological symptoms were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences in the first subjective appearance and age at the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with isolated CM, brain stem and cerebella symptoms dominated in the clinical picture, with spinal disturbances and asymptomatic cases being sometimes found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with CM + SM, brain stem and spinal disturbances were more frequent and severe, comparing to those with single CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar clinical features are due probably to common disease pathogenesis and the different ones are the result of the cerebrospinal fluid disturbances, causing intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephaly</z:hpo> and SM </plain></SENT>
