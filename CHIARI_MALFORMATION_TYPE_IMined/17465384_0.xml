<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Occasional comments are found in the literature regarding patients with lipomyelomeningocele and concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The object of this study was to explore the association between these two conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective database analysis of lipomyelomeningocele cases to identify cases of concomitant CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of posterior fossa volume (based on the Cavalieri principle) was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified cases in which appropriate neuroimages were available, and the results were compared with those obtained in age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven (13%) of 54 patients with lipomyelomeningocele were found to also have CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of these were symptomatic (cervicothoracic syrinx and occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>) and required posterior fossa decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the amount of hindbrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> and the level of the conus medullaris or the type of lipomyelome-ningocele (for example, caudal or transitional) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Volumetric studies of the posterior fossa revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> age-matched volumes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient (who had asymptomatic CM-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CM-I in patients with lipomyelomeningocele appears to be significantly greater than that of the general population and the association rate is too high for the finding to be a chance occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreases in the volume of the posterior cranial fossa were not found in the majority of patients in this small cohort; therefore, the cause of the concomitant occurrence of lipomyelomeningocele and CM-I remains undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should consider obtaining imaging studies of the entire neuraxis in patients with lipomyelomeningoceles and should investigate other causes for syringes found in association with lipomyelomeningoceles </plain></SENT>
