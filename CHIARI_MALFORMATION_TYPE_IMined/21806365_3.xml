<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The natural history of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) is incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report on the outcome of a large group of patients with CM-I that were initially selected for nonsurgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors identified 147 patients in whom CM-I was diagnosed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, who were not offered surgery at the time of diagnosis, and in whom at least 1 year of clinical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging follow-up was available after the initial CM-I diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were included in an outcome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were followed clinically and by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging for a mean duration of 4.6 and 3.8 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 147 patients, 9 had new symptoms attributed to the CM-I during the follow-up interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During this time, development of a spinal cord syrinx occurred in 8 patients; 5 of these patients had a prior diagnosis of a presyrinx state or a dilated central canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous resolution of a syrinx occurred in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple CSF flow studies were obtained in 74 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 23 had improvement in CSF flow, 39 had no change, and 12 showed worsening CSF flow at the foramen magnum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in the mean amount of cerebellar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> over the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients underwent surgical treatment for CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in initial cerebellar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> or CSF flow at the foramen magnum in those who ultimately underwent surgery compared with those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CM-Is that are selected for nonsurgical management, the natural history is usually benign, although spontaneous improvement and worsening are occasionally seen </plain></SENT>
