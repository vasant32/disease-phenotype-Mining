<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is considered to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation</z:e>, although there have been reported cases of an acquired form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We presented a female patient, 45-year old, with ACM I without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> as a rare and unusual clinical image, as well as the effect of decompressive surgery in the treatment of this malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery with clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002078'>truncal ataxia</z:hpo> worsening during the last six years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo> with predominant lower extremity involvement and the signs of the cranial nerves damages occured during the last seven months before admission, with progressive clinical course up to the date of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurosurgical treatment that included suboccipital medial craniectomy with resection of posterior arch C1 vertebrae and C2 laminectomy resulted in a significant clinical improvement and a much better quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Posterior craniovertebral decompression with microsurgical reduction of the cerebellar tonsils and placement of an artificial dural graft is a treatment of choice in severe forms of ACM I without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
