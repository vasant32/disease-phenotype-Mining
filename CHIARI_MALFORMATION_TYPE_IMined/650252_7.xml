<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 underwent air myelogram, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I and postural collapse of the spinal cord was found in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An affected 7-year-old boy was discovered after a clinical and radiological survey of 8 first-degree relatives on the basis of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007256'>pyramidal tract signs</z:hpo> in the lower limbs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005878'>enlarged sagittal diameter of the cervical canal</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One other member had basilar impression of the skull but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No positive correlation was found between either the size of the cystic cord enlargement or descent of the ectopic tonsils with the duration or severity of the neurological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Suboccipital decompressive craniotomy and upper cervical laminectomy in one case was followed by improvement in strength and sensation 1 year later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progression in familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> appears to occur through a mechanism identical to that in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> form and surgery is therefore also indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In affected families, routine survey of close relatives for abnormal neurological signs, and radiological evidence of scoliotic deformity of the spine, enlarged cervical canal and bone abnormalities at the craniovertebral junction may prove valuable for early detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A dominantly inherited, genetically determined malformation seems to be the probable mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> in this family </plain></SENT>
