<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 14-year-old girl with a 1-year history of right facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> induced by sustained leftward head rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These episodes were characterized by weak activation of her right facial muscles with preserved eye opening and closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, she had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001614'>hypernasal speech</z:hpo>, persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, and intermittent left arm <z:mp ids='MP_0005424'>twitching</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A suboccipital craniectomy and C-1 laminectomy were performed for decompression of the CM-I, with duraplasty and coagulation of the pial surface of the cerebellar tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the 9-month follow-up, the patient's inducible hemifacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> had completely resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her symptoms were thought to have resulted from the CM-I, perhaps due to traction on the right facial nerve by the ectopic tonsils with head rotation </plain></SENT>
