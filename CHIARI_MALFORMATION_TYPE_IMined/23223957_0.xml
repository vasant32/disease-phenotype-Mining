<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the rates of neural axis abnormalities in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> patients in a British population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study at two British spinal deformity clinics identified 72 patients satisfying the inclusion criteria of: (1) age at diagnosis of 7 years and younger, (2) idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and (3) magnetic resonance imaging of the neuraxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 3.6 years and the mean Cobb angle was 47° with a near equal distribution of left (32) and right (36) sided curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight (11.1 %) neural axis abnormalities consisting of two syrinxes, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0007099'>Arnold-chiari Type I malformation</z:hpo> and five combined (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold-chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I and syrinx) anomalies were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This multi-centre study on the largest number of British subjects to date helps to establish the rates of neural axis abnormalities </plain></SENT>
