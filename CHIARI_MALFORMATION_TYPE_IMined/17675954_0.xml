<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Syryngomyelia was first described by Olliver in 1824 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burwell and Williams reported a 50% incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Malformations of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> are very difficult to diagnose on the basis of clinical and radiological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI examination is a useful tool in diagnosing neurogenic malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of neurogenic malformations in a group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and the evaluation of shared clinical symptoms in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Material and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical, radiological and MRI assessment was performed on a group of 323 patients referred to the Clinic due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> with a Cobb angle &gt; 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo>, 1 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I and 1 female patient aged 14 was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002144'>tethered cord</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the group, the prevalence of neurogenic malformation was 1.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MRI examination in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> seems to be justified in the following cases: clinical findings suggests a neurogenic background of spine deformation; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before 8 years of age; prior to the planned surgical correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
