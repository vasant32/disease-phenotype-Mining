<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) velocities in the foramen magnum are used to determine the functional significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher peak velocities are found in adult patients with CM-I than in adult control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, it appears that higher CSF velocities are found in pediatric patients with CM-I than in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variations in CSF velocities across age groups in healthy individuals, however, have not been systematically studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 10 pediatric patients after induction of anesthesia to evaluate conditions thought not to affect CSF flow in the foramen magnum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peak systolic and diastolic velocities were plotted with respect to age and compared with velocities obtained in a group of 10 healthy adult volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences between the adult and pediatric groups were tested for significance by using the Student t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peak velocities ranged from 1.9 to 19.9 cm/second in the pediatric group and from 1.2 to 4.5 cm/second in the adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A trend line fitted to the data showed a decrease in velocity with age in the first two decades of life, and little change thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences in the pediatric and adult groups were significant at a level of 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Peak CSF velocities vary significantly with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To determine the normalcy of a CSF flow measurement, it must be compared with age-appropriate normative data </plain></SENT>
