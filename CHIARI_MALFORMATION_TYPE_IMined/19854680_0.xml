<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a novel cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010677'>nocturnal enuresis</z:hpo> (NE) and highlight the literature giving insight into this novel mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: A 12-year-old morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> female with 2-year history of nightly secondary monosymptomatic NE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On evaluation, a history of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037317" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep disturbed</z:e> breathing was elicited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticipating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA), polysomnography was performed, detecting severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0010536'>central sleep apnea</z:hpo> (CSA) without OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM1) with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She had no other classic signs or symptoms of CM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurosurgical decompression halted the NE and normalized nocturnal breathing and cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, confirming that the CSA was caused by the CM1 and resulted in the NE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A thorough literature review found no prior reports of CSA-induced NE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since CSA and OSA differ by the absence of negative intrathoracic pressures in CSA, this case suggests that such pressures are not a key mechanistic component of SA-induced NE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This first report of secondary NE caused by CSA from CM1 emphasizes obtaining a sleep history in the enuretic child, introduces a new cause of NE, and challenges hypotheses underlying SA-induced NE </plain></SENT>
