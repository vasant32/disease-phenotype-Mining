<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that different etiologies have different mechanisms of cerebellar tonsil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> (CTH), as revealed by posterior cranial fossa (PCF) <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 741 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I (CM-I) and 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type II (CM-II), the size of the occipital enchondrium and volume of the PCF (PCFV) were measured on reconstructed 2D-CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements were compared with those in 80 age- and sex-matched healthy control individuals, and the results were correlated with clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant reductions of PCF size and volume were present in 388 patients with classical CM-I, 11 patients with CM-II, and five patients with CM-I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occipital bone size and PCFV were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 225 patients with CM-I and occipitoatlantoaxial joint instability, 55 patients with CM-I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002144'>tethered cord</z:hpo> syndrome (TCS), 30 patients with CM-I and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial mass</z:e> lesions, and 28 patients with CM-I and lumboperitoneal shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had miscellaneous etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The size and area of the foramen magnum were significantly smaller in patients with classical CM-I and CM-I occurring with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and significantly larger in patients with CM-II and CM-I occurring with TCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Important clues concerning the pathogenesis of CTH were provided by morphometric measurements of the PCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When these assessments were correlated with etiological factors, the following causal mechanisms were suggested: (1) cranial constriction; (2) cranial settling; (3) spinal cord tethering; (4) intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; and (5) intraspinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
