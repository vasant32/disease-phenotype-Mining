<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: There is little information about the long-term effectiveness and complications following decompressive surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Examining long-term clinical and radiological follow-up, the authors studied a mixed retrospective and prospective single-institution cohort of 109 consecutive surgically treated adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a standardized surgical protocol: decompression of the craniocervical junction, arachnoid exploration, and shrinkage of the cerebellar tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors predicting outcome were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The retrospective arm consisted of 41 cases treated between 1990 and 1994, and the prospective arm comprised 68 patients treated between 1994 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean overall age was 45.9 years, and 58.8% of the population was female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 12.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent initial symptoms were pain and sensory and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbances</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The comprehensive perioperative complication rate was approximately 11%, with 3 cases (2.7%) of CSF leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis showed that the best combination of clinical and radiological outcome predictors was age and duration of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up confirmed surgical result stability with clinical improvement of greater than 90% of the spinal and cranial manifestations over a long-term period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients had radiological recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> without clinical signs 85 and 124 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Certain clinical predictors of poor clinical and radiological prognosis were identified-namely, age at time of surgery and symptom duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results of the study provide additional long-term data that support the effectiveness and safety of relieving CSF block at the craniocervical junction in CM-I-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
