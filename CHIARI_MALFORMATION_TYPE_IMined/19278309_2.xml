<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The case of a 3-year-old patient with tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and a 13-mm <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I that spontaneously disappeared over the course of 4 years is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using morphometric measurements of the posterior fossa and cerebellum in this patient, the authors show that the volume of the posterior fossa at the time of initial evaluation was consistent with that reported as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the literature (180.24 cm3; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volume 132-198 cm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the patient showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rate of growth of his posterior fossa over the period of observation (201.05 cm3; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range 153-230 cm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar volumes were found to increase only minimally during this time period, which is compatible with observations in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The posterior fossa volume, on the other hand, was shown to increase significantly more than that of the cerebellum (p=0.0185) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This differential growth may permit the tonsils to ascend back up into the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, pediatric patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> posterior fossa volumes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development may have a spontaneous resolution of their asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I </plain></SENT>
