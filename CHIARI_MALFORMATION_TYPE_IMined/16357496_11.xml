<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> type I (CM1) as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">other anomalies</z:e> associated with CM1 remains poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have noted the presence of elevated CSF pressures with small ventricles, consistent with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e> (PTC) syndrome in a group of CM1 patients that did not respond over the long term to posterior fossa decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to better understand this association, we reviewed a series of CM1 patients treated by posterior fossa decompression to define the prevalence and nature of post-Chiari PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 192 patients diagnosed with CM1 and treated by posterior fossa decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who failed to respond to surgery were evaluated by CINE <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> flow studies to assess presence of CSF flow at the foramen magnum and then by lumbar puncture if flow was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of Chiari PTC was defined by recurrence of Chiari-like symptoms after decompression, elevated lumbar CSF pressure in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo>, and transient resolution of symptoms with large volume lumbar CSF drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six of 192 patients did not improve with surgical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 36 operative CM1 patients (41.6%) were found to have Chiari PTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent symptoms of CM1/PTC patients were head pain, body aches, and balance difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients also experienced visual complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean maximum lumbar CSF pressure documented in this cohort was 26 cm of water in adults and 25.3 in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received treatment for the CM1/PTC that culminated with CSF shunt placement in 14/15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven of 9 pediatric patients had significant symptom resolution while 6/6 adult patients remained variably symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CM1 and PTC co-exist in a surprising percentage of failed operative CM1 patients and present with a syndrome that is difficult to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The etiology of this association after Chiari decompression is unclear, though perhaps posterior fossa surgery in the setting of abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and potentially anomalous CSF flow dynamics contributes to CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> and resultant or coexistant PTC </plain></SENT>
