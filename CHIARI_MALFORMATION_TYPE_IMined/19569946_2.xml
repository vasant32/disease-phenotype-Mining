<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonautologous dural grafts have been associated with numerous complications including <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, bacteria and virus transmission, fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</z:e> transmission, foreign body reaction, systemic immune response, excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo>, slower healing, premature graft dissolution, and wound dehiscence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autogenous tissues have the advantage of being nonimmunogenic, nontoxic, readily available, and inexpensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pericranium is a preferred substrate because it is flexible, strong, and easily sutured for a watertight closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current literature supports the use of autogenous pericranium for dural grafting in CM-I procedures, but has heretofore failed to provide a method of harvest that avoids the complications associated with a larger exposure or second incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors offer a simple alternative technique for using local pericranium in duraplasty for CM-I or other posterior fossa abnormalities </plain></SENT>
