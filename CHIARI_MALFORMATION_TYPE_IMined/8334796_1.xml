<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 38-year-old woman complained for about 5 years of attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> elicited by coughing, sneezing, and laughing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These attacks became more frequent and more severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physical examination showed a short and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000475'>broad neck</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed no abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> (type I) and the cerebral venous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> in left frontal white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A posterior decompression by suboccipital craniectomy with C1 laminectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> completely disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before and after the operation, we measured the intracranial subdural pressure by a small pressure transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The raised cranial pressure by the Valsalva's maneuver prolonged for more than one minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the raised cranial pressure by the Valsalva's maneuver decreased rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We consider that the cough <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of this patient was associated with a valve-like blockage by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> (type I) at the foramen magunum, resulting in cranio-spinal pressure dissociation by interference with downward pulsation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We believe that there was no correlation between the cough <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and the cerebral venous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
