<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Noncommunicating canalicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> occurs in up to 65% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> is poorly understood and treatment is not always effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it is generally thought that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> is simply an accumulation of CSF from the subarachnoid space, the pathogenesis is likely to be more complex and may involve cellular and molecular processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) has been implicated in numerous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> pathological conditions involving <z:mpath ids='MPATH_106'>fluid accumulation</z:mpath>, including spinal cord <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that AQP4 facilitates the removal of extracellular water following vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate AQP4 expression and the structural and functional integrity of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) in a model of noncommunicating canalicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A kaolin-induced model of canalicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> was used to investigate BSCB permeability and AQP4 expression in 27 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Control groups consisted of nonoperated, laminectomy-only, and saline-injected animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The structural integrity of the BSCB was assessed using immunoreactivity to endothelial barrier antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional integrity of the BSCB was assessed by extravasation of systemically injected horseradish peroxidase (HRP) at 1, 3, 6, or 12 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence was used to assess AQP4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression at 12 weeks following syrinx induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Extravasation of HRP was evident surrounding the central canal in 11 of 15 animals injected with kaolin, and in 2 of the 5 sham-injected animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No disruption of the BSCB was observed in laminectomy-only controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At 12 weeks the tracer leakage was widespread, occurring at every level rostral to the kaolin injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At this time point there was a decrease in EBA expression in the gray matter surrounding the central canal from C-5 to C-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Aquaporin-4 was expressed in gray- and white-matter astrocytes, predominantly at the glia limitans interna and externa, and to a lesser extent around neurons and blood vessels, in both control and syrinx animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Expression of GFAP and APQ4 directly surrounding the central canal in kaolin-injected animals was variable and not significantly different from expression in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a prolonged disruption of the BSCB directly surrounding the central canal in the experimental model of noncommunicating canalicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The disruption was widespread at 12 weeks, when central canal dilation was most marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Loss of integrity of the barrier with fluid entering the interstitial space of the spinal parenchyma may contribute to enlargement of the canal and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Significant changes in AQP4 expression were not observed in this model of canalicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is needed to elucidate whether subtle changes in AQP4 expression occur in canalicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
