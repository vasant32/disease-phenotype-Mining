<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Distances and angles between skull base landmarks were measured on preoperative magnetic resonance images obtained in 30 children (age range 36-204 months) with symptomatic isolated CM-I; 16 of them (53%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made with 42 children of similar age who comprised the control group by using one-way analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The angle formed by the crista galli (CG), dorsum sellae (DS), and foramen magnum (FM) was larger than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in individuals with CM-I than in those without (145 degrees in patients with CM-I but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and 151 degrees in those with CM-I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> compared with 135 degrees in controls; p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The angle formed by the left internal auditory meatus (IAM), FM, and right IAM was also larger than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the patients (122 degrees in patients with CM-I but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and 123 degrees in those with CM-I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> compared with 110 degrees in controls; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The angle formed by the anterior clinoid process (<z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>), CG, and right <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> was smaller than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (29 degrees in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with CM-I compared with 34 degrees in controls; p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distance between the two IAMs was longer than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (75 mm in patients with CM-I but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and 63 mm in those with CM-I and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> compared with 58 mm in controls; p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distance between the two <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACPs</z:chebi> was shorter than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> group (31 mm in patients with CM-I but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> and 27 mm in those with CM-I and syrinx compared with 32 mm in controls; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the group of patients with CM-I, the DS-FM and left <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>-right <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> distances were smaller in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> group (p = 0.009 and p = 0.037, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Children with CM-I have abnormal geometrical measurements of their entire skull base, not only the posterior fossa, irrespective of presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may indicate a mesodermal defect as a possible cause of the malformation </plain></SENT>
