<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors present their surgical experience of over 2 decades of treating children with this form of hindbrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of their institutional experience with the surgical treatment of the pediatric CM-I from 1989 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 2 most common presentations were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>/neck pain (40%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Common associated diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> Type 1 (5%) and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000824'>growth hormone deficiency</z:hpo> (4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spine anomalies included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> (18%), retroversion of the odontoid process (24%), Klippel-Feil anomaly (3%), and atlantooccipital fusion (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 3% of patients had a known family member with CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>Hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was present in 48 patients (9.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>Syringomyelia</z:hpo> was present in 285 patients (57%), and at operation, 12% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> were found to have an arachnoid veil occluding the fourth ventricular outlet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (3%) have undergone reoperation for continued symptoms or persistent large <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most likely symptoms and signs to resolve following surgery were Valsalva-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average hospital stay and "return to school" time were 3 and 12 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The follow-up for this group ranged from 2 months to 15 years (mean 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 2.4% of cases; there was no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No patient required <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> return to the operating room, and no blood transfusions were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe this to be the largest reported series of surgically treated pediatric CM-I patients and hope that their experience will be of use to others who treat this surgical entity </plain></SENT>
