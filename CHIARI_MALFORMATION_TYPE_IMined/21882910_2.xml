<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid flow can be visualized using dynamic phase-contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because there is only a paucity of studies evaluating CSF dynamics in the region of the spinal canal on the basis of preoperative and postoperative measurements, the authors investigated the clinical usefulness of cardiacgated phase-contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in patients with CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety patients with CM-I underwent preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of CSF pulsation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>Syringomyelia</z:hpo> was present in 59 patients and absent in 31 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phase-contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the entire <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> was used to investigate 22 patients with CM-I before surgery and after a mean postoperative period of 12 months (median 12 months, range 3-33 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the dynamic studies, absolute flow velocities, the extension of the syrinx, and tonsillar descent were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The changes in pulsation were highly significant in the region of the (enlarged) cistern (p = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maximum and minimum velocities (the pulsation amplitude) increased considerably in the region where the syrinx was largest in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The changes of pulsation in these patients were significant in the subarachnoid space in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> spinal segments but not in the syrinx itself and in the central canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration of CSF flow pulsation can contribute to assessments of surgical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results presented here, however, raise doubts about current theories on the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
