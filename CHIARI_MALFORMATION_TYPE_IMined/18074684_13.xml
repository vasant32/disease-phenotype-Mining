<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> Type I (CM-I) is generally regarded as a disorder of the paraxial mesoderm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report an association between CM-I and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disorders</z:e> of connective tissue (HDCT) that can present with lower brainstem symptoms attributable to occipitoatlantoaxial hypermobility and cranial settling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prevalence of HDCT was determined in a prospectively accrued cohort of 2813 patients with CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a detailed medical and neuroradiological workup that included an assessment of articular mobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Osseous structures composing the craniocervical junction were investigated morphometrically using reconstructed 3D computed tomography and plain x-ray images in 114 patients with HDCT/CM-I, and the results were compared with those obtained in patients with CM-I (55 cases) and healthy control individuals (55 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> and related HDCT were met in 357 (12.7%) of the 2813 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hereditability was generally compatible with a pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> transmission with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable expressivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic features of HDCT/CM-I were distinguished from those of CM-I by clinical stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e>, a greater female preponderance (8:1 compared with 3:1, p &lt; 0.001), and a greater incidence of lower brainstem symptoms (0.41 compared with 0.11, p &lt; 0.001), retroodontoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155094,C0333350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">pannus</z:e> formation (0.71 compared with 0.11, p &lt; 0.001), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the oropharynx (0.44 compared with 0.02, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the basion-dens interval, basion-atlas interval, atlas-dens interval, dens-atlas interval, clivus-atlas angle, clivus-axis angle, and atlas-axis angle were the same in the supine and upright positions in healthy control individuals and patients with CM-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with HDCT/CM-I, there was a reduction of the basion-dens interval (3.6 mm, p &lt; 0.001), an enlargement of the basion-atlas interval (3.0 mm, p &lt; 0.001), and a reduction of the clivus-axis angle (10.8 degrees, p &lt; 0.001), clivus-atlas angle (5.8 degrees, p &lt; 0.001), and atlas-axis angle (5.3 degrees, p &lt; 0.001) on assumption of the upright position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These changes were reducible by cervical traction or returning to the supine position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The identification of HDCT in 357 patients with CM-I establishes an association between two presumably unrelated mesodermal disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Morphometric evidence in this cohort-cranial settling, posterior gliding of the occipital condyles, and reduction of the clivus-axis angle, clivus-atlas angle, and atlas-axis angle in the upright position-suggests that hypermobility of the occipitoatlantal and atlantoaxial joints contributes to retroodontoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155094,C0333350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">pannus</z:e> formation and symptoms referable to basilar impression </plain></SENT>
