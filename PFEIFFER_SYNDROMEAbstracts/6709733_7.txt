A prospective review is presented of 50 patients with one of the craniofacial synostosis syndromes who underwent early interventive craniofacial surgical correction (average age 7.6 months at time of surgery). The study has demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the techniques when employed in the infant. Satisfactory cranio-orbital form was achieved in the majority of the patients, although 10 patients required secondary surgery because of sutural refusion or the development of turricephaly or calvarial contour irregularities. Despite earlier hopes, this surgery did not result in the development of satisfactory occlusal relationships and midfacial form in the craniofacial dysostosis group (Crouzon's, Apert's, etc.). Based on this clinical experience, a surgical treatment plan is presented for the newborn with craniofacial synostosis.
