There is virtually no literature on the effect of correction of syndromal faciocraniosynostosis with monobloc advancement on the palpebral fissure shape. Using image processing software, we measured the effect of monobloc advancement on the position of the upper and lower eyelids as well as the palpebral fissure slant in a series of 18 patients with syndromal faciocraniosynostosis who had undergone surgery for correction of orbital and midface hypoplasia. For both eyes of each patient, 3 variables were measured on the pre- and postoperative photographs: the linear distances between the upper and lower eyelid margins, the pupil center and the angle between the inner and outer canthi. The globe protrusion was also measured on axial computed tomography scans before and after surgery. The results indicate that the exorbitism reduction induced by monobloc advancement is accompanied by a diminution of the distance between both eyelids and the pupil center. However, the downward slant of the palpebral fissure is increased after surgery. The data suggest that the lower and upper eyelid retraction seen preoperatively in the majority of patients with faciocraniosynostosis tend to be corrected when the frontofacial region is advanced by the monobloc. On the other hand, the surgery tends to lower the outer canthus, increasing the negative slant of the fissure. The postoperative changes induced by the frontofacial monobloc advancement need to be taken into account when the surgery is going to be performed.
