The aim of this article was to describe the achievement and the clinical use of a new three-dimensional surgical guide for frontal-nasal-ethmoid-vomer osteotomy. The three-dimensional guide is based on a three-dimensional rapid prototyping model and provides the three-dimensional spatial orientation and depth for the frontonasal osteotome. The method was applied to a 7-year-old patient with Apert syndrome. This technique allowed a critical osteotomy path in Le Fort III surgery to be transferred in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way from the three-dimensional rapid prototyping model to the operating room.
