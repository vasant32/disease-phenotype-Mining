We report on a patient with a unique constellation of anomalies comprising trigonomicrocephaly, asymmetric severe micrognathia, large ears, atrioventricular septal defect, vertebral anomalies, bilateral cutaneous syndactyly of fingers and toes, unilateral cryptorchidism and multiple café-au-lait spots. The mother of the propositus has multiple café-au-lait spots. Search of POSSUM and the London Dysmorphology Database (LDDB) uncovered no similar case. We think that this patient represents a new acrocraniofacial dysostosis syndrome.
