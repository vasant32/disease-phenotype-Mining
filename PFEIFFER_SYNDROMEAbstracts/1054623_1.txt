Three NIDR-sponsored workshops were conducted with the goal of identifying research needs in treatment and basic sciences relating to a group of severe craniofacial anomalies that are now correctable by new radical surgical procedures. Experts in the fields of developmental biology, neurosurgery and reconstructive craniofacial surgery discussed areas of investigation dealing with etiology, prevention and treatment that are most likely to result in clincally-useful information. In addition the establishment of craniofacial anomalies centers for data collection, treatment and research was examined.
