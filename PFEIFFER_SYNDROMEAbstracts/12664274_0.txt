We present the case of a 7-year-old child with Aspert's syndrome who was diagnosed as suffering from childhood autism. As far as we are aware this is the first described association between autism and acrocephalosyndactyly syndromes. We discuss issues regarding the diagnosis and co-morbidity of the autistic spectrum disorders.
