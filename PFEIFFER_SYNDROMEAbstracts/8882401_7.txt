The acrocephalosyndactyly syndromes (ACS) are a group of clinically similar disorders that share the manifestations of craniosynostosis and a variety of hand and foot anomalies. Here we report on a 5-generation kindred segregating sagittal craniosynostosis and syndactyly of the fingers and the toes in an autosomal dominant manner. The anomalies seen in this kindred comprise a syndrome distinct from other craniosynostosis syndromes. For this novel syndrome, we propose the name craniosynostosis, Philadelphia type.
