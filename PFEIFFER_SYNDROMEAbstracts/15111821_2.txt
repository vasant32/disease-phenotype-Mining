The use of bioabsorbable plating systems for rigid fixation after cranial remodeling surgery has become the standard of care in the treatment of syndromic and nonsyndromic craniosynostoses at pediatric craniofacial centers in North America. The advantages of these absorbable plating systems over metallic plates and screws have been well documented. The absorbable plates have been used with remarkable safety and efficacy for more than 15 years. An unusual case of repeated early failure of an absorbable plating system in a patient with syndromic brachycephaly complicated by the development of hydrocephalus is reported. The reoperative rates for cranial remodeling surgery at our institution and the possible causes for this failure are discussed.
