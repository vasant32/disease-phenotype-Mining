OBJECTIVE: Children with a severe craniofacial anomaly are at risk for emotional and behavioural problems. Do children with Apert syndrome present with a special psychological profile? METHOD: Parent reports (Child Behaviour Checklist) were obtained from 25 children with Apert syndrome. RESULTS: Fourteen children were characterized by clinically significant social problems, 10 by attentional problems, nine by social withdrawal. Total CBCL-scores were in the clinical range for eight children. CONCLUSION: Information on psychosocial state should be included in regular check-ups of children with a severe craniofacial anomaly in order to identify children who are in need of psychological interventions.
