 OBJECTIVE: Correction of craniofacial dysostosis with midface distraction osteotogenesis. METHODS: Le Fort III osteotomy has been employed through coronal route on patients with midface craniofacial dysostosis such as Crouzon and Apert syndrome. Then a REDII distraction device was set up, and the device bars directed. The distraction begins 6.4 days after the surgery, with a rate of 1 mm per day. When midface approaching the right position, i.e. an slightly over correction of occlusion is reached, the distraction stops and the device is held for the next 2-4 months. RESULTS: There are 8 cases completed all the therapy with an average age of 11.9 years old. The midface had been moved averagely 9.7 mm forwards and 1.6 mm downwards. The features had been improved obviously and the occlusions reach nearly normal. The exophthalmos reduced from 20.3 mm to 11.9 mm. In cephalometry, SNA was averagely enlarged 9 degrees, and ANB enlarged 8.8 degrees. The snore during sleeping was also improved in 87.5% cases. No serious complication had occurred except minor one such as 1 case of seroma and 1 case of infection around pin on scalp. According to 5 months averagely follow-up, there is no recurrence in our list. CONCLUSIONS: Midface distraction osteotogenesis is propitious to teenage or severe cases of craniofacial dysostosis.
