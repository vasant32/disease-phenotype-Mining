 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of distraction osteogenesis on correction of craniofacial dysostosis. METHODS: Le Fort III osteotomy was applied through coronal route on patients with craniofacial dysostosis such as Crouzon and Apert syndrome. The procedures included disconnecting the skeletal midface from base of cranium, setting up a RED II distraction device, and directing the device bars. The distraction was started 5 days after the surgery, with a rate of 1 mm forward per day. When midface approaching the right position, i.e. a slightly over correction of occlusion was reached, stopped distraction and kept the device for 2 - 4 months. RESULTS: Eight cases completed all the therapy. The average blood lose was 300 ml and the average operation time was 3.5 hours. The midface had been moved averagely 9 mm forwardly and 1.5 mm downwards. The features had been improved obviously and the occlusion reached nearly normal. No serious complications occurred except for 1 case of seroma and 1 case of infection around pin on scalp. No recurrence was found in the 5 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Midface distraction osteogenesis is propitious to teenage or severe cases of craniofacial dysostosis.
