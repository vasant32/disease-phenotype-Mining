Patients with Apert's syndrome usually have severe complex syndactyly affecting both hands. Surgical separation of the distal digital bony fusion often exposes bone and cartilage which can cause problems with graft take. A case is presented where the bare divided bone between two digits was kept apart with a silastic sheet. On its removal 4 weeks later, the previously bare bone was covered with a membrane. This was covered with a full thickness skin graft with a complete graft take.
