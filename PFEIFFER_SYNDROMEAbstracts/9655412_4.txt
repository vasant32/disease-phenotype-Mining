Distraction osteogenesis was used to correct congenital hand deformities in 12 digits. The patients' ages at the time of distraction ranged between 2.5 and 7 years. A total of nine patients underwent lengthening of 12 bones. The average period of distraction was 31.1 +/- 17.6 days. The average length of distraction was 23.6 +/- 7.3 mm. Seventeen percent of the patients after lengthening had an angular deformity that required remodeling of the regenerate. No infections were noted. Distraction osteogenesis provides a useful tool for reliable and predictable correction of osseous defects with vascular bone in patients with congenital anomalies of the hand.
