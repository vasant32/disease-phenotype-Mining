Size, proportions, level, inclination and shape of the ears were assessed by anthrompometric methods in eight patients with Treacher Collins' syndrome, eleven with Apert's, and 25 with Crouzon's syndrome. The ears were most severely damaged in Treacher Collins' syndrome, in which they were microtic or disproportionally long; many were low-set and with great inclination. All patients with Apert's syndrome had low-set ears and a tendency to disproportion, with widening and small inclination of the longitudinal axis. The ears were least affected in Crouzon's syndrome; in two-thirds of the patients there were mild growth variations leading to disproportion in width (wide ears), or low-set ears, or both.
