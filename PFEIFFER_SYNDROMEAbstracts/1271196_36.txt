An unusual spectrum of craniofacial and foot abnormalities has been detected within a large midwestern Amish kindred. Enlarged great toes and craniofacial abnormalities suggested Pfeiffer acrocephalosynadactyly type V; however, thumb abnormalities were not present. Eighty-eight affected individuals were observed and another 50 were reliably reported to be affected. An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern was observed associated with variable expressivity. All affected individuals had some clinical or radiologic abnormality of the feet. The phenotypic expression was so variable that the entire spectrum of dominantly inherited craniofacial dysotoses-acrocephalosyndactylys (except the typical Apert syndrome) was seen within this kindred.
