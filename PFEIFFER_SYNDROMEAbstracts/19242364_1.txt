 BACKGROUND: Previously, we have reported the pattern of temperature increase after transcranial surgery for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. It was found that pyrexia had a bimodal distribution during the first 48 hours after surgery. AIM: The aims of this study were to evaluate pyrexia after transcranial surgery for syndromic craniosynostosis (Pfeiffer syndrome), to investigate whether the same pattern occurred, and to evaluate the correlation between pyrexia and possible factors, that is, sex, age, procedure, length of surgery, and incidence of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. METHOD: Twenty-one sequential case notes of Pfeiffer syndrome were retrospectively reviewed to collect 38 postoperative temperature courses. The mean change of temperature was plotted on a graph with a trend line to find the feature of the course. RESULTS: Pyrexia after transcranial surgery for Pfeiffer syndrome had a bimodal distribution during the first 48 hours, similar to the pyrexia after transcranial surgery for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. This pyrexia was higher and more prolonged in those undergoing a longer surgical procedure and frontofacial advancement and procedures accompanied with postoperative CSF leakage. Moreover, the temperature course was more complex in procedures accompanied with postoperative CSF leakage. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that in Pfeiffer syndrome, which has more complicated pathologic status than nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, also had bimodal postoperative temperature course. Although the etiology of the bimodal pyrexia remains unclear, it seems that it is part of the normal postoperative course in these cases. However, prolonged raised temperature within the first 48 postoperative hours may suggest a complication.
