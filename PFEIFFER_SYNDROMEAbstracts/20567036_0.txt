This case report describes the combined orthodontic and orthognathic management of a 14-year-old girl affected with Apert syndrome. She presented with a severe Class III skeletal relationship, midfacial hypoplasia and an large anterior open bite. Intraorally, she had severe crowding, a narrow maxilla and lateral posterior crossbites. The patient was treated with a combination of removable and fixed appliances, a transpalatal skeletal distractor and Le Fort I surgery. The extraoral characteristics improved and a good occlusal relationship between maxillary and mandibular teeth was achieved.
