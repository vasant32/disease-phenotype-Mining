Patients with Apert syndrome commonly present with ocular proptosis due to bilateral coronal craniosynostosis and midfacial hypoplasia. Severe proptosis can cause visual compromise and damage, which is most commonly treated with bilateral orbital frontal advancement. The authors present the case of a patient who was treated at 8 weeks of age with endoscope-assisted bilateral coronal craniectomies followed by treatment with a custom-made postoperative cranial orthosis. The patient underwent the procedure without any complications. Over the ensuing months, the patient's proptosis corrected, the forehead and orbital rims advanced without the need for an orbital frontal advancement and craniotomies. This approach may provide an alternative treatment modality for these patients.
