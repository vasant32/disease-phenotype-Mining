A new head position for use during operation on young children with cranial deformities is described. The position allows exposure of the entire calvarium from the supraorbital ridges to the posterior rim of the foramen magnum. It is a modification of the conventional prone position involving hyperextension of the neck. The authors have safely used this position to perform one-stage radical cranial remodeling procedures that previously required two stages. The advantages of this position and the methods for achieving it are discussed.
