Since few data on the reproductive outlook of patients successfully treated for lymphoproliferative disease are available, further experiences on the pregnancy outcome and offspring follow-up of 12 women treated for acute lymphoid leukemia and 7 women treated for malignant lymphoma are reported. Of the 20 pregnancies of leukemic patients in remission, 14 ended in live births, one in spontaneous abortion, and 5 in elective abortions among which one was performed during relapse. One minor (hip dysplasia) and one major birth defect (Apert syndrome) were seen. The Apert syndrome baby is considered as a new mutation. Of the 9 pregnancies of lymphoma patients 5 ended in normal births and 4 in elective abortions. Neither relapse nor malformation was encountered. One leukemic patient had gestational edema and one lymphoma patient had puerperal thrombophlebitis of lower extremity. The offspring of the above patients appropriately developed and had no complication except for one with cephalhematoma and for another one with epilepsy attributed to birth injury.
