Three cases of acrocephalosyndactyly with duplication of the first toe and presence of six well-individualized metatarsals are reported. This type of polysyndactyly should suggest the diagnosis of Carpenter syndrome, which is inherited on a recessive autosomal basis. However, in the three patients reported here, the facial dysmorphism was distinct from that seen in Carpenter syndrome and the syndactyly was more marked. The correct diagnosis therefore seems to be Apert acrocephalosyndactyly, a disease with dominant transmission. A mutation seems very likely and consequently the risk of recurrence in siblings is probably minimal.
