Maxillary osteotomies are done to correct discrepancies in structural facial harmony. The deformities involve retrusion or protrusion, as well as pathological shortening and elongation of the maxilla. Surgical orthopedics of the maxilla move the nose in part, or in whole, in relationship to the rest of the face. Corrective rhinoplasty is sometimes necessary to correct esthetic discrepancies thus produced, as well as other deformities that may be the usual concomitant of the syndrome addressed by the facial surgery. Le Fort I osteotomies produce more marked changes than pyramidal or Le Fort III type osteotomies, specifically as the tip relates to the dorsum. Segmental osteotomies done to correct discrepancies in vertical height of the maxilla produce specific alterations in the tip-lip relationship.
