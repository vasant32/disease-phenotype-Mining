Apert's syndrome is a developmental malformation characterized by: craniosynostosis, a cone-shaped calvarium, midface hypoplasia, pharyngeal attenuation, ocular manifestations, and syndactyly of the hands and feet. The prodromal characteristic for the typical craniofacial appearance is early craniosynostosis of the coronal suture, the cranial base, and an agenesis of the sagittal suture. These craniofacial characteristics predispose the patient to maxillary transverse and sagittal hypoplasia with concomitant dental crowding, a maxillary pseudocleft palate, and a skeletal and dental anterior open bite. This is a case report of an Apert's syndrome patient with a discussion of the orthodontic and dentofacial orthopedic considerations that influenced the treatment plan.
