A genetically remarkable case of the Vogt syndrome (combination of the Apert and Crouzon syndromes) associated with a dysraphia syndrome is described. Clinically, malformations corresponding to the Apert syndrome were prominent, and radiological examination of the skull revealed a prominent Crouzon syndrome. Investigation of the familial background revealed the presence of malformations in other members of the family, such as malformation of the extremities and acrocephalus. On the other hand, the father's age of 63 years was considerably higher than that of fathers in the average population, so that the possibility of a new mutation had to be considered. The fact that the mother suffered an attack of influenza during pregnancy, finally, brought the possibility of peristatic influences being involved in the complex malformations.
