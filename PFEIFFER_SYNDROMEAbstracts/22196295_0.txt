 PURPOSE: To demonstrate the utility of computed tomography angiographic planning of a single-stage, complete release of syndactyly in Apert syndrome. METHODS: Computed tomography angiograms were performed as a preoperative planning tool in 6 patients. Five came to surgery. All had a single-stage operation for complete release of their syndactyly. RESULTS: Five patients, ranging from Upton type 1 to type 3 Apert hand deformities, have had preoperative computed tomography angiography that delineated the vascular anatomy. This allowed planning and execution of a single-stage syndactyly release in all patients. The preoperative imaging identified noteworthy abnormalities in vascular anatomy that were incorporated into surgical planning. CONCLUSIONS: The protocol presented allows preoperative planning and single-stage operation for complete release of syndactyly in patients with Apert syndrome.
