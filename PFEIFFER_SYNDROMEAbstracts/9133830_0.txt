The histologic findings from sutural specimens remove during early cranial surgery in Apert's syndrome infants have been reviewed. Coronal sutures are uniformly fused histologically in their inferolateral extent, showing a progression to lesser changes at the superior margin. These findings correspond with radiographic changes. The lambdoid sutures occasionally show histologic evidence of fusion, with the same pattern of inferior to superior progression, but a lack of objective radiographic changes.
