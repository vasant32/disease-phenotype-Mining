Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is characterized primarily by facial and digital anomalies. This case report describes multiple dental anomalies in a patient with Saethre-Chotzen, not reported in previous descriptions of the syndrome. These features are teeth with broad, bulbous crowns, thin, narrow tapering roots, and diffuse pulp stones in the pulp chambers of all posterior teeth. These dental findings, along with being associated with the syndrome, may influence dental care for these patients.
