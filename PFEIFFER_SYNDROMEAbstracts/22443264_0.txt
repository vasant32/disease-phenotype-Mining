Apert syndrome (Acrocephalosyndactyly type I; AS) is a rare but well-known autosomal dominant disorder characterized by craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, bony/cutaneous syndactyly of fingers and toes as well as a variety of associated congenital anomalies involving the brain, heart, limbs and other organ systems. We report the case of a fetus with molecularly confirmed Apert syndrome and additional fusion of the thalamic nuclei. Various central nervous system anomalies, have been reported in patients with AS. However, as far as we know cases of fused thalami in Apert syndrome have never been reported so far.
