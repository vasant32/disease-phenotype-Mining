Purpose :  Dental agenesis is the most common anomaly of dental development and can be a component of a congenital syndrome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of agenesis and to describe patterns of tooth agenesis in patients with Crouzon or Apert syndrome compared with nonsyndromic controls. Patients and Methods :  Longitudinal records of 67 patients with Crouzon syndrome (n = 39) or Apert syndrome (n = 28) from the Erasmus Medical Centre were examined. Syndromic patients were compared with patients in a nonsyndromic control group (n = 284). Results :  Prevalence of tooth agenesis in patients with Crouzon syndrome (35.9%) and patients with Apert syndrome (46.4%) was significantly higher than the prevalence in control subjects (27.5%) (P < .005). In all groups third molars were the most likely to be agenetic. Tooth agenesis excluding third molars was significantly higher in syndromic patients than in control subjects (P < .001). Bilateral agenesis of mandibular second premolars occurred significantly more often in patients with Crouzon and Apert syndrome than in control subjects (P < .001). Conclusions :  Tooth agenesis is more prevalent in patients with Crouzon or Apert syndrome than in control subjects. Tooth agenesis and mandibular symmetrical patterns of second premolar agenesis are more prevalent in syndromic patients.
