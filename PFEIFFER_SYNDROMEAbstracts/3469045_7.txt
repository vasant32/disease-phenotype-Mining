Our report deals with 8 patients with Crouzon's and Apert's syndromes followed longitudinally with roentgencephalometric examinations during the growth period. The purpose of the study was to analyze: presurgical facial growth, the displacement of the maxillary complex in connection with Le Fort III advancement, the stability of the surgical result, and postsurgical facial growth. Presurgical facial growth was characterized by lack of maxillary sutural growth and abnormal remodeling of the maxilla. The surgical displacement of the maxilla consisted of an average advancement of about 10 mm and a backward rotation. The maxilla remained stable following surgery. However, onlay bone grafts tended to resorb over the long term. Postsurgical facial growth revealed lack of maxillary displacement with development of exophthalmos, relative mandibular prognathism, and malocclusion. However, it was concluded that the positive effects of early craniofacial surgery in patients with severe forms of Crouzon's and Apert's syndromes outweigh these disadvantages.
