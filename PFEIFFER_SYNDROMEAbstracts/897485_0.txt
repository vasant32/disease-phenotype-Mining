Computed tomography is an important diagnostic procedure in evaluation of the pediatric patient with an abnormal cranial size and (or) shape. Differential diagnosis of cranial abnormalities based on two hundred and thirty-one computed tomograms is presented. It allows accurate assessment of ventricular size, cerebrospinal fluid pathways, brain substance, and calvarium. Frequently the abnormality demonstrated is so specific that an etiologic diagnosis is made.
