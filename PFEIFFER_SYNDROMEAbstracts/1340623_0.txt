The correction of cranial and limb malformations of the Apert's syndrome requires efforts of a multidisciplinary team. The esthetic and functional repercussions that this syndrome brings to their carriers are severe and so the treatment should aim tom improve the function of the hands in order to integrate these patients in a more normal social live. In our Service, in the period from 1989 to 1992 five patients carrying this syndrome had their hand correction completed before the age of three years. It was observed that surgery was possible in this early stage with no additional complication rate. Quadrangular flaps for the neocomissure and for the coverage of the fingers were successfully used even with skeletal deviations. There was improvement of the esthetics of the hands, but their function could not be evaluated properly. Anyway, because of complex abnormalities the results will never be perfect. The early treatment of these alterations allows the gain of a better hand function and moreover accelerates the physical and intellectual development of the children.
