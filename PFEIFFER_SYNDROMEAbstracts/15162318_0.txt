In patients with Apert syndrome, the hands demonstrate many disturbances of soft tissue and bony structures. These include a short thumb with radial clinodactyly, complex syndactyly with a bony fusion involving the index, long and ring fingers, symphalangism and simple syndactyly of the fourth web space. The soft tissue anomalies involve the intrinsic muscles, the extrinsic tendon insertions and the neurovascular bundles. We have reviewed 52 patients who underwent surgical reconstruction of their hands. The aim of this study is to propose a better surgical management in the light of recent publications and to improve our understanding of the syndrome, attempting to reduce the number of procedures and to select the best possible procedures for each patient.
