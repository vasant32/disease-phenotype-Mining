A new tool for the study of biological form change is applied in a comparison of craniofacial growth in normal children and those affected with Apert syndrome. Using finite-element scaling analysis, the magnitude of size change during postnatal growth in the Apert sample was determined to be generally less than normal, and the magnitude of shape change was generally greater than normal. No consistent, statistically significant, alteration from normal growth was defined in the Apert sample, however. There appears to be no consistent effect on general cell and tissue proliferation in Apert syndrome. Rather, specific subpopulations of cells and tissues may be affected differentially over time.
