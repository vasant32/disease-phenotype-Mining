Stiffness of the interphalangeal joints of the fingers is a constant feature of Apert's syndrome. Because of this stiffness, the author has used split-thickness skin grafts when correcting Apert's syndactyly, thinking that contraction of such grafts post-operatively would not cause any joint contracture or finger deviation. This paper reports the results of eight patients whose average age at first surgery was 6 months. Separation of all digits was accomplished before the age of 2 years. A dorsal rectangular flap and interposing triangular digital flaps were utilised to create the web space and partially cover the skin defects in the fingers. The remaining digital defects were covered with thin split-thickness skin grafts which took fully in all cases. At final follow-up (1-6 years), the areas covered by skin grafts have reduced in size significantly because of skin graft contraction. However, this did not result joint contracture or digital deviation.
