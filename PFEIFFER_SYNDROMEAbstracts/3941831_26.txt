Children with severe craniofacial anomalies and breathing problems are rare, and the accumulated experience of their treatment is limited. LeFort III midface advancements have been tried by many craniofacial teams, but no consensus has yet been reached as to the effectiveness of this procedure. In this report of seven patients with craniofacial malformations and severe breathing problems, three had a LeFort II midface advancement, one had release of bilateral temporomandibular joint ankylosis, and two had tonsillectomies. Two patients without a tracheostomy suffocated, four had a long-term tracheostomy, and one was cured by a unilateral tonsillectomy. It was concluded that LeFort III midface advancement is ineffective in these types of cases without a very stable postoperative retention, and it was suggested that all patients with severe craniofacial anomalies and breathing problems, regardless of their planned subsequent treatment, should have a tracheostomy as an initial measure.
