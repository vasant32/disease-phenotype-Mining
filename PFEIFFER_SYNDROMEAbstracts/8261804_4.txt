Apert's syndrome, also known as acrocephalosyndactyly, is a rare type of premature craniofacial synostosis characterized by the clinical triad of cranial and facial malformations along with syndactyly of the hands and feet. Acne vulgaris involving atypical sites such as the upper extremities constitutes the dermatologic hallmark of this rare genodermatosis. We report a patient who demonstrates the classic findings of Apert's syndrome. Our patient also presented with severe hyperhidrosis, which may represent a new clinical finding not previously reported in association with this syndrome.
