We report a 2-year-old girl with craniosynostosis, an ossification defect of the cranial vault, midface hypoplasia, low frontal hairline, anti-mongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures, ptosis of the lateral upper lids and high-arched narrow palate. There are additional findings fitting the Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome, such as hypoplasia of the labia majora, hypoplasia of the distal phalanges of fingers and toes and conductive hearing loss, but hypertrichosis and dental anomalies are missing, which were described in the four females previously reported with the probably autosomal recessive Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome. Since the autosomal dominant Saethre-Chotzen syndrome may show similar cranio-facial features, short fingers with non-obligatory cutaneous syndactyly, and ossification defects of the cranial vault, the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome should also be considered in our patient.
