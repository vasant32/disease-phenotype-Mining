Four observations of Carpenter's Syndrome, two siblings and two unrelated children, and a case of Marshall-Smith's Syndrome are reported, all sharing duplication of the terminal phalanx of the big toe and a dyskephaly. Carpenter's Syndrome has been noted in at least 27 cases inheritance; is autosomalcessive. Main features are: oxycephaly, odd facies, brachyclinosyndactyly of the hands, polysyndactyly of the feet, cardiac malformation. The question is to be answered whether all cases are genetically identical.
