 PURPOSE: To report a case of a child with Pfeiffer syndrome, unique ocular anterior segment findings and a mutation in FGFR2 (Trp290Cys). METHODS: Case Report. RESULTS: We describe a patient with Pfeiffer syndrome with a unique constellation of ocular anterior segment anomalies including microcornea, limbal scleralization, corectopia and glaucoma. Genomic DNA extraction was heterozygous for a G to T mutation at nucleotide 870 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene (FGFR2) which changes tryptophan (TGG) to cysteine (TGT) at amino acid position 290 (Trp290Cys). CONCLUSION: This case supports the association between Pfeiffer syndrome and severe ocular anterior segment anomalies, including glaucoma, and underscores the possible role that FGFR2 has in development of the anterior segment of the eye.
