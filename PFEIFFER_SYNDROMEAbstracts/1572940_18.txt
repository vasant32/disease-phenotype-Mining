As part of an ongoing study of 119 patients with the Apert syndrome, extensive data were available for the analysis of oral manifestations, including mouth shape, lip posture, palatal morphology, dental anomalies, and malocclusion. Findings included a characteristic trapezoidal-shaped mouth. Cleft soft palate or bifid uvula was found in approximately 75%. A Byzantine-arch shaped palate was recorded in almost all patients. Dental anomalies included severely delayed eruption, ectopic eruption, and shovel-shaped incisors. Malocclusion tended to be severe with mesial molar occlusion, mandibular overjet, anterior and posterior crossbites, and severe crowding of teeth. The oral manifestations of Apert syndrome are compared and contrasted with those of Crouzon syndrome.
