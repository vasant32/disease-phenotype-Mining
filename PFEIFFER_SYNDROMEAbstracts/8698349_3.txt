Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal dominant acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome whose gene has been assigned to chromosome 7p. Cytogenetic and linkage analyses have enabled the interval encompassing the disease gene to be delimited to a short region of chromosome 7p15.3-p21.2. Based on the genetic analysis of three unreported families, we confirm the location of the disease gene(s) in the interval defined by loci D7S664 and D7S493 (Zmax = 4.78 at [symbol: see text] = 0 at the D7S488 locus) but fail to decide whether one or more disease-causing genes map in this genetic interval.
