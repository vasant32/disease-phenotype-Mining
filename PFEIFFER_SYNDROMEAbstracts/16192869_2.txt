After correction of moderate to severe hypertelorbitism (greater than 40 mm interdacryon distance) with facial bipartition or orbital box osteotomy, excess glabellar soft tissue and brow width should be addressed. Traditional methods described used a midline excision down the forehead and nasal dorsum, and left an unsightly scar. With a series of 12 patients, the authors document the K stitch technique with no external vertical scar. A mean 38.8% reduction of interbrow distance was noted using this technique. Two patients underwent revisions, and two patients had temporary eyelid ptosis. All patients reported satisfaction once the skin contracture was completed.
