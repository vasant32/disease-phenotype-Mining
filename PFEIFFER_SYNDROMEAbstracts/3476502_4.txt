A consecutive series of 21 patients with craniosynostosis syndromes (9 Crouzon's, 6 Pfeiffer's, 6 Apert's) was evaluated for reconstructive postoperative aesthetic improvement resulting from craniofacial surgery (Le Fort III, sliding genioplasty, nasal septal reconstruction and cranioplasty). The same consecutive series of patients had been previously evaluated for stability of Le Fort III advancement. All the patients were assessed at least one year post operatively. Stability of the advancement was confirmed. In the present study, various midline bony and soft tissue profile measurements were obtained from lateral cephalograms. These measurements were compared to similar measurements (standards) in normals. "Normal" standards and "normal" appearance imply harmonious and aesthetically pleasing facial features. This study showed markedly abnormal positions of the selected bony and soft tissue landmarks preoperatively compared to the normal but following surgery the measurements studied approached or were similar to the normal standards. Based on these measurements, the patient's appearance improved significantly following reconstructive craniofacial surgery. Suggestions for additional surgery based on these studies are made.
