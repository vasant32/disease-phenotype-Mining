Syndactyly is one of the most common congenital anomalies of the hand. It can be isolated or associated with systemic syndromes. Surgical treatment is performed between the ages of six and 18 months depending on the type and extent of the malformation. Commissure construction is achieved using local flaps. Direct closure of the lateral sides of the digits is possible in many cases. In complex cases, and/or when adjacent web spaces are involved, full-thickness skin grafts remain useful. Functional and cosmetic results are usually excellent in simple cases. In complex cases, postoperative prognosis depends on the severity of bone, joint and tendons abnormalities.
