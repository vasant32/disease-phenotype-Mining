Three dimensional computed tomography (CT) is a relatively new method of arranging the elements of CT slices into a morphological image with a multi dimensional appearance. It is of particular use in craniofacial deformities. The following report shows its use in the pre and post operative assessment of frontal skull deformity in three infants with coronal synostosis.
