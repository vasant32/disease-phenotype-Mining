A weak minded man aged 31 years exhibited with moderate acrobrachycephalia, basal cutaneous syndactylies of the 2nd and 3rd fingers, marking symptoms of the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), with dominant inheritance in three generations. Additionally there were symptoms of Ascher's syndrome, blepharochalasis, goitre and broad lower lip. The psychic maldevelopment is considered in association with a syndrome of the frontal lobe. Severe craniostenosis is rare at SCS; cosmetic handicap and obstruction of the nasal airway can be corrected by craniofacial surgeon.
