The results of 32 patients who underwent transcranial monobloc frontofacial advancement by the senior author (Wolfe) are examined. Fifteen of the patients were Crouzon's and 17 were Apert's, 14 of whom also underwent simultaneous facial bipartition. The ages ranged from 7 months to 14 years. Although a transcranial facial advancement carries with it substantial risks, with careful consideration of airway control, the anterior cranial base dura, and the retrofrontal dead space, the procedure is recommended for carefully selected patients. The indications and contraindications for the procedure in various age groups are given.
