Apert syndrome is characterized by coronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, symmetrical syndactyly of the hands and feet described as 'mitten-like' with varying degrees of mental retardation. It results from a mutation of the fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGFR2) gene. In the absence of a family history, prenatal diagnosis may be difficult based on sonography alone. We report a case in which the prenatal diagnosis of Apert syndrome was suspected by ultrasonography, established by three-dimensional computed tomography scan (3DTS) and confirmed by the detection of a mutation on amniotic cells. This underscores the usefulness of a sequential diagnostic approach combining 3DTS and molecular biology in cases in which sonography alone is not con- clusive.
