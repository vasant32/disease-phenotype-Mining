Syndromic craniosynostoses are commonly treated conditions in craniofacial units. The features of the common syndromes (Apert, Pfeiffer and Crouzon) all include craniosynostosis, mid-face hypoplasia and ocular proptosis. The craniofacial management of a child with these syndromes through to adulthood may require a number of surgical interventions to allow brain development, to provide an adequate airway, to prevent corneal ulceration and to provide a functional dental occlusion. The management of these different priorities into timed interventions in our unit is determined by established protocols. We report two cases that underwent simultaneous mid-face (Le Fort III) and fronto-orbital osteotomies followed by distraction but using different vectors to advance the upper and mid-face regions (to achieve all treatment goals) in a 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl.
