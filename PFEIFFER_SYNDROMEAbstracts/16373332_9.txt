Most Apert syndrome patients harbor a single amino acid mutation (S252W) in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 2 (FGFR2), which leads to abnormal FGF/FGFR2 signaling. Here we show that specific combinations of FGFs and glycosaminoglycans activate both alternative splice forms of the mutant but not of the wild-type FGF receptors. More importantly, 2-O- and N-sulfated heparan sulfate, prepared by a combined chemical and enzymatic synthesis, antagonized the over-activated FGFR2b (S252W) to basal levels at nanomolar concentrations. These studies demonstrated that specific glycosaminoglycans could be useful in treating ligand-dependent FGFR signaling-related diseases, such as Apert syndrome and cancer.
