The hand deformities in Apert's syndrome are among the most complex congenital hand problems to reconstruct due to the skeletal malalignment, symphalangism, and progressive functional deficits with growth. Ten children with Apert's syndactyly underwent early surgical intervention (mean age 8.4 months) as part of a staged program of digital separation leading to completion of both hands by the age of 2 years. The incidence of major complications was low, rate of revision (18 percent) acceptable, and the aesthetic result very satisfactory. Long-term functional results tend to reflect the effect of progressive intrinsic disease despite preservation of skeletal alignment and digital form with growth. However, the aesthetic improvement and potential for greater functional gains at a young age support the concept of early surgical intervention in this syndrome.
