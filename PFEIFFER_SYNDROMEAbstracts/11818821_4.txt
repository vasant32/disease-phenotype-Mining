Children born with Apert acrocephalosyndactyly pose great challenges to the pediatric hand surgeon. Reconstructive dilemmas consist of shortened, deviated phalanges and extensive skin deficits following syndactyly release. We present a 10-year review of patients with Apert acrocephalosyndactyly who were treated with a simplified surgical approach. Between 1986 and 1996, 10 patients with Apert syndrome underwent reconstructive surgery of their hands. The overall strategy involved early bilateral separation of syndactylous border digits at 1 year of age, followed by sequential unilateral middle syndactyly mass separation with thumb osteotomy and bone grafting as needed. In these 10 patients, a total of 53 web spaces were released, 49 of which involved osteotomies for complex syndactyly. Only local flaps and full-thickness skin grafts from the groin were used in all cases to achieve soft-tissue coverage. To date, seven of the 53 web spaces have needed revision (revision rate, 13 percent). Eleven thumb osteotomies (nine opening wedge and two closing wedge) were performed. Bone grafts from the proximal ulna or from other digits were used in all cases. To date, none of these thumb osteotomies have needed revision. This early, simplified approach to the complex hand anomalies of Apert acrocephalosyndactyly has been successful in achieving low revision rates and excellent functional outcomes as measured by gross grasp and pinch and by patient and parent satisfaction.
