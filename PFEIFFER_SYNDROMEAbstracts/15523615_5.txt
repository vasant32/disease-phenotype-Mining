Mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) cause a variety of craniosynostosis syndromes. The mutational spectrum tends to be narrow with the majority of mutations occurring in either exon IIIa or IIIc or in the intronic sequence preceding exon IIIc. Mutations outside of this hotspot are uncommon and the few identified mutations have demonstrated wide clinical variability, making it difficult to establish a clear-cut genotype-phenotype correlation. To better delineate the clinical picture associated with these unusual mutations, we describe a severely affected patient with Pfeiffer syndrome and a missense mutation in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of FGFR2.
