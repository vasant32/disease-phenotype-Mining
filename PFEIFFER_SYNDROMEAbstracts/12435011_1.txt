Apert's syndrome is a developmental malformation characterized by craniosynostosis, a cone shaped calvarium, midface hypoplasia, pharyngeal attenuation, ocular manifestations and syndactyly of the hands and feet. The prodromal characteristic for the typical craniofacial appearance is early craniosynostosis of the coronal suture, cranial base and an agenesis of the sagittal suture. These craniofacial characteristics predispose the patient to maxillary transverse and sagittal hypoplasia with concomitant dental crowding, a pseudo cleft palate and a skeletal and dental anterior open bite. A case of Apert syndrome is presented with special emphasis on craniofacial characteristics and multidisciplinary approach to treatment. The differences between Apert and Crouzon's syndrome are highlighted.
