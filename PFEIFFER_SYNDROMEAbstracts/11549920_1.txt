The case of a child with Apert syndrome is presented in which the development and rupture of an intracranial mycotic aneurysm occurred secondary to multiple infectious complications following craniofacial surgery. An endovascular procedure was utilized in an attempt to embolize the aneurysm and parent vessel. The patient recovered from her infections, but retained a residual right hemiparesis and left cranial nerve III palsy at the time of discharge. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a mycotic aneurysm developing after a craniofacial procedure. Risk factors leading to aneurysm formation in this case are presented, as well as a literature review of neurological complications following craniofacial surgery.
