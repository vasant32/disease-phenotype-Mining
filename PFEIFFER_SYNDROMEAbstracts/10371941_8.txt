Since the initial application of distraction osteogenesis to the human mandible by McCarthy, distraction osteogenesis has been used for gradual lengthening of the midface in children with syndromic craniosynostosis, cleft lip and palate, hemifacial microsomia, and midface hypoplasia from other causes. Both external and internal devices are available that permit midface distraction. The background of midface distraction and the development of a Modular Internal Distraction (MID) system that permits widespread use of easily customized, buried distraction devices throughout the craniofacial region are presented. The relative and potential clinical indications for distraction, treatment planning, patient preparation, and possible surgical orthodontic interactions during distraction, as well as a variety of case examples showing the MID system, are discussed.
