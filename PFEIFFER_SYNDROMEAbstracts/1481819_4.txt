We report on a 20-month-old boy with skull malformations and motor delays. A diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome was made in view of the clinical and neuroradiological signs. Other unusual findings were trigonocephaly and occipital dysplasia with medial schisis at the foramen occipitalis. The mother showed a mild expression of the syndrome.
