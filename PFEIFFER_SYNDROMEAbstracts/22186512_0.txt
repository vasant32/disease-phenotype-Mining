 BACKGROUND: Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and midface hypoplasia are often treated with Le Fort III advancement. The authors present four patients with extraordinarily long-term follow-up (in excess of 20 years). METHODS: An institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with syndromic craniofacial synostosis who underwent Le Fort III advancement. Patients with greater than 20 years of cephalometric and photographic records were identified. Lateral cephalograms were obtained preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, at 1-year follow-up, and at long-term follow-up. Cephalograms were traced, digitized, and averaged. Fifty cephalometric landmarks were identified for serial measurements. RESULTS: Of the four patients identified, one had Apert syndrome and three had Crouzon syndrome. Average age at the time of Le Fort III advancements was 11 years (range, 4 to 20 years). Average length of postoperative follow-up was 25 years (Â± 5 years). No patient had significant anterior midfacial growth following Le Fort III advancement. Both young patients (<10 years) had substantial vertical inferior midfacial growth after advancement. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the Le Fort III segment of children with syndromic craniosynostosis does not grow significantly forward. Moreover, the traditional Le Fort III osteotomy does not provide the amount of midface advancement necessary to avoid phenotypic recidivism in these syndromic patients. This study also suggests that patients undergoing Le Fort III advancement appear to have zygomatic effacement and ptosis of the overlying soft tissue with deepening of the facial folds; collectively, it is suggested that these changes give the appearance of accelerated facial aging.
