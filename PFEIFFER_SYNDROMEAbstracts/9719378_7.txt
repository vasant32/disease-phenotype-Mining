Apert syndrome, characterised by craniosynostosis, craniofacial anomalies, and symmetrical syndactyly of the digits (cutaneous and bony fusion), has been associated with two canonical mutations in the FGFR2 gene (S252W, P253R) in the great majority of cases. Since these two alterations have been observed exclusively among these patients, it has been suggested that the S252W and P253R changes may play an important role in the occurrence of syndactyly. In order to verify whether the mutations S252W and P253R could also cause a milder phenotype, without involvement of the limbs, we have screened 22 patients with clinical characteristics compatible with Crouzon or Pfeiffer syndrome for these two particular changes. Surprisingly, we identified a Pfeiffer-like patient with the mutation S252W, and therefore we have shown for the first time the occurrence of one of the canonical Apert mutations without severe abnormalities of the upper and lower extremities.
