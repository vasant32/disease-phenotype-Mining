Apert syndrome is characterised by craniosynostosis, associated with maxillary hypoplasia, symmetrical syndactyly of the hands and feet, and other systemic malformations including mental retardation. Apert syndrome and septo-optic dysplasia is rarely described. We describe the classical clinical and radiological findings of this syndrome in a 20-year-old woman. Though early surgical intervention is imperative for optimal outcome, in developing countries, it may not be possible to intervene at the right time due to financial constraints.
