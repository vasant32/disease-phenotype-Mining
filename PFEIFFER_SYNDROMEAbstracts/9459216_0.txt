Apert syndrome is characterized by severe craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, and symmetric syndactyly of the hands and sometimes of the feet. In this study, postal questionnaires were completed by parents of 41 children with Apert syndrome. Data from this preliminary survey revealed that the children functioned fairly well socially despite their disabilities and potential for psychological difficulties. Parents suffered from stress caused by problems over acceptance of the child's appearance, the child's behavioural problems, and parental low self-esteem. Ten mothers and eight fathers scored in the deviant range for parental stress, suggesting a need for psychological counselling.
