Craniosynostosis in Apert syndrome is routinely treated by wide frontal and bilateral supraorbital reshaping and posterior cranial decompression. Dynamic cranial vault expansion has proved to be useful in craniofacial surgery, and its use has extended to syndromic patients. Although a controversy remains between conventional osteotomy and application of the spring-mediated technique in surgical treatment of craniosynostosis, there have been several positive clinical reports on expansion techniques for nonsyndromic and syndromic craniosynostosis. Simultaneous fronto-orbital advancement and posterior cranial vault expansion have been applied successfully to 2 patients of Apert syndrome, without intraoperative complications or postoperative morbidity and improving final cranial shape.
