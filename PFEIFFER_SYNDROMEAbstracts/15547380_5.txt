Distraction osteogenesis has provided a powerful technique for the treatment of severe midfacial hypoplasia. Skeletal fixation is a critical component of successful distraction osteogenesis. This is a report on the development of a new approach to bone fixation for distraction osteogenesis of the midface, based on circumferential suspension of the entire midfacial skeleton using surgical wires placed through the soft palate. This technique offers the advantages of (1) complete control of the attitude of the midface in terms of a precise dispersion of forces that can determine the desired pitch, yaw, and roll of this skeletal complex during the active phase of distraction, (2) being compatible with young children in the deciduous dentition stage because it obviates the need for rigid fixation devices on the maxillary lateral walls in the proximity of numerous dental follicles of the unerupted adult dentition, (3) actually serving as the instrument for posterior maxillary "lift" in cases of skeletal open bite malocclusions (frequently seen in the craniosynostoses), thereby allowing the clinician to determine the final occlusal and palatal planes and simultaneously close the open bite. An illustrative case of a 5(1/2)-year-old girl with Apert syndrome is presented wherein her ventilatory obstruction and ocular proptosis were significantly improved.
