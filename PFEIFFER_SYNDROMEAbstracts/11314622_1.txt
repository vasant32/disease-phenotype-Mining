Morbidity from corneal ulcers is often severe in patients with Apert syndrome. These patients are at an increased risk of developing corneal ulcers because of the compromised corneal environment secondary to exophthalmos. During the past 6 years, three of five patients treated for Apert syndrome at our hospital have developed corneal ulcers. We present a case series discussing each patient, reasons for the development of ulceration, treatment, and outcomes. Morbidities in our group of patients included decreased visual acuity, opacified corneas, amblyopia, and blindness. Treatment is often difficult and complex. Therefore, an ophthalmologist should be an active team member in treating Apert patients.
