This paper reports a cephalometric analysis of the craniofacial morphology in adolescents and adults with Apert syndrome. The sample comprised 26 patients with Apert syndrome (15 males and 11 females). The control group consisted of 153 adults (102 males and 51 females). Both lateral and frontal cephalograms were studied. The data were presented as mean plots of the craniofacial region together with data on some of the most significant findings. Marked differences were found in nearly all craniofacial regions except the mandible. The calvaria was increased in height and width but length was decreased. The cranial base showed marked protrusion of the greater wing of the sphenoid, which contributed to severe reduction of orbital volume and protrusion of the eyeglobe. Orbital volume was further reduced by maxillary hypoplasia in all three planes of space together with retrognathia. Maxillary height was extremely short and so was the nose. The width of the nasal cavity, height and depth of the bony nasopharynx, and the nasopharyngeal airway were all markedly reduced in size. The mandible was of fairly normal size and shape but was posteriorly inclined. Head posture was extended in relation to the cervical column. Total facial height was increased, whereas upper facial height was markedly reduced. Incisor occlusion showed mandibular overjet and open bite. Apert syndrome patients were then compared to a group of Crouzon syndrome patients. Marked and significant differences were found between the two syndromes in nearly all craniofacial regions, and craniofacial dysmorphology was generally more severe in Apert syndrome patients.
