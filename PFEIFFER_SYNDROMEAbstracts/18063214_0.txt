Apert syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by severe syndactyly of the feet and hands, craniofacial abnormalities, and craniosynostosis. A 7-month-old male infant with Apert syndrome who underwent direct bronchoscopy and tracheotomy during general anesthesia is presented. Early rigid bronchoscopy is important in these patients when there are problems with the airway, as they have a relatively high incidence of airway anomalies.
