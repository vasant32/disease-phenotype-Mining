Poswillo has stated, "The more severe anomalies of the calvaria, such as plagiocephaly, Crouzon [syndrome], and Apert syndrome still defy explanation, in the absence of an appropriate animal system to study" (p. 207). This two-part study reviews data from a recently developed colony of New Zealand white rabbits with familial, nonsyndromic unilateral coronal suture synostosis. Part 1 presents pathological findings and compensatory sutural growth data from 109 normal rabbits and 82 craniosynostotic rabbits from this colony. Synostotic foci, onset, and progression were described in the calvariae from 102 staged (fetal days 21, 25, 27, 33; term = 30 days) fetuses (39 normal, 63 synostosed). Calvarial suture growth patterns from 10 to 126 days of age were assessed from serial radiographs obtained from 89 rabbits (70 normal rabbits and 19 rabbits with unicoronal suture synostosis) with amalgam bone marker implants. Perinatal results revealed that by fetal day 25 the synostotic focal point in synostotic rabbits consistently originated from the endocortical surface of the calvaria in the middle of the coronal suture at a presumed high-tension, interdigitating zone. Histological analysis revealed hyperostotic osteogenic fronts on the affected side compared with the unaffected side. Postnatal sutural growth data revealed a predictable pattern of plagiocephaly (contralateral coronal sutures growing more than ipsilateral sutures and ipsilateral frontonasal and anterior lambdoidal sutures growing more than contralateral sutures), which resulted in early cranial vault deformities and a double "S" shape torquing towards the affected side. The advantages and disadvantages of these rabbits as a model for human familial, nonsyndromic unicoronal suture synostosis are discussed, especially in light of recent cytokine and genetic findings from human craniosynostotic studies.
