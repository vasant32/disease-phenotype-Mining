Craniofacial syndromes, including Crouzon syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Apert syndrome and achondroplasia, have been indicated that syndromes were associated with mutations of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene families. In this report, seven Japanese patients with craniofacial syndromes, three Crouzon syndromes and four achondroplasias, were analyzed on FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes by non RI-SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphisms) and direct sequencing. Missense mutations of the FGFR3 exon 10, at codon 380 in two sporadic cases and codon 375 in two familial cases, were detected in all cases of achondroplasia. Mutations of the FGFR2 were noted in Crouzon and Apert syndromes. One of three Crouzon syndromes has a missense mutation at codon 342 on exon 9. Highly frequent mutations were clustered within some localized regions of the FGFR genes in craniofacial syndromes. Alterations in these receptors due to missense mutations would thus appear closely involved in pathogenesis of craniofacial syndrome. The non RI-SSCP and direct sequencing of the FGFR genes, shown in this report, may be an appropriate approach for diagnosis of these syndromes with extensive clinical application.
