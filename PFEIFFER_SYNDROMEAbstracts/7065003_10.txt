We report the prenatal diagnosis of the Apert syndrome by fetoscopy. The patient was a 22-year-old college student with this autosomal dominant form of acrocephalosyndactyly whose first pregnancy had resulted in a stillborn, affected infant. Fetoscopy at 17 weeks showed that she was carrying another affected fetus, and the pregnancy was terminated.
