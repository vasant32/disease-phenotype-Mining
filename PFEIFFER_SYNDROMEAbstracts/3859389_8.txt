The method of mean tensor analysis was used to study the cranial base in six craniofacial anomalies: Crouzon's disease, Apert's syndrome, Pfeiffer's syndrome, craniofacial microsomia (CFM), Treacher Collins (TC) syndrome, and frontonasal dysplasia (FND). The form was represented by five landmarks: the nasion (N), basion (Ba), sella (S), frontomaxillonasal suture (FMN), and sphenoethmoidal registration point (SE), and the deformities were computed as mean deformations from age- and sex-matched normal mean forms. The cranial base in CFM is normal in shape. The other five syndromes manifest four distinct patterns of shape variation. Only in TC and Pfeiffer's syndrome is the cranial-base angle distinctive. In Apert's and Crouzon's syndromes, point SE is displaced anteriorly upon a cranial base, small in size but otherwise normal in shape. In TC syndrome and FND, point SE is displaced posteriorly toward the sella.
