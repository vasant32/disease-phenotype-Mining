Monobloc fronto-facial advancement (TESSIER's technic) seems to be the best therapeutic to correct retromaxillia, sequellae of cranio-facio-stenosis. From an aesthetical and functional point of view the result is more satisfactory than with a simple LE FORT III osteotomy advancement. Intermaxillary fixation is not necessary. Of course an orthodontic sequence must be associated to correct dental malposition.
