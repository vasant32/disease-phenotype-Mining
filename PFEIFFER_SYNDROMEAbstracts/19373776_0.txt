Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome involving craniosynostosis, craniofacial abnormalities, and syndactyly. A recent Scandinavian study reported an increased risk of breast cancer in individuals with a clinical diagnosis of SCS. Because of the potential importance of this finding, we organized a multicenter study enrolling people with TWIST1 mutation confirmed SCS to determine if an increased risk of cancer is present. This study did not identify any cases of breast or ovarian cancer in a cohort of equivalent power to that reported previously. These results provide clinical reassurance that at present there is no evidence for breast cancer screening above standard practice for individuals with SCS.
