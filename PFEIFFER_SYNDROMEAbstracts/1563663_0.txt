Our craniofacial surgery team includes experts from the following fields: plastic surgery, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, genetics, neurology, orthodontics, pedodontics, facial rehabilitation, psychiatry, social work, anesthesiology and intensive care. Craniofacial surgery became to a large extent pediatric surgery, following evidence that careful, early surgery does not impair growth and that development following surgery is almost normal. The malformations that were repaired included those of the Crouzon and Apert syndromes, requiring frontal remodelling and advancement of the middle third of the facial skeleton; hypertelorism in which orbits were moved to the midline; large craniofacial clefts in which the hemiface from either side was moved to the midline; and different types of craniostenosis in which frontal advancement and remodelling with reconstruction of the vault was performed. The series consisted of 78 patients who presented between 1979-1989. 3 illustrative cases are described.
