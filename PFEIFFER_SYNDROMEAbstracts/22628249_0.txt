The authors describe on a Brazilian girl with coronal synostosis, facial asymmetry, ptosis, brachydactyly, significant learning difficulties, recurrent scalp infections with marked hair loss, and elevated serum immunoglobulin E. Standard lymphocyte karyotype showed a small additional segment in 7p21[46,XX,add(7)(p21)]. Deletion of the TWIST1 gene, detected by Multiplex Ligation Probe-dependent Amplification (MPLA) and array-CGH, was consistent with phenotype of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Array CGH also showed deletion of four other genes at 7p21.1 (SNX13, PRPS1L1, HD9C9, and FERD3L) and the deletion of six genes (CACNA2D2, C3orf18, HEMK1, CISH, MAPKAPK3, and DOCK3) at 3p21.31. Our case reinforces FERD3L as candidate gene for intellectual disability and suggested that genes located in 3p21.3 can be related to hyper IgE phenotype.
