 UNLABELLED: FUNDAMENTAL AND OBJECTIVE: Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is a heart-hand disease with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. About 85% of the affected patients present de novo mutations in the TBX5 gene. The aim of this study is to propose a molecular strategy to diagnose patients with clinical suspicion of HOS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A sequence analysis of 7 patients from exon 2 to exon 8 of the TBX5 gene was performed. MLPAp179 and MLPAp180 were performed in those cases in which no mutation was found. RESULTS: p.Arg270X and p.Ala34Glyfsx27 mutations were identified in 2 cases. These cases fulfilled the strict clinical criteria, had a family history of HOS and had similar clinical features. In other three cases, MLPA results showed deletions of the GLI3 coding region. CONCLUSIONS: In order to increase the TBX5 mutation detection rate, an exhaustive physical examination focused on the strict clinical criteria may be necessary to rule out clinical overlapping syndromes. We propose that molecular analysis of GLI3 may be performed in patients with clinical suspicion of HOS without mutations in TBX5.
