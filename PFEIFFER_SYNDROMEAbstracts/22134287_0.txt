A 3-point skeletal anchorage with taping screws for distraction osteogenesis after a Le Fort III osteotomy was applied for the first time in a severely mentally impaired patient where intraoral devices had to be avoided. All 3-force application points included the center of resistance, which allowed an optimal control on the resulting moment. A novel device for skeletal long-term retention into the nasal dorsum prevented a relapse, whereas adjustment of the midface position was observed. Fusioned three-dimensional computed tomography analysis revealed real movements not accessible by a conventional cephalometry.
