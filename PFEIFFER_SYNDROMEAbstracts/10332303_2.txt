A neonate presented with cloverleaf skull anomaly and severe proptosis requiring urgent cranioplasty to attain eyelid closure. Despite this, she experienced exposure keratitis and corneal perforations. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was performed subsequently to relieve hydrocephalus, but respiratory problems eventually led to her death at 6 months. This case highlights the complexity of the problems encountered in the cloverleaf skull anomaly, and a brief review discussing its management is included. Despite improvements in treatment of this condition, the overall prognosis remains poor.
