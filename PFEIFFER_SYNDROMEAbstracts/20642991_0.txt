BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: poliosis is an inherited or acquired loss of pigment from a group of closely positioned hair follicles characterized by a patch of white hair. It is commonly seen in vitiligo, piebaldism, Waardenburg syndrome, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, Griscelli syndrome, and Apert syndrome. We investigated a male manifesting poliosis on the chin after repetitive plucking. CONCLUSION: to our knowledge, poliosis induced by repeated plucking has never been documented.
