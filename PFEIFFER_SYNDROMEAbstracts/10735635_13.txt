Apert syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by craniosynostosis and severe syndactyly, caused by two recurrent mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene (FGFR2). The genotype-phenotype correlations of 21 patients with Apert syndrome were analysed as to the craniofacial appearance following surgery and the degree of syndactlyly. The craniofacial appearance following craniofacial surgery was better in patients with the P253R mutation, whereas these patients showed a more pronounced severity of the syndactyly.
