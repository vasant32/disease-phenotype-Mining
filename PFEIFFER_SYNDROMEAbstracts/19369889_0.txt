The frontofacial monobloc advancement is a safe, effective, and cosmetically acceptable treatment of frontal and midface retrusions present in craniofacial syndromes. Although a number of modifications have been put forward to supplement this procedure, the basic steps of cleaving the facial skeleton from the skull base remain the same. We present a case where intraoperative navigation was used to visualize the craniofacial anatomy while the bone cuts were made for this cleaving process. This technique visually demonstrates parts of this procedure that were hitherto performed solely using tactile and auditory inputs superimposed on a 3-dimensional model of the craniofacial anatomy in the surgeon's mind. This technique offers a significant advantage for teaching purposes, in performing cases with complex anatomy and for accurate positioning of the distractor devices.
