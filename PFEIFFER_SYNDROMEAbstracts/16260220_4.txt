Apert syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by coronal craniosynostosis, syndactyly, brachycephaly, midfacial hypoplasia, and central nervous system anomalies, among other malformations. We present a case of Apert syndrome examined at 22 + 0 weeks' gestation. Three-dimensional maximum mode was decisive for the correct prenatal diagnosis by demonstrating the cranial deformities.
