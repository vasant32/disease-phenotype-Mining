We describe a boy with Apert syndrome, including cranial deformities and syndactyly (acrocephalosyndactyly), though intracranial hypertension, exophthalmos, and midfacial hypoplasia were mild. We treated him by mandibular distraction, in addition to fronto-orbital distraction, and Le Fort III midfacial distraction, with good results.
