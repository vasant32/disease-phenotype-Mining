The pathologic anatomy of the central nervous system is described in a patient with Apert's syndrome. Multiple developmental anomalies of the brain were noted including disturbances of rhinencephalic organization. The association between maldevelopment of the rhinencephalon and the face is well known. Cranial vault malformations may also be associated with maldevelopment of the rhinencephalon.
