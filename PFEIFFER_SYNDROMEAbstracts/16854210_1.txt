OBJECTIVE: To present orthodontic treatment combined with dual segmental distraction osteogenesis in a patient with Apert syndrome. PATIENT: A 15-year-old boy exhibited severe midfacial hypoplasia with retruded and hypoplastic maxilla and anterior open bite. The patient was treated with a rigid external distraction II system for distraction osteogenesis, a preadjusted edgewise appliance, and a modified maxillary protraction headgear. The concave profile with midfacial hypoplasia was improved. A tight occlusal relationship between maxillary and mandibular teeth was achieved. Postoperative treatment results have been stable for 1 year.
