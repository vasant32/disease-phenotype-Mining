A 19-year-old male with Apert's syndrome developed psychotic symptoms that responded to haloperidol. He was also found to have partial agenesis of the corpus callosum and enlarged lateral ventricles on a head CT scan. The implications of these findings in the context of psychotic symptoms are discussed. There are no previous reports of psychosis in patients with Apert's syndrome.
