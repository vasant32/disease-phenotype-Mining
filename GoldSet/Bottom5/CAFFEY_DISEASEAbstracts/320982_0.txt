We describe a case of infantile cortical hyperostosis or Caffey-Silverman's disease. This is the fourth case reported in the national literature and the third one in our Hospital de Pediatr√≠a of the National Medical Center. We made an extensive review of the national and international literature and we defined the characteristic findings in this pathologic entity. We analyzed the etiologic possibilities, which are not yet clear and emphasized the role of the genetic factors. We suggest to investigate intentionally the asymptomatic colaterals, on the way to establish the real frequency of the disease.
