Facial nerve palsy was diagnosed in a 13-month-old child with infantile cortical hyperostosis. Facial palsy preceded the roentgenographic evidence of mandibular hyperostosis but there was concurrent evidence of hyperostosis of multiple other bones. This case exemplifies the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for infantile cortical hyperostosis in infants and children presenting with facial swelling and facial nerve palsy.
