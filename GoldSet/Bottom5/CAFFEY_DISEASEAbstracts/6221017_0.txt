Two patients with infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey's disease) are presented in whom radionuclide imaging with 99mTc-MDP and 67Gallium-citrate was performed to eliminate multifocal osteomyelitis as a diagnosis. The scintigraphic appearance of this relatively uncommon disease of children was similar to that obtained in multifocal osteomyelitis; all osseous lesions showed a marked uptake of both radiotracers. However, the distribution of abnormalities (mandible, scapulae) and the degree of extension (mainly diaphyseal) of the lesions are important characteristics in the scintigraphic differential diagnosis but bone radiographs are best used in making the diagnosis.
