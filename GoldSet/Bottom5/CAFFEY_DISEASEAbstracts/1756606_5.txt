Cortical Infantile Hyperostosis (Caffey's disease) is a benign and self-limited disorder. Late recurrence or persistence of symptoms with deformity seems exceedingly rare. Its occurrence in isolated cases or in multiple members in families suggests the existence of two different forms, namely a sporadic form and a familial form. The tibia is the predominant bone known to be affected in the familial form, while the mandible is mostly affected in the sporadic form. The different pathological processes found in these two forms add further to the heterogeneity of this disorder. We describe an Arabic-Christian, non-consanguineous family with two affected sibs. In one, recurrent Caffey's disease was diagnosed at the age of 11 years.
