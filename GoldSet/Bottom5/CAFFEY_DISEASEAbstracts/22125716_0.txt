Caffey disease or Infantile Cortical Hyperostosis (ICH) is a rare and mostly self limiting condition affecting young infants. It is characterized by acute inflammation of the periostium and the overlying soft tissue and is accompanied by systemic changes of irritability and fever. Diagnosis may be delayed as this disorder mimics a wide range of diseases including osteomyelitis, hypervitaminosis A, scurvy, bone tumors and child abuse. The emphasis here is to remind clinicians about the existence of the disease in this country.
