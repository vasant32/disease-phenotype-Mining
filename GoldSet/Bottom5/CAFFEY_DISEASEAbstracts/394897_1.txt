Infantile cortical hyperostosis may mimic a variety of serious conditions in early infancy, such as trauma, vitamin deficiencies, infection, or tumors, In a patient in good general condition there are typical roentgenological features often with involvement of the mandible that are diagnostic of the condition. In 3 cases of infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey's disease), one had the clinical picture of Erb's palsy and subsequently developed hyperostosis of the scapula. The second, had a "pulled elbow" and radial nerve palsy and later developed hyperostotic changes in the humerus and radius on the same side. The third was referred for treatment of congenital torticollis and found to develop hyperostosis of the clavicle on the same side. The recognition of this condition obviates unnecessary prolonged investigation and treatment.
