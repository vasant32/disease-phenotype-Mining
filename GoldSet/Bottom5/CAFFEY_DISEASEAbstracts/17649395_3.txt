Hyperostosis "thick legs" is reported in a case involving 7 of a litter of 11 purebred Landrace piglets. The 12 limbs involved showed variable degrees of thickening and immobility; tension and fixation of the skin. Necropsy revealed extensive fibrous connective tissue, enlargement and edema of associated lymph nodes and hypoplasia of muscle groups. Radiographs revealed osteodystrophia along the shafts of long bones. The case is compared to previous reports of infantile cortical hyperostosis in children and "thick legs" in pigs.
