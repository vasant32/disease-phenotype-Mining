A case of infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey's disease) is presented with its usual clinical and radiological manifestations. The accompanying anaemia and thrombocytopenia as seen in our case is discussed. The possibility of autoantibodies secondary to an immunological defect is put forward to explain the cause of the anaemia and thrombocytopenia. This may be a new feature of the disease or a modification of the current concept.
