Two cases of infantile cortical hyperostosis, both of the monostotic form, are described. In the first patient the right clavicle was involved; the disease may have been present from birth, but resulted in the infant's admission at the age of six weeks. The second patient was a 7-month old infant who developed the disease after an upper respiratory tract infection. There were only minor changes in the left clavicle. Both cases regressed almost completely within six months. The discussion deals with the largely unsolved problems concerning infantile cortical hyperostosis.
