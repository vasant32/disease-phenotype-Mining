We describe a boy aged nine months with infantile cortical hyperostosis in association with cystic fibrosis. Symmetrical periosteal thickening was present in the clavicles, ribs, femora, humeri, ulnae and radii. Periosteal hyperostosis of the humerus developed in association with an increase in the levels of serum alkaline phosphatase a month before the appearance of hyperirritability and soft tissue swelling about the hip joints. The condition gradually resolved during the following eight months.
