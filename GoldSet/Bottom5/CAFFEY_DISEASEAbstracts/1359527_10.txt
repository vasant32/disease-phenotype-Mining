An early case of prenatal Caffey disease is reported. Ultrasound examination performed at 20 weeks showed major angulations of long bones, but both ultrasound scan and X-rays failed to make the differential diagnosis between Caffey disease and lethal osteogenesis imperfecta. A cordocentesis allowed us to find important biological abnormalities. The pregnancy was terminated after the rapid development of hydrops fetalis. The definitive diagnosis of Caffey disease was obtained by special X-ray and pathological study.
