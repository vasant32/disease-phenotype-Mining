Infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey-Silverman syndrome) is an uncommon and not well-understood disorder. Most authors confine cortical hyperostosis strictly to infants under six months of age as originally described by Caffey. Others indicate they have seen the same clinical, radiographic, and pathologic problem in older children as initial presentations or as a recurrence where the infantile phase had possibly been unrecognized. This is a report of idiopathic cortical hyperostosis (ICH) in an 11-year-old girl who had no history of the disorder as an infant. The report confirms others who have documented cortical hyperostosis in older children and postulates that it is the same entity as infantile cortical hyperostosis.
