Infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH) or Caffey-Silverman disease is affection that attained skeleton most frequently flat bones, contiguous fasciae and muscles. We reported the case of a 3 months old female infant of Mauritanian origin, referred for recurrent osteitis of the left clavicle. The present complaints are incessant snivelling and functional disability of the left upper limb. Examination showed clavicular and mandibular swelling, without fever. Biological check-up showed inflammatory signs. Radiographies showed cortical thickening of the left clavicle and mandible. Interest of such an observation is in the rarity of this affection, its originality as for the striking age limitation, in the disconcerting but suggestive symptomatology, at least in the classical sites and in the possibility of its antenatal diagnosis.
