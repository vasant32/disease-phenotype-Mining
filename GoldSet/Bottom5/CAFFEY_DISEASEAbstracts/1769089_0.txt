In 1984-1989 at the First Paediatric Clinic of the Motol Faculty Hospital six patients with the diagnosis of infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey-Silvermann syndrome) were hospitalized. Non-familial concurrence of the disease was involved. All children developed the disease before the age of 4.5 months, four before the age of three months. Among the six patients was only one girl. As to pathological findings there was a markedly elevated FW in 5/6, leucocytosis in 5/6, thrombocytosis in 3/4, eosinophilia in 3/6, elevated alkaline phosphatases in 2/6. The affection was four times on the mandible, once in the area of the hip joints and in one instance it was multifocal. The authors present one detailed case-history with extreme affection of the clavicle which was originally taken for a bone tumour.
