Infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH), or Caffey's disease, first reported by Caffey and Silverman in 1945, is a benign condition characterized radiographically by corticoperiosteal thickening of bone with subperiosteal new bone formation. Sites of occurrence vary, with the mandible being involved in 75%-80% of cases. The following is a case report of ICH limited to four contiguous ribs with no evidence of mandibular involvement.
