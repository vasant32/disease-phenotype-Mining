The ultrastructure and the immunohistochemical pattern of the cells which are responsible for the bone resorption in the cortical infantile hyperostosis were investigated. The osteoclasts present a great positivity to MB1 antigen and a low positivity to OKM5. Mononuclear cells with primary lysosomes, looking like osteoclast ones are present in high concentration in peritrabecular spaces. These cells show a high positivity to OKM5 antigen and a low positivity to MB1 antigen. The mononuclear granulated cells are positive to tartrate-resistent acid phosphatase. The possible common origin and their co-operation in bone resorption is discussed.
