A four-month-old infant was treated for dysphagia associated with infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey's disease). Prolonged nutritional support was by nasal or gastrostoma intubation; therapeutic oral feeding was continued. This approach encouraged the development of oral feeding skills, infant-parent bonding and experience of oral satisfactions. The facial skeleton is the most frequent site of involvement in hyperostosis, and dysphagia is a typical component, usually signaled by refusal of food and failure to thrive.
