A patient with infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH) is presented. Common features in all reported patients include: onset in the early part of the 1st year, tender swellings in more than one site and multiple scattered hyperostoses shown by radiography, but no previous study has determined the cause or origin of ICH. Biopsy of bony lesions only reveals hyperplasia of the lamellar cortical bone, without inflammation or subperiosteal haemorrhage. Although MRI resulted in excellent images for differentiation between bony and soft tissue structures and for evaluation of the extent of soft tissue involvement, it had no additional value in the management of the patient. Only in questionable cases can MRI provide additional information about the presence of a subperiosteal haemorrhage. Radiographic examination, in addition to clinical history and physical examination, is considered sufficient with regard to differential diagnosis and follow up of ICH.
