INTRODUCTION: The discovery of a jugular tumefaction in an infant evokes several diseases. We report the case of a 4-month-old infant whose jugular cellulite revealed mandibular osteomyelitis. CASE REPORT: A 4-month-old boy was referred for hard, hot tumefaction of the right cheek and multiple cervical adenopathies. The suggested diagnosis was cellulite of cutaneous origin. He presented 21 900/mm(3) hyperleukocytosis associated with an inflammatory biological syndrome. Standard x-ray of the facial mass was normal. Sonography of the face showed thickening of the soft subcutaneous tissues and retro and sub-mandibular adenopathies with abcedation. Antibiotherapy with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid led to rapid improvement. Three days after withdrawal of the antibiotherapy, the tumefaction recurred without fever. A facial scan eliminated cystic lymphangioma and showed osteolysis of the external plateau of the ascending branch of the mandible with periosteal appositions. Histological examination of a surgical bone biopsy showed infectious osteitis and culture revealed hemolytic beta streptococci. Six weeks of antibiotherapy (initially with amoxicillin and gentamycin, then amoxicillin in monotherapy) led to the regression of all cutaneous signs. COMMENTS: When confronted with a tumefaction in this area, malignant or benign tumoral causes such as cystic lymphangioma must be eliminated. Infectious causes (abscess, parotid inflammation and osteomyelitis) must be evoked and distinguished from infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey-Silverman's syndrome). Standard radiological imaging, scan or scintigraphy are useful diagnostic tools. If osteolysis is discovered, a biopsy must be taken for anatomopathological and biological examination.
