A boy, age 12 years, who had infantile cortical hyperostosis has continued to have occasional aches and new cortical thickenings in his arms and legs. His mandible is undergrown and his ribs have an abnormal slope. Recurrence of Caffey's cortical hyperostosis and persistent deformity have been observed in other children and young adults. Some unexplained cases of late cortical thickening and pain may be due to Caffey's disease.
