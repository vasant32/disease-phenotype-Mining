Two cases of infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffrey's disease) are presented. This syndrome is characterized by diaphyseal cortical swelling of flat bones as well as long bones, often polyostotic but sometimes confirmed to one bone, e.g. the mandible. Prominent clinical features are irritability and painful firm swelling of soft tissues, as well as pallor and subfebrile temperatures. Serological reactions and blood cultures are negative and histological findings are non-specific. Differential diagnosis should account for bone syphilis, hypervitaminosis A, battered child syndrome and osteomyelitis. The prognosis is favourable.
