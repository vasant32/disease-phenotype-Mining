Infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey disease) is characterized by radiological evidence of cortical hyperostosis, soft tissue swellings, fever and irritability. We report a case of Caffey disease highlighting its presentation with thrombocytosis and high serum immunoglobulin level to alert physicians to use steroids cautiously in view of the known thrombocythemic effect of the drug. Raised Immunoglobulin also suggests that this syndrome could be infectious in origin.
