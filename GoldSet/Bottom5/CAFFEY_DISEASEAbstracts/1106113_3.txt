Twenty-nine cases of infantile cortical hyperostosis with a wide range of bone involvement are reviewed. Soft tissue painful swellings began before roentgenographic changes appeared in the underlying bone. In 17 babies gradual involvement of different bones was noted. In seven cases lesions previously healed became reactivated. The disease is self-limiting and appears in a narrow age group. Mandibular involvement is most common. The clinical picture and laboratory data are reported. Differential diagnosis and possible etiological factors are discussed. The similarity of infantile cortical hyperostosis to extreme periosteal new bone formation in response to trauma in sensorily deprived children is suggested as a possible etiological factor.
