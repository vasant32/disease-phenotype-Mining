Infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey disease) is characterized by radiological evidence of cortical hyperostosis, soft tissue swellings, fever and irritability. We report a case of Caffey disease highlighting its presentation as pyrexia of unknown origin, appearance on radionuclide bone scintigraphy and our unsatisfactory experience of treating it with Ibuprofen, a prostaglandin inhibitor.
