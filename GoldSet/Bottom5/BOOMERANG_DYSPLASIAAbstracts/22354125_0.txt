Boomerang dysplasia is a rare lethal osteochondrodysplasia characterized by disorganized mineralization of the skeleton, leading to complete nonossification of some limb bones and vertebral elements, and a boomerang-like aspect to some of the long tubular bones. Like many short-limbed skeletal dysplasias with accompanying thoracic hypoplasia, the potential lethality of the phenotype can be difficult to ascertain prenatally. We report a case of boomerang dysplasia prenatally diagnosed by use of ultrasonography and 3D-CT imaging, and identified a novel mutation in the gene encoding the cytoskeletal protein filamin B (FLNB) postmortem. Findings that aided the radiological diagnosis of this condition in utero included absent ossification of two out of three long bones in each limb and elements of the vertebrae and a boomerang-like shape to the ulnae. The identified mutation is the third described for this disorder and is predicted to lead to amino acid substitution in the actin-binding domain of the filamin B molecule.
