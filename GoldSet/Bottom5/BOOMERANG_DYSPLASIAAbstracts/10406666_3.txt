The Museum Vrolik collection of human anatomy comprises 360 recently redescribed specimens with congenital anomalies. The specimen described here dated from 1881 and presented with a general embryonic appearance, disproportionate short stature, brachycephaly, widened cranial sutures, hypertelorism, microphthalmia, bilateral cleft lip and palate, micrognathia, short and curved limbs, polysyndactyly, and abnormal female genitalia. Conventional radiography was hampered by decalcification of the skeleton, due to acidification of the preservation fluid. The use of additional imaging techniques, i.e., mammography, computerized tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction, and magnetic resonance imaging eventually led us to conclude that the condition of our specimen was similar to Piepkorn type skeletal dysplasia, boomerang dysplasia, and a condition described by Carpenter and Hunter [1982: J Med Genet 19:311-315], though none of these diagnoses seemed fully applicable.
