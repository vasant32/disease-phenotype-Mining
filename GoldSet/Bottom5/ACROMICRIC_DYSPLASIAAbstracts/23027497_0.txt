Acromicric dysplasia is a skeletal dysplasia that is characterized by short stature, short hands and feet, typical facial dysmorphism, normal mental development, and characteristic hand radiology. Carpal tunnel syndrome may be seen in adults with acromicric dysplasia; however, to the authors' knowledge, it has not been reported in pediatric patients. This article describes a 9-year old boy with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and acromicric dysplasia treated operatively. No recurrences occurred during 1 year of postoperative follow-up.Carpal tunnel syndrome is a rare disease in childhood. The etiologic factors of carpal tunnel syndrome include trauma (especially distal radius epiphysealis), overuse, genetic or metabolic disorders, space-occupying lesions in the carpal tunnel, hemophilia, congenital anomalies, adverse effect of growth hormone replacement therapy, and idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome. Acromicric dysplasia should be considered in the etiology of childhood carpal tunnel syndrome.The surgical outcome of carpal tunnel syndrome is good with early diagnosis and treatment. However, in the case of skeletal dysplasia, the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome may be delayed due to anomalies of the hand and due to the child's difficulty in expressing symptoms. Because of the delay in diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome in patients with skeletal dysplasia, the treatment outcomes may not be promising. Electrophysiologic studies should be performed early when the clinical signs are positive.
