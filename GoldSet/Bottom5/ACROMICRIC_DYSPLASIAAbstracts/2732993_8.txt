Four unrelated patients are reported with short stature, stiffness of the joints, short fingers, inability to make a fist, and thickened skin on the forearms. Investigations have failed to show a lysosomal storage disorder and radiographs show non-specific changes with a delayed carpal bone age. The clinical features in the four children are very similar to the recently described acromicric dysplasia. There are also similarities to Moore-Federman syndrome which has only been described in one family. The case is made that acromicric dysplasia and Moore-Federman syndrome are the same entity.
