The triad of a camptodactyly, club feet, and cleft palate, called the Gordon syndrome, is a rare autosomal dominant trait with variable expressivity, known from only three previously described families. Here we report the condition in a mother and her daughter. They also had several previously undescribed anomalies, which suggests that the Gordon syndrome is a more complex malformation syndrome than previously suspected.
