We present a case of 6-year-old boy who developed severe hyperkalaemia and ventricular tachycardia after administration of succinylcholine. Ventricular tachycardia was defibrillated and Gordon syndrome, which was diagnosed subsequently, was treated successfully. Paediatric patients with underlying metabolic disorders such as Gordon syndrome are at high risk of developing severe hyperkalaemia after succinylcholine administration.
