A second family is described in which camptodactyly, club foot, and cleft palate (the Gordon syndrome) is transmitted in a pattern consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. Penetrance appears to be more reduced in females than in males, and cleft palate is the least frequently manifested trait.
