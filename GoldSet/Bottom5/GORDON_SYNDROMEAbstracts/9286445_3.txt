We report on an 8-year-old boy with clinical manifestations suggestive of a new arthrogryposis syndrome. These included characteristic craniofacial abnormalities, cleft palate, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, pulmonary hypoplasia, cryptorchidism, and unusual ophthalmological findings. There was no intrauterine growth retardation or decreased fetal movements. Despite the poor prognosis expected in early life, the patient presented with normal mental capability on follow-up. Family data showed that a maternal first cousin of the mother (mother's brother's son) had similar findings and died in infancy. Differential diagnosis included Pena-Shokeir syndrome or phenotype, Gordon syndrome, Marden-Walker syndrome, and the syndrome of arthrogryposis with ophthalmoplegia and retinopathy. The possibility of autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance is suggested for this apparently new syndrome.
