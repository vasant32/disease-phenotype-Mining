<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one severe case, treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> was associated with an alteration to negative calcium and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> balance, and faecal losses of calcium were particularly high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect persisted for at least three months after the steroids had been discontinued, and during this period there was pronounced retardation of linear growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six months after the treatment had been stopped mineral balance was again positive and there was rapid 'catch up' in growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In infancy, the negative effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> on calcium, <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> metabolism may contribute to inhibition of bone growth and steroid stunting </plain></SENT>
