<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case is atypical in that the patient presented with only a periosteal bone mass and a negative history of toothache, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, or trauma to the area </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Atypical cases of this nature cause diagnostic problems, and several <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> must be considered in a differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, which also occurs in this age group and may show cortical reduplication on radiographic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prognosis in cases of Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> is poor, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may occur in a matter of weeks </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>Osteogenic sarcoma</z:hpo>, which occurs in slightly older age groups but presents as a cortical expansion with facial deformity </plain></SENT>
