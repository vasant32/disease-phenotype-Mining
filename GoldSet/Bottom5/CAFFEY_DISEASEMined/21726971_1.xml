<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study seeks to present the characteristic patterns of prenatal-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> (PCH) with regard to the radiographic features, and tries to ascertain whether PCH is a separate entity from infantile cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), known as classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey Disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study identified cases with PCH based upon abnormal radiographic and chondro-osseous morphological and clinical findings, as available, from the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>Skeletal Dysplasia</z:hpo> Registry between 1987 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes and clinical information were also identified from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based upon radiographic results, we found 20 individuals with PCH, of whom 10 neonatally survived, and 10 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>Hyperostosis</z:hpo> of the mandible was found in 18/20, and of the skull base in 16/20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>Hyperostosis</z:hpo> of the ribs was found in 17/20 cases, of the scapulae in 14/20, and of the clavicles in 4/20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>Hyperostosis</z:hpo> of the ileum was found in 11/20 cases, and of the long bones in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20/20 cases, of which three cases had fibula sparing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> of the hands, feet, and spine was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, based upon clinical features and radiographic expression, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and PCH represent two separate entities, and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> should continue to be referred to as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey Disease</z:e> and that PCH should be called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings of symmetrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> of the mandible, ribs, scapulae, ilea, and long bones in any combination should suggest the diagnosis of PCH </plain></SENT>
