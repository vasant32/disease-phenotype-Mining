<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The parietal and frontal bones are rarely affected in infantile cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: Case n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1: A 14-day-old boy developed a swelling of the left eyelid that extended to the face in a few days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was tender and associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory findings were increased (RBC sedimentation rate and other signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT scan of the sinuses, soft tissues and bones was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but at the age of 23 days minimal patches of rarefaction were seen on X-rays of the frontal bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These lacunar areas gradually extended, with the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A new CT scan at 6 months of age confirmed the existence of lacunar areas in the skull, but failed to find any lesions of the mandibles or nasal bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At that time, scintigraphy showed inflammatory lesions of the skull and ribs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinical, laboratory and radiological findings spontaneously disappeared within 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Case n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>2: Similar swellings of the face developed at the age of 15 days in the brother of case n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The laboratory findings were identical to those for his brother, and there were minimal lytic areas of the vault of skull without any other lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At 3 months of age, X-rays confirmed the existence of skull lesions and showed cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> of the left humerus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Similar cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> of nasal bones appeared at the age of 8 months, while the inflammatory syndrome persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> findings gradually and spontaneously disappeared within 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> are usually most prominent in the lower extremities in cases of familial infantile cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The lesions were largely confined to the skull in our cases, with no lesions of the mandible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The disease was only identified in the first case after a protracted course with unpredictable remissions and relapses and the discovery of the cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> in his brother </plain></SENT>
