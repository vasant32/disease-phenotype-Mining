<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Infantile cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo>, also known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey's disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey</z:e>-Silverman syndrome, is an uncommon clinico-pathological lesion of unknown etiology and uncertain histogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the most striking features is the early age of patients at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease, showing swelling of the soft tissues overlaying bones, hyperirritability, and, subsequently, periosteal new bone production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The natural history of the disease proves to be self-limiting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple areas are involved in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These polyostic forms are easily clinically diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But in rare monostic presentations, especially manifestations in the scapular region, there may be a great suspicion of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologically, such lesion may also be misdiagnosed as a malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> because of the great variety of microscopic appearances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted into 5 cases (biopsies from one male and four female infants, 6 weeks to 4 months of age) to characterize the histological variability in the natural course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopical investigations were additionally performed on two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the process corresponds to typical ossifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periostitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three phases can be distinguished according to the main histological characteristics: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> inflammatory and proliferating phase; 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Osteogenic phase; 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Phase of remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The first phase is characterized by a loss of periost, areas showing proliferation of fibroblast-like cells, and by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> of surrounding musculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Infiltration by leucocytes was occasionally observed and was accompanied by micro-abscesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The osteogenic phase was characterized by formation of woven bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally proliferations of osteogenic mesenchyma were found and resulted in typical mineralization patterns with matrix vesicles and interfibrillar depositions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52254">hydroxyapatite</z:chebi> crystals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Calcification of mitochondria was also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Viruses could not be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Only thread-like structures were found in the nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>At first interpretation, they appeared to be pathological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_45'>protein depositions</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, further investigations will be necessary to elucidate their genesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Biopsy still remains indicated in cases of an unclear course of monostic disease </plain></SENT>
