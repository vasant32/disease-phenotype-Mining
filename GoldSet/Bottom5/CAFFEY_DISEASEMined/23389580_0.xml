<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Also named <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey disease</z:e>, infantile cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> that usually affects children of a few weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture is that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>, soft tissue swelling at various sites (mandible, clavicle, limbs) with local warmth, and pain on palpation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiographs demonstrate an important cortical thickening of the affected bony structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is generally spontaneous resolution of the inflammatory signs within the first few months or years of life, without future recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a recurrence in the adolescent period and conducted a thorough review of the literature to confirm this rare possibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report the case of a 12-year-old female patient, presenting symptoms of pain and swelling of both forearms and legs, similar to her initial clinical picture at 1 month of age when the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey disease</z:e> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis confirmed the COL1A1 mutation, the classic mutation described in the familial form of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiologic investigation revealed new periosteal bone formation of the right and left ulnae and the left fibula, suggesting a recurrence of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A thorough review of the literature was conducted, using the Medline database between 1948 and 2011, to confirm this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The literature confirms the possibility but also the rarity of a recurrence of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> in an adolescent who was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey disease</z:e> in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We have identified less than a dozen cases in the literature describing such a recurrence and in the majority there are no medical photographs or radiographs to support the clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our case is well documented both clinically and radiologically regarding the initial presentation and the recurrence in adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although very rare and poorly recognized, the diagnosis of recurrent cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> must be evoked in a patient who suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey disease</z:e> in infancy, and presents similar clinical characteristics in the adolescent period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V--case report </plain></SENT>
