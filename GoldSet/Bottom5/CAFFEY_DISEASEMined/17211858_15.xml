<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of missense mutations in the collagen type I triple helix affect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29947">glycine residues</z:chebi> in the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat, few nonglycine substitutions have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two arginine-to-cysteine substitutions in the alpha1(I)-collagen chain are associated with classic EDS [R134C (p.R312C)] or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey disease</z:e> with mild EDS features [R836C (p.R1014C)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show alpha1(I) R-to-C substitutions in three unrelated patients who developed iliac or femoral dissection in early adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, manifestations of classic EDS in Patient 1 [c.1053C&gt;T; R134C (p.R312C); X-position] or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> in Patients 2 [c.1839C&gt;T; R396C (p.R574C); Y-position] and 3 [c.3396C&gt;T; R915C (p.R1093C); Y-position] are seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dermal fibroblasts from the patients produced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-bonded alpha1(I)-dimers in approximately 20% of type I collagen, which were efficiently secreted into the medium in case of the R396C and R915C substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Theoretical stability calculations of the collagen type I heterotrimer and thermal denaturation curves of monomeric mutant alpha1(I)-collagen chains showed minor destabilization of the collagen helix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, dimers were shown to be highly unstable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The R134C and R396C caused delayed procollagen processing by N-proteinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural findings showed collagen fibrils with variable diameter and irregular interfibrillar spaces, suggesting disturbed collagen fibrillogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that R-to-C substitutions in the alpha1(I) chain may result in a phenotype with propensity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial rupture</z:e> in early adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This broadens the phenotypic range of nonglycine substitutions in collagen type I and has important implications for genetic counseling and follow-up of patients carrying this type of mutation </plain></SENT>
