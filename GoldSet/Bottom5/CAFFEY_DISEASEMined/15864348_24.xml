<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide screen for genetic linkage in a large family with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey disease</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) revealed a locus on chromosome 17q21 (LOD score, 6.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Affected individuals and obligate carriers were heterozygous for a missense mutation (3040Ctwo head right arrowT) in exon 41 of the gene encoding the alpha1(I) chain of type I collagen (COL1A1), altering residue 836 (R836C) in the triple-helical domain of this chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same mutation was identified in affected members of 2 unrelated, smaller families with <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, but not in 2 prenatal cases and not in more than 300 chromosomes from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast cultures from an affected individual produced abnormal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-bonded dimeric alpha1(I) chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dermal collagen fibrils of the same individual were larger, more variable in shape and size, and less densely packed than those in control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals bearing the mutation, whether they had experienced an episode of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> or not, had joint hyperlaxity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000974'>hyperextensible skin</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000023'>inguinal hernias</z:hpo> resembling symptoms of a mild form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268337" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EDS3">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings extend the spectrum of COL1A1-related diseases to include a hyperostotic disorder </plain></SENT>
