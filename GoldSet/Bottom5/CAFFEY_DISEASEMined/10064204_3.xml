<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two cases are presented of congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey's disease</z:e> in premature babies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first baby was hydropic at birth and had cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> involving the mandible and long bones of right upper limb and both lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second baby had cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> of the nasal bones causing severe nasal nonchoanal stenosis that needed surgery, in addition to involvement of long bones of the four extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both babies recovered from the disease and were discharged home well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases suggest that the improved outcome of congenital of infantile cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> may reflect improvement of neonatal mechanical ventilation and availability of neonatal total parenteral nutrition </plain></SENT>
