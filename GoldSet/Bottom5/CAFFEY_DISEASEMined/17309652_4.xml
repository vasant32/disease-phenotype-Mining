<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A heterozygous mutation for a 3040C--&gt;T in exon 41 of COL1A1 was found in affected individuals, further confirming the autosomal dominance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020497" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Caffey disease</z:e> that is caused by this particular mutation </plain></SENT>
