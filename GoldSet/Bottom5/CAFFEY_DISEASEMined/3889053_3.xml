<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides the classically described subperiosteal thickening, the present patient radiographically also had well-circumscribed intramedullary lytic lesions in both proximal tibial metaphyses, which subsequently disappeared in 3 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resolution of these lesions suggests they may be part of the radiological picture of infantile cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> and probably may be managed by observation </plain></SENT>
