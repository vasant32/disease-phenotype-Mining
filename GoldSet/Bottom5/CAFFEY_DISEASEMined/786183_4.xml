<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The genetic aspects of infantile cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pedigree is presented, based on the history and clinical and radiological investigations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> living members of the family, with data from 11 cases with the condition in two generations, and one possible case from a third generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> gene with varying expressivity could be responsible in this family and, though the genetic outlook is unfavourable, it is fully balanced by the benign character of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> form of infantile cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> affecting 2 girls and 1 boy in the family is described with a follow-up of 3 to 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no deterioration in the general state of health of the patients and no abnormality was detected in laboratory investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of the second year of life, curving of the long bones was usually present radiologically and the appositionless corticalis was paper thin with extended marrow cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With increasing age the bowing of the bones became less noticeable (but can be permanent in some cases), the corticalis thickened, while marrow cavity volume decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the marrow cavities the remains of insufficiently resorbed original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperostoses</z:e> were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the affected bones exhibited both numerous Park's stress lines and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, more marked in the bones of the lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even these changes disappeared with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither the metaphyses nor epiphyseal ossification centres were affected by the condition </plain></SENT>
