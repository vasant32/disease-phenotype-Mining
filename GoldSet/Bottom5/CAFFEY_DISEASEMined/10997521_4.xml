<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Calvarial hyperostotic syndrome clinically resembles canine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264082" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">craniomandibular osteopathy</z:e> (CMO) and human infantile cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100774'>hyperostosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), but it is unique in that there is progressive and often asymmetric skull bone involvement, and the population affected appears to be only young, male bullmastiff dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Characteristic radiographic findings consist of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002684'>thickening of the calvaria</z:hpo> with irregular, bony proliferation over the frontal, temporal, and occipital bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination shows that the trabeculae of the calvarial diploÃ« are thickened and contiguous with a sunburst-like pattern of subperiosteal trabeculae composed of woven and lamellar bone tissue, accompanied by loose fibrovascular tissue and a variable <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> comprised predominantly of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 80% of the cases presented, the lesion was self-limiting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The etiology remains unknown; however, traumatic, neoplastic, and degenerative conditions do not appear to be primary factors in the etiopathogenesis of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may be that this syndrome has a familial component, similar to that described for CMO and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
