<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The scintigraphic appearance of this relatively uncommon disease of children was similar to that obtained in multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> osseous lesions showed a marked uptake of both radiotracers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the distribution of abnormalities (mandible, scapulae) and the degree of extension (mainly diaphyseal) of the lesions are important characteristics in the scintigraphic differential diagnosis but bone radiographs are best used in making the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
