<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possibility of a common cause of both conditions was suggested by Hunter and Carpenter (Clin Genet 39(6): 471-480, 1991) in their report of a patient with apparent manifestations of both AT-I and Boomerang <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on a male fetus of 31 weeks gestation whose clinical, radiologic and histologic findings are compared to reported cases of AT-I, Boomerang <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and the patient of Hunter and Carpenter (Clin Genet 39(6): 471-480, 1991) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the documentation of clinical and radiologic findings we demonstrate overlap of AT-I and Boomerang <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in our patient, and, from histologic examination, suggest a defect of cartilage and bone formation as the basic abnormality in this lethal bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
