<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the cartilage contains irregular clusters that occasionally include giant chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002089'>Pulmonary hypoplasia</z:hpo> is a characteristic finding that has been presumed to be the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0002058'>neonatal lethality</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on a male fetus with AO1 and document the early ultrasonographic/ radiologic progression of this disorder from 15 weeks gestation until delivery at 41 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the radiological findings we describe are typical of AO1 by the lack of proximal and middle phalangeal ossification, the complete radiological picture showed considerable overlap with boomerang <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002089'>pulmonary hypoplasia</z:hpo> was present, it was moderate and considered unlikely to be the sole cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detailed neonatal and postmortem examination showed severe subglottic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002779'>tracheomalacia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The tracheal walls were supported by thin and pliable cartilaginous plates that allowed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> collapse with minimal pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The marked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002779'>tracheomalacia</z:hpo>, and temporal proximity of extubation to demise support tracheal collapse as a major contributor to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in AO1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The detailed description of this patient should contribute to earlier diagnosis of this condition; anticipation of the poor prognosis in AO1 is essential for appropriate genetic counseling of the parents and for determining postnatal treatment options </plain></SENT>
