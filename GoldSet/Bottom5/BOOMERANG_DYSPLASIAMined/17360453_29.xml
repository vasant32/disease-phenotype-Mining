<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in filamin B (FLNB), a gene encoding a cytoplasmic actin-binding protein, have been found in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorders</z:e>, including boomerang <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, spondylocarpotarsal syndrome, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175778" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Larsen syndrome</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="AOI">atelosteogenesis</z:e> phenotypes I and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the role of FLNB in vivo, we generated mice with a targeted disruption of Flnb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fewer than 3% of homozygous embryos reached term, indicating that Flnb is important in embryonic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous mutant mice were indistinguishable from their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flnb was ubiquitously expressed; strong expression was found in endothelial cells and chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flnb-deficient fibroblasts exhibited more disorganized formation of actin filaments and reduced ability to migrate compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flnb-deficient embryos exhibited impaired development of the microvasculature and skeletal system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The few Flnb-deficient mice that were born were very small and had severe skeletal malformations, including scoliotic and kyphotic spines, lack of intervertebral discs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>fusion of vertebral bodies</z:hpo>, and reduced hyaline matrix in extremities, thorax, and vertebrae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These mice died or had to be euthanized before 4 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the phenotypes of Flnb-deficient mice closely resemble those of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorders</z:e> with mutations in FLNB </plain></SENT>
