<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Like many short-limbed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> with accompanying <z:hpo ids='HP_0005257'>thoracic hypoplasia</z:hpo>, the potential <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> of the phenotype can be difficult to ascertain prenatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of boomerang <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> prenatally diagnosed by use of ultrasonography and 3D-CT imaging, and identified a novel mutation in the gene encoding the cytoskeletal protein filamin B (FLNB) postmortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings that aided the radiological diagnosis of this condition in utero included absent ossification of two out of three long bones in each limb and elements of the vertebrae and a boomerang-like shape to the ulnae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The identified mutation is the third described for this disorder and is predicted to lead to amino acid substitution in the actin-binding domain of the filamin B molecule </plain></SENT>
