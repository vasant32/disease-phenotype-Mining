<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A rapid and specific screening method for patients at risk of inherited disorders of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> metabolism is desirable because symptoms are varied and nonspecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a rapid and specific method for screening with use of liquid urine samples or urine-soaked filter paper strips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Reverse-phase HPLC was combined with electrospray ionization (ESI), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and detection performed by multiple reaction monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transitions and instrument settings were established for 17 purines or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39447">pyrimidines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stable-isotope-labeled reference compounds were used as internal standards when available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total analysis time of this method was 15 min, approximately one-third that of conventional HPLC with ultraviolet detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recoveries were 96-107% in urine with added analyte, with two exceptions (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>, 64%; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi>, 79%), and 89-110% in urine-soaked filter paper strips, with three exceptions (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>, 65%; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi>, 77%; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16964">5-hydroxymethyluracil</z:chebi>, 80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expected abnormalities were easily found in samples from patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26394">purine nucleoside</z:chebi> phosphorylase deficiency, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> transcarbamylase deficiency, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003570'>molybdenum cofactor deficiency</z:hpo>, adenylosuccinase deficiency, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268132" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HPLC-ESI MS/MS of urine allows rapid screening for disorders of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The filter paper strips offer the advantage of easy collection, transport, and storage of the urine samples </plain></SENT>
