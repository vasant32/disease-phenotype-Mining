<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anomalies predominated in the cerebral cortex, particularly in the anterior regions; they were less pronounced in thalamus and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observations suggest that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography may be a useful tool for the localization of the deleterious effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic diseases</z:e> and for the investigation of their pathophysiologic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
