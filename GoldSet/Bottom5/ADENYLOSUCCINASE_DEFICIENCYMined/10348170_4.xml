<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>S-<z:chebi fb="110" ids="16335">Ado</z:chebi> has been previously reported as normally undetectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children not suffering from this defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In present study, we employed solid-phase extraction and thin-layer chromatography for isolation of a compound with spectral and chromatographic characteristics identical to S-<z:chebi fb="110" ids="16335">Ado</z:chebi> from human CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high-performance liquid chromatography-negative-ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the isolated compound is S-<z:chebi fb="110" ids="16335">Ado</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We established the reference values of S-<z:chebi fb="110" ids="16335">Ado</z:chebi> in CSF of children (1.1+/-0.4 micromol/l; mean +/- S.D; n = 26) by means of reversed-phase HPLC method on a C18 column with UV detection </plain></SENT>
