<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparative analyses, using HPCE, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and an automated amino acid analyser, were carried out on urine and blood samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003131'>cystinuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003343'>glutathione synthetase deficiency</z:hpo> and adenylosuccinase deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HPCE of the sulphur-containing amino compounds, derivatized with monobromobimane and detected by fluorescence spectroscopy, was a quick and simple alternative to classical amino acid analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detection of the characteristic succinylpurines associated with adenylosuccinase defect was equally well achieved with HPLC and HPCE (absorbance detector) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Owing to the possible connection between deficiency of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> (2-amino-1-ethanesulphonic acid) in the heart and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, a simple HPCE method was developed for the determination of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> in sub-milligram samples of biopsies of the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The homologue 3-amino-1-propanesulphonic acid was the internal standard, and derivatives of 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate and fluorescence detection were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the potential of HPCE to analyse small volumes should be exploited in biomedicine and clinical diagnosis to analyse sub-milligram samples of tissue biopsies and cells </plain></SENT>
