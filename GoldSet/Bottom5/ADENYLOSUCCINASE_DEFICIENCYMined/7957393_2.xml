<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By comparing the amino acid pattern before and after hydrolysis, defects can be traced in the metabolism not only of amino acids but also of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purines</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, N-acetylated amino acids and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, and probably other compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This method has yielded important information such as the identification of two "new" diseases, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> transaminase deficiency and adenylosuccinase deficiency, and the discovery of a peculiar, acid-labile double peak in the CSF of patients with the transient neonatal hyperammonaemia syndrome and with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> cycle defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This substance was subsequently identified by others as gamma-glutamylglutamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, we strongly recommend incorporating of this approach in the investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with unclear <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
