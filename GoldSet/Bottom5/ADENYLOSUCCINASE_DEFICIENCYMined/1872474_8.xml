<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A radiochemical assay for adenylosuccinase, an enzyme which intervenes twice in the biosynthesis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two substrates of the enzyme, succinylaminoimidazole <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi> ribotide (SAICAR) and adenylosuccinate (S-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>), were synthesized in radioactive form by incubating [2,3-14C]fumarate and, respectively, AICAR and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> with partially purified adenylosuccinase from yeast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enzyme activities were determined by measuring the release of labeled fumarate after its separation from the substrate by chromatography on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53231">polyethyleneimine</z:chebi> thin-layer plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the activity of adenylosuccinase measured with SAICAR compared to that with S-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> was about 1 in crude extracts of rat liver and muscle and around 0.5 in human liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In rat and human liver, but not in rat muscle, 20 to 40% of both activities of adenylosuccinase were lost after freezing at -80 degrees C followed by thawing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the liver of patients with adenylosuccinase deficiency, in whom the deficiency had hitherto been measured only with S-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>, the activity of the enzyme toward S-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> and SAICAR was found to be lost in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is in accordance with the finding that both SAICA-riboside and succinyladenosine accumulate in adenylosuccinase-deficient patients </plain></SENT>
