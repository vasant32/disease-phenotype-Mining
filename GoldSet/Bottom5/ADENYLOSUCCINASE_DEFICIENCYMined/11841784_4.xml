<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, interest has increased in the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45506">alpha-D-ribose</z:chebi> (Rib) as a naturally occurring nutriceutical for enhancement of cardiac and muscular performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most likely the elevation of available PRPP, following Rib administration, plays a key role in the salvage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26386">purine nucleobases</z:chebi>, thus, accelerating the restitution of ATP pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, administration of Rib improves some of the neurological symptoms in patients with adenylosuccinase deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we show that rat brain extract can catalyze the Rib-mediated salvage of both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>, as well as the activation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> pro-drug, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results strongly support that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25901">pentose</z:chebi> may be converted to both PRPP and Rib1-P for the salvage of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most likely two-reaction pathway, composed of ribokinase and PRPP synthetase, is responsible of the PRPP formation, needed to salvage <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A two-reaction pathway, composed of ribokinase and phosphopentomutase, appears to be responsible of the Rib1-P formation, needed to salvage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> and to activate 5-FU to cytotoxic 5-FU-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26561">ribonucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>alpha-D-2'-Deoxyribose (deoxyRib) has a negligible effect on both the salvage of natural nucleobases to deoxyribonucleotides and on the activation of 5-FU to cytotoxic 5-FU-deoxynucleotides </plain></SENT>
