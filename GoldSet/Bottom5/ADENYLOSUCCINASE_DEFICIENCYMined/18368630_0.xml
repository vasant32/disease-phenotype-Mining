<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo>, frequently with autistic features and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ADSL deficiency may be diagnosed by detection of two abnormal metabolites in body fluids--succinyladenosine (S-<z:chebi fb="110" ids="16335">Ado</z:chebi>) and succinylaminoimidazole <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi> riboside (SAICAr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that the former metabolite is neurotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present clinical, biochemical and neuropathological findings of a child affected by a severe form of ADSL deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She had progressive neurological symptoms that started immediately after birth and died at 2.5 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Macroscopically the brain showed signs of moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grey matter structures showed widespread damage of neurons accompanied by microspongiosis of neuropile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral white matter showed lack of myelination in the centrum semiovale and diffuse spongiosis of neuropile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Myelination appropriate for the age was visible in posterior limb of internal capsule, in striatum, thalamus and in brain stem structures but diffuse destruction of myelin sheets was seen with severe marked astroglial reaction with signs of destruction of the cells and their processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural examination showed enormous destruction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cellular elements, but astonishingly mitochondria were relatively spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The neuropathological changes can be considered as the neurotoxic result of metabolic disturbances connected with adenylosuccinase deficiency </plain></SENT>
