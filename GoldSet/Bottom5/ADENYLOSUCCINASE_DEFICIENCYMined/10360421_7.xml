<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe here a procedure by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) for the direct analysis of urine samples on diagnostic metabolites, which are present in patient urine with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method was demonstrated using urine samples spiked with diagnostic metabolites, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi> transpeptidase deficiency, pyroglutamate for generalized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> deficiency, adenylosuccinate for adenylosuccinase deficiency, omithine for gyrate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, histidine for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010906'>histidinemia</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44747">homogentisic acid</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AKU">alcaptonuria</z:e>, at concentrations similar to those found in patients' urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A coaxial sheath liquid flow was used for coupling CE and MS in electrospray ionization mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Identification of the metabolites is based on their molecular weights and fragmentation patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CE-MS method is highly specific and sensitive comparing to the previously reported method using migration time and UV absorption for identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It should find broad application in clinical and pharmaceutical research and development </plain></SENT>
