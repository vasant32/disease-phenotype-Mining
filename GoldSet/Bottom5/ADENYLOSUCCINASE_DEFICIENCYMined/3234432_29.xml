<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This newly discovered inborn error of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> metabolism is characterized by an accumulation in body fluids of succinyladenosine (S-<z:chebi fb="110" ids="16335">Ado</z:chebi>) and succinylaminoimidazole <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi> riboside (SAICA riboside), the dephosphorylated derivatives of the two substrates of adenylosuccinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six living children (three boys and three girls) and one deceased sibling displayed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> was documented in five cases, autistic features in three, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> associated with muscular <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> in a brother and sister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and urine of these patients, the S-<z:chebi fb="110" ids="16335">Ado</z:chebi>/SAICA riboside ratio was between 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In striking contrast, the eighth patient (a girl) was markedly less mentally retarded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most noteworthy, the S-<z:chebi fb="110" ids="16335">Ado</z:chebi>/SAICA riboside ratio in her body fluids was around 5, suggesting that her milder <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo> was causally linked to this higher ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adenylosuccinase deficiency was demonstrated in the liver of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven living children, in the kidney of three patients in whom the enzymatic activity was measured, and in the muscle of three patients, including the two with muscular <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In fibroblasts of the six severely retarded patients, adenylosuccinase activity was reduced to approximately 40% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; in the patient with the higher S-<z:chebi fb="110" ids="16335">Ado</z:chebi>/SAICA riboside ratio, it reached only 6% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of adenylosuccinase deficiency justifies systematic screening for the enzyme defect in unexplained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
