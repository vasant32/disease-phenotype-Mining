Oral supplementation of 10 mmol/kg/day of D-ribose to a patient with an inherited deficit of adenylosuccinase, severe psychomotor retardation, and epilepsy caused a marked increase in plasma concentration and urinary excretion of urate, while minor changes in succinylpurine levels were observed. D-Ribose administration was accompanied by a slight improvement of behaviour and a progressive reduction of seizure frequency, which increased dramatically upon two attempts to withdraw the drug. Substitution of D-ribose with an equivalent amount of D-glucose did not result in an increase of seizure frequency.
