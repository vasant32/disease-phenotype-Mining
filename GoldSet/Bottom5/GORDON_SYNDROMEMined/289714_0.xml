<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>"Outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo>" is a new clinical syndrome in which high serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels (SK) are found in the outpatient condition returning toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> without any specific treatment after admission to the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here of six patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> of various origin (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001970'>interstitial nephritis</z:hpo>, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, Gordon syndrome) in whom dietary and postural factors were found to be responsible for the outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Na content of the "ad libitum" outpatient diet was definitely higher than that of the regular hospital diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increasing the Na intake from 120 mEq to 300 mEq induced a marked elevation of SK (from 5.21 +/- 0.16 to 6.34 +/- 0.40 mEq/l; p less than 0.001) in two hospitalized, recombent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, Na restriction induced a dramatic improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> (from 5.89 +/- 0.11 mEq/l to 4.79 +/- 0.08 mEq/l:; p less than 0.001) in 4 patients in whom the effect was studied in the outpatient state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the mean plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> (PA) was significantly lower in the patient group than in the healthy group, during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Na intake there was a considerable overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A clearer distintion was made by using the new index of PA per SK ratio expressing the diminution in the apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PA when related to the abnormally high SK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During high Na intake, PA was definitely suppressed and during Na restriction there was a dramatic relief from suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present studies confirmed the previously described phenomenon of "upright <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo>" which may have played an additional role in the development of outpatient elevation of SK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The knowledge of the clinical syndrome of "outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo>" may be important to single out certain cases of easily correctable insufficient (suppressed) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
