<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Familial hyperkalaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (FHH), also called <z:hpo ids='HP_0008242'>pseudohypoaldosteronism</z:hpo> type II (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PHA2</z:e>) or Gordon syndrome, is a rare Mendelian-form of low-renin <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first cases of FHH were reported approximately 30 years ago and they described the peculiar biochemical abnormalities (i.e. hyperkalaemia and hyperchloraemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> despite a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glomerular filtration rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since then, more than 90 single cases and families have been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These various reports show marked differences in phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our group has now collected 14 unrelated pedigrees originating from different parts of France and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We confirm the large variations in the age of discovery and in the severity of the biochemical abnormalities from one individual to another and from one family to another one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure levels have no significant relationship with hyperkalaemia or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085679" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperchloraemia</z:e>, but there is a positive relationship with age, as in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analyses of clinical features and Mendelian segregation in our families demonstrate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant inheritance</z:hpo>, as expected from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Efforts have been made in the past years to unravel the gene responsible for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Until now, a primary responsibility of the gene encoding the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi>-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (SLC12A3) has been excluded in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PHA2</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Three loci have been identified on chromosomes 1 (PHA2A), 17 (PHA2B) and 12 (PHA2C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>More recently, analysis of three additional pedigrees, including 10 affected subjects, with over 25 members allowed us to demonstrate further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> and the existence of at least a fourth locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this syndrome, and thus the variety of molecular defects, suggests the role of either several new components of the same pathway, multiple <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi>- regulated effectors or direct or indirect partners of the Na-Cl cotransporter </plain></SENT>
