<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OSR1 and SPAK are key regulators of NKCCs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>/2Cl(-) cotransporters) and activated by WNK family members (with-no-lysine kinase), mutations of which are known to cause Gordon syndrome, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> form of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of OSR1 kinase domain has been solved at 2.25 A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OSR1 forms a domain-swapped dimer in an inactive conformation, in which P+1 loop and alphaEF helix are swapped between dimer-related monomers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structural alignment with nonswapped Ste20 TAO2 kinase indicates that the integrity of chemical interactions in the kinase domain is well preserved in the domain-swapped interfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The OSR1 kinase domain has now been added to a growing list of domain-swapped protein kinases recently reported, suggesting that the domain-swapping event provides an additional layer of complexity in regulating protein kinase activity </plain></SENT>
