<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regulation of NCCT expression involves a scaffold of proteins composed of several kinases, including the third member of the WNK kinase family, WNK3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This protein, expressed in several tissues including kidney and brain, displays splice variation around exons 18 and 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We expressed these proteins in Xenopus oocytes and found that the renal isoform of WNK3 increased but the brain isoform decreased NCCT expression and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Introduction of a kinase-inactivating mutation into renal WNK3 reversed its action on NCCT, and the same mutation in the brain isoforms led to loss of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also studied the effect of phosphorylation of a key NCCT threonine (T58) on the effects of WNK3/4 coexpression; NCCT mutants with a T58A or T58D substitution had the same surface expression as T58 but had significantly altered transporter activity; however, both isoforms of WNK3 as well as WNK4 still modulated expression of these NCCT mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, experiments using kinase-dead STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK), a putative downstream target for WNKs, revealed that brain WNK3 acts in tandem with SPAK, whereas renal WNK3 seems to upregulate NCCT through a SPAK-independent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that the C-terminal motifs contributed by exons 18 and 22 play an important role in the actions of WNK3 isoforms on NCCT </plain></SENT>
