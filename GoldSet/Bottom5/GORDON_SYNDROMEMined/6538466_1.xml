<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are also semantic difficulties as the non-specific term "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis</z:hpo>" is often used for any individual with congenital limitation of joint movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many distinct syndromes present in this way and as they differ in their course, prognosis and genetic implications, diagnostic precision is crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A diagnostic analysis is given of 247 South African patients in whom "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis</z:hpo>" had been recorded, and the pathogenesis and nosology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002803'>congenital contractures</z:hpo> are discussed in this paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001387'>stiff joint</z:hpo> conditions were originally described in South African patients, i.e. Liebenberg <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> syndrome, digitotalar dysmorphism, and the Gordon syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003807'>camptodactyly</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001762'>club feet</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
