<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intronic deletions in the encoding gene cause Gordon syndrome, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo>, hypertensive, hyperkalemic disorder particularly responsive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>, a first-line treatment in essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the novel WNK1 BP control pathway active in distal nephron, WNK1 expression in mouse was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that WNK1 is highly expressed in testis &gt; heart, lung, kidney, placenta &gt; skeletal muscle, brain, and widely at low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several WNK1 transcript classes are demonstrated, showing tissue-, developmental-, and nephron-segment-specific expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, in kidney, the most prominent transcripts are smaller than elsewhere, having the first four exons replaced by an alternative 5'-exon, deleting the kinase domain, and showing strong distal nephron expression, whereas larger transcripts show low-level widespread distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alternative splicing of exons 11 and 12 is prominent-for example, transcripts containing exon 11 are abundant in neural tissues, testis, and secondary renal transcripts but are predominantly absent in placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional diversity generated by these events would produce proteins greatly differing in both structure and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings help further define and clarify the role of WNK1 and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi>-responsive pathway relevant to essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in which it participates </plain></SENT>
