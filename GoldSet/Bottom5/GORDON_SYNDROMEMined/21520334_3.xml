<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>WNK1 and WNK4 conserved noncoding regions were targeted to polymorphism screening using DHPLC and DGGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The scan identified an undescribed polymorphic AluYb8 insertion in WNK1 intron 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Screening in primates revealed that this Alu-insertion has probably occurred in human lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping in 18 populations from Europe, Asia, and Africa (n = 854) indicated an expansion of the WNK1 AluYb8 bearing chromosomes out of Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency in Sub-Saharan Africa was ~3.3 times lower than in other populations (4.8 vs. 15.8%; P = 9.7 × 10(-9) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis across three European sample sets (n = 3,494; HYPEST, Estonians; BRIGHT, the British; CADCZ, Czech) detected significant association of the WNK1 AluYb8 insertion with blood pressure (BP; systolic BP, P = 4.03 × 10(-3) , effect 1.12; diastolic BP, P = 1.21 × 10(-2) , effect 0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gender-stratified analysis revealed that this effect might be female-specific (n = 2,088; SBP, P = 1.99 × 10(-3) , effect 1.59; <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> P = 3.64 × 10(-4) , effect 1.23; resistant to Bonferroni correction), whereas no statistical support was identified for the association with male BP (n = 1,406) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In leucocytes, the expressional proportions of the full-length WNK1 transcript and the splice-form skipping exon 11 were significantly shifted in AluYb8 carriers compared to noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The WNK1 AluYb8 insertion might affect human BP via altering the profile of alternatively spliced transcripts </plain></SENT>
