<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The novel serine/threonine kinases (with no lysine kinases or WNKs), WNK1 and WNK4, are encoded by the disease genes for Gordon syndrome (PRKWNK1 and PRKWNK4), a rare monogenic syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These proteins alter the expression of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi>-sensitive Na/Cl cotransporter (NCCT) in Xenopus laevis oocytes, although the details are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here our own experience and confirm that kinase-dead WNK4 (318D&gt;A) is unable to affect <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> fluxes through the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi>-sensitive Na/Cl transporter (NCCT) or its membrane expression as an ECFP-NCCT fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the kinase domain is not sufficient for a functional WNK4 since deletion of the acidic motif (a motif unique to WNK family members) completely abolishes functional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi> terminal of WNK4 (1-620) containing the kinase domain and acidic motif retains full activity, but does not interact directly with NCCT in pull-down assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coexpression of WNK1 antagonizes the action of WNK4, and kinase-dead WNK1 (368D&gt;A) or WNK1 carrying a WNK4 disease mutation (565Q&gt;E) behaves in the same way as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> WNK1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests kinase activity and charge conservation within the acidic motif are not essential for the WNK1-WNK4 interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also report that WNK4 probably reduces surface expression largely through an effect on forward trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, the effect of WNK4 on NCCT expression is mimicked by dynamin, but the dominant-negative K44A dynamin mutant does not block the action of WNK4 itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results further highlight important differences in the mechanism by which WNK kinases affect expression of NCCT vs. other membrane proteins such as ROMK </plain></SENT>
