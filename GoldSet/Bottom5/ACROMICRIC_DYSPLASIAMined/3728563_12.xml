<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a new type of bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the "acromicric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>," based on the study of six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is characterized clinically by mild facial anomalies, markedly shortened hands and feet, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> that is severe in most of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Roentgenograms of the hands are characteristic: the metacarpals and the phalanges are short and stubby, the proximal portion of the last four metacarpals are slightly pointed with an external notch on the 2nd metacarpal and an internal notch on the 5th metacarpal, similar to pseudo-epiphysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The shape of the epiphysis and the metaphysis of the long bones is almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, except for a slight deformation of the femoral heads in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No signs of visceral storage were found, which rules out geleophysic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histological, histochemical, and electron microscopical examination of the growth cartilage in two cases showed similar lesions: disorganization of the growth zone with islands of cells, some of them degenerated; abnormal organization of collagen forming thick rims around the cells and wide fibers in the interterritorial matrix; large accumulation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> in most chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both sexes are affected; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>isolated cases</z:hpo> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> families </plain></SENT>
