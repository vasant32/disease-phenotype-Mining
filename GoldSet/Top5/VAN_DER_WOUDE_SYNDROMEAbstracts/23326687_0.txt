Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is usually underreported and frequently not diagnosed. The phenomenon that cleft lip and palate are regularly combined in the same pedigree makes it unique. A meticulous examination of a patient with lip pits may reveal a hidden form of a cleft, for example, submucous. This paper presents a case of VWS in a ten-year-old boy with characteristic orofacial features. Special emphasis has also been given on the need for appropriate genetic counseling.
