Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal dominant craniofacial disorder characterized by lip pits, clefting of the primary or secondary palate, and hypodontia. The gene has been localized, by RFLP-based linkage studies, to region 1q32-41 between D1S65-REN and D1S65-TGFB2. In this study we report the linkage analysis of 15 VWS families, using 18 microsatellite markers. Multipoint linkage analysis places the gene, with significant odds of 2,344:1, in a 4.1-cM interval flanked by D1S245 and D1S414. Two-point linkage analysis demonstrates close linkage of VWS with D1S205 (lod score [Z] = 24.41 at theta = .00) and with D1S491 (Z = 21.23 at theta = .00). The results revise the previous assignment of the VWS locus and show in an integrated map of the region 1q32-42 that the VWS gene resides more distally than previously suggested. When information about heterozygosity of the closely linked marker D1S491 in the affected members of the VWS family with a microdeletion is taken into account, the VWS critical region can be further narrowed, to the 3.6-cM interval between D1S491 and D1S414.
