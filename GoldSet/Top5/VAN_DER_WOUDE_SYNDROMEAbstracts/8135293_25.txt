We report on a 13 1/2-year-old patient with Kabuki make-up syndrome and complete idiopathic precocious puberty manifested at 7 1/2 years. In addition to the other specific clinical signs, she showed hypodontia and lower lip pits, as typically seen in the Van der Woude syndrome. The significance of lower lip pits in the Kabuki make-up syndrome is discussed.
