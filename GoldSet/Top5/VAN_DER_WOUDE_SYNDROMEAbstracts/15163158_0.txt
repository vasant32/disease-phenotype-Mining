Van der Woude syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant condition with high penetrance and variable expression. It consists of a cleft lip and/or palate pits on the vermilion of the lower lip, and hypodontia. Two cases of congenital lip pits with cleft lip and alveolus and an isolated cleft palate are described to illustrate the variable presentation of the clinical features and the importance of early recognition of Van der Woude syndrome because of the genetic implications.
