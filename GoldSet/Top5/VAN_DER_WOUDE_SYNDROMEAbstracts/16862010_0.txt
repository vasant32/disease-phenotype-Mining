We present 2 contrasting cases of congenital interalveolar synechiae. The first occurred in the setting of Van der Woude syndrome and was associated with a cleft palate. In the second case, it was an isolated abnormality and there was no contributory family history or syndromic associations. We review the literature on interalveolar synechiae and discuss its management, implications, and genetics. Interalveolar synechiae is a condition with an excellent prognosis; its presence necessitates careful examination for associated abnormalities and syndromes.
