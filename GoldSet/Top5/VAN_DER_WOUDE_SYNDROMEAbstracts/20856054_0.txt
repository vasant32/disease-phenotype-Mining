Orofacial clefting is a common condition found in 1 per 700 to 1 per 1000 births. Although most cases are isolated, a subset is caused by a specific genetic mutation. Specific gene tests have been used for recognizable syndromes such as velocardiofacial syndrome or van der Woude syndrome, where the cleft is associated with other anomalies. However, many cleft lip and palate patients have other anomalies but do not fit in to a recognizable syndrome. For these patients, chromosome analysis has been a first-line genetic test; however, in the past few years, a new form of genetic testing has become available for these patients: array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH). We present a 7-month-old male infant with cleft palate, developmental delay, and a family history of velopharyngeal insufficiency in whom aCGH array was used to identify a small deletion on the short (p) arm of chromosome 7. This defect, which was also found in the mother, was undetected by chromosome analysis. In summary, this case demonstrates that aCGH is a new diagnostic tool that is useful in the evaluation of select cases of orofacial clefting. Array comparative genome hybridization should be considered when the suspicion for a genetic etiology of the clefting remains strong despite a normal cytogenetic analysis.
