 INTRODUCTION: Congenital maxillomandibular fusion is a very rare condition with few cases reported. Cases of combinations of bony or soft tissue adhesions between the mandible and maxilla with cleft of the lip or palate, aglossia, popliteal pterygium and van der Woude syndrome have been reported. CASE REPORT: The aim of this paper is to report a case of fibrous maxillomandibular fusion of the jaws, with synechiae of buccal mucosa and the gingivae, which was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial team of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana soon after delivery. Separation of the fusion was done under nitrous oxide/oxygen sedation. Cleft of the hard palate was discovered during surgery. CONCLUSION: Maxillomandibular syngnathia is considered rare and synechiae with other maxillofacial abnormalities without syngnathia could exist and should not be ruled out. This report adds more information to the literature, by reporting a baby with synechiae and a cleft of the palate. Prompt, definitive diagnosis and management of other abnormalities in the baby could only be done under deep sedation. This was necessary to avoid deformity and early death.
