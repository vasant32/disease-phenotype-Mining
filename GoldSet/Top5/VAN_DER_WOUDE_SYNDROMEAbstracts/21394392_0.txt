The objective of the present study was to evaluate the glands of wall of congenital fistulae of the lower lip with the transmission electron microscope in order to characterize their microstructural pattern. Thin section of Araldite resin embedded congenital fistulae of the lower lip of four patients with Van der Woude syndrome from the Hospital de Reabilitação de Anomalias Craniofaciais da Universidade de São Paulo, Bauru, SP, were analyzed with a transmission electron microscope. The results showed that the glands were mostly made by typical mucous acini exhibiting, with certain frequency, myoepithelial cells surrounding them. In some of lobules, a few acini smaller than the typical mucous, showed granules of moderate electron density or containing a dense core or exhibiting small dense spherule and predominance granular material. These granules resemble to described recently by others in various human minor salivary glands. We concluded that glands associated with congenital fistula of lower lip of patients with Van der Woude syndrome, in spite of being located in vermilion border of the lip, showed at the transmission electron microscope characteristics of labial minor salivary gland, i.e, are mostly mucous with a few seromucous units, while typical seromucous demilunes are not present.
