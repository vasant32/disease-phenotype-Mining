Mutations in IRF6 cause Van der Woude syndrome (VWS), one of the most common syndromes associated with cleft lip (CL) with or without cleft palate (CP). The presence of pits on the lower lip of patients is the most characteristic feature of the syndrome. We have identified three novel and seven previously reported IRF6 mutations in 12 of 16 unrelated families segregating VWS from Pakistan. The three newly identified mutations include a frameshift (c.568delG) and two missense mutations c.295G>A (p.G99S) and c.1219T>C (p.S407P). Recent functional studies on IRF6 and the three-dimensional structure of IRF5 carboxy (C) terminus, a protein encoded by a paralog of IRF6, shed light on the p.S407P substitution. Additionally, the identification of the same mutations responsible for VWS in Pakistan, as reported in other global populations worldwide, marks these residues as mutational hotspots and indicates their essential role in structural stability or function of IRF6. This is the first study of VWS in Pakistan and we estimate that 1 in 100 patients with CL with or without CP (CL/P) are affected in the Pakistani population predominantly from the Punjab area.
