CENPE and CENPF are human kinetochore proteins of 312 and approximately 400 kDa, respectively. As part of an effort to characterize the functions of these two proteins, we have used their respective cDNAs to map their human chromosomal locations by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The gene that encodes CENPE, a kinetochore-associated motor protein that is postulated to segregate chromosomes during mitosis, maps to chromosome 4q24-->q25. The CENPF gene, which encodes a structural protein of the kinetochore, maps to chromosome 1q32-->q41 within close proximity to the genetic locus that is linked to Van der Woude syndrome.
