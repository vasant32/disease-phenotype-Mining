Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal-dominant oral facial disorder. To find a gene mutation in a Japanese family using fingernail DNA samples, we performed this study. We hypothesized that a gene mutation in IRF6 might be involved in VWS, and that fingernail DNA samples may be valuable for detecting such mutations. Linkage and haplotype analyses of the family mapped the disease locus to the 1q32-q41 region. Mutation analysis with an improved extraction method for fingernail DNA detected a novel missense mutation (1046A>T, E349V) in exon 7 of IRF6 in all the affected members of the family. Since the E349V change may disturb the hydrophobic core and affect regulatory activity of IRF6, it is most likely that the mutation is causative for VWS in this family. Fingernail DNA is thus useful for linkage and mutation analyses, since the fingernail can be easily obtained non-invasively, sent through the mail, and stored for a long period. We emphasize here the usefulness of fingernail DNA for the genetic analysis of a disease.
