Three patients with lip pits among 701 cases (0.43%) with clefts were treated in Beijing Stomatological Hospital in last five years. Genetic analysis of cases in 5 families with Van der Woude syndrome (Lip pits, cleft lip and cleft palate) in China was studied. We report on three unrelated families from the Beijing area, other three families from the Hebei, Heilongjang, Gansu province, in which the autosomal dominant gene for Van der Woude syndrome is segregating. All three or one of the clinical features may occur in an affected individual who carries the gene. Two probands had ankyloglossia. Six members were missing upper lateral incisors. One proband was missing second premolars. Six members were cross-bite. Two probands had congenital fistula of the mouth angle.
