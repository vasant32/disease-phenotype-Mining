Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal dominant craniofacial disorder characterized by pits of the lower lip, hypodontia and cleft lip and/or cleft palate. It has been reported as the most common form of syndromic orofacial clefting with very high penetrance and varied expressivity. The disease locus for VWS has been mapped to chomosome 1q32, but the gene is yet to be cloned. Here we report a total of 11 Swedish VWS patients: 9 familial cases from two families and two isolated cases. Clinical examination of these patients showed phenotypic variability, even between patients from the same family. Genetic studies were performed using four microsatellite markers from chromosome 1q32. Constitutional deletion in this region was not demonstrated in any of the familial or isolated cases. However, in the two VWS families, linkage analysis using these markers showed positive LOD (logarithm of the odds) scores ranging from 2.56 to 2.88 to all individual markers. The highest LOD score of 3.75 was obtained with the combined haplotypes of D1S491 and D1S205, thus confirming linkage of VWS in these two families to 1q32. We conclude that there is varied expressivity but no evidence of genetic heterogeneity in VWS.
