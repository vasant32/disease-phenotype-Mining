The Van der Woude syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant developmental malformation usually associated with bilateral lower lip pits. These congenital lip pits appear clinically as a malformation in the vermilion border of the lip, with or without excretion. As a genetic defect has been identified as a microdeletion of chromosome bands 1q32-q41, genetic counselling of patients may be considered. A nonsense mutation in the interferon regulatory factor-6 (IRF-6) is discussed as a pathogenic relevant factor. Therapeutic intervention is generally not necessary, although surgical excision is especially indicated in patients with recurrent inflammation. Physicians should be aware of the Van der Woude syndrome because it has been reported to be associated with a variety of malformations or other congenital disorders.
