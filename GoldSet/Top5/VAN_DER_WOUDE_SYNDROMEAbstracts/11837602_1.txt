Report of two cases with Van der Woude syndrome: a child and her mother: Congenital pits of the lower lip are rare malformations. They are closely associated with cleft lip (CL), cleft lip/palate (CL/CP) or isolated cleft palate (CP) and if so this condition is known as Van der Woude syndrome, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with high penetrance. Two individuals, one with lower lip pits and cleft palate and the other with isolated lower lip pit from the same family are described. Autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance was observed in this family and treatment consisted of complete removal of sinus tracts in one patient. Pathological features of sinus tracts consisted of stratified nonkeratinized squamous epithelium and a lamina propria of dense connective tissue. Importance of genetic counseling is emphasized as at least half of gene carriers have some kind of clefting.
