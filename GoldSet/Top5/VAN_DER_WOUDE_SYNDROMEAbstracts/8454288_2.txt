Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with one or more of the following features: clefting of the primary or secondary palate, hypodontia or lower lip pits. It has been estimated to account for 2% of all cases of cleft lip and palate. VWS is one of the rare disorders in which clefting of the primary and secondary palate may be seen to segregate as components associated with the same gene. Because of its autosomal dominant inheritance, VWS is readily accessable to linkage analysis as a preliminary step in the identification of the molecular abnormality underlying the clefting effect in the primary and secondary palate. A reported linkage between REN and VWS has promoted us to use pHRnX3.6 (REN) and several markers surrounding REN for a linkage analysis in a large Swiss family. In a second step, linkage analysis was performed to study restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the candidate gene TGFB2 and other loci recently mapped to the candidate region 1q32-1q41. Evidence for linkage (theta = 0.00, lod score = 3.01) between REN and VWS could be confirmed in this pedigree. TGFB2 demonstrated recombination with the disease locus and is unlikely to be causative in VWS. The results of a multipoint linkage analysis showed that VWS was flanked by D1S65 and TGFB2 at a maximum location score of 20.3.
