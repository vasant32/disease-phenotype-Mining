OBJECTIVE: To report a newborn with van der Woude syndrome, Pierre Robin sequence, and oral synechiae. Pierre Robin sequence is a rare manifestation of van der Woude syndrome as are oral synechiae. We speculate that the oral synechiae may be causally related to the development of Pierre Robin sequence in this patient.
