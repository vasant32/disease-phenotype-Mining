Cleft lip or palate and lower lip pits are typical features of the autosomal dominantly inherited Van der Woude syndrome. Limb defects have not been reported in this syndrome so far. A girl with a unilateral complete cleft lip and palate, bilateral lower lip pits, and amniotic deformities of all four limbs is reported and the possibility of chance occurrence of cleft lip and palate, lower lip pits, and limb defects is discussed.
