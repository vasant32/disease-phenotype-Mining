This article presents a treatment strategy for early release of interalveolar synechiae, aiming to facilitate early oral feeding and prevent temporomandibular joint ankylosis.The treatment results of 2 patients with van der Woude syndrome were retrospectively studied. Both patients underwent early surgical release of interalveolar synechiae under general anesthesia through fiberscopic nasal intubation. The 2 patients were treated at the ages of 6 and 14 days, respectively. The interincisival distances increased from 5 and 6 mm preoperatively to 11 and 10 mm immediately after surgery. This was increased further to 25 and 20 mm at long-term follow-up (6 and 24 months).In conclusion, synechiae between the upper and lower jaws can be safely treated at a very early age under general anesthesia with fiberscopic nasotracheal intubation. The purpose of early intervention in these cases is to facilitate oral feeding and prevent temporomandibular joint ankylosis.
