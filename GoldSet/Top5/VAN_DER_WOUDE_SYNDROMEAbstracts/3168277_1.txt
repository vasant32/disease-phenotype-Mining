A family with Van der Woude syndrome is described. The proband, whose mother and brother had facial clefting, showed inconspicuous abnormalities of the lower lip and a bifid uvula. Lesser expressions of Van der Woude syndrome are common and should be actively looked for in counseling families about cleft lip or cleft lip and palate.
