 OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the IRF6 gene in Van der Woude syndrome cases from an Indian population. SUBJECTS: Nine affected and four unaffected individuals from seven families with Van der Woude syndrome as well as five normal controls (with no history of Van der Woude or any other congenital malformation and belonging to the same geographical area as the families with Van der Woude syndrome). METHOD: Direct sequencing of all coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of the IRF6 gene. RESULTS: Five novel variants: IVS1+3900 A>G, 191 T>C, IVS4+775 C>T, IVS8+218 C>T, 1511 T>A (Ser 416 Arg) and two known variants: IVS6+27 C>G, 1083 G>A (V274I) were detected. Except for one, all were in noncoding regions either in 3'UTR or in introns. There was only one mutation in the coding region, detected in a normal control. CONCLUSION: The present report indicates that point mutations in the coding region of the IRF6 gene may not be a major cause of Van der Woude syndrome in Indian populations.
