Elimination of cosmetic deformity of lower lip pits and lower lip protrusion is the most common indication for lower lip repair in Van der Woude syndrome. 34 patients with lower lip pits that were operated on between 1982 and 2006 were reviewed. Surgical correction was performed with one of three different techniques: simple excision, vertical wedge resection, or inverted-T lip reduction. The aesthetic results were evaluated by two groups of raters. One group consisted of 10 medical professionals, and the other 10 lay people. A rating scheme was utilized, with a score of 3 for good, 2 for fair, and 1 for poor results. The final results were compared based on the mean score for each patient and inter-rater reliability was assessed using a weighted kappa coefficient. There was a fair agreement on the ratings between raters within groups. Inverted-T lip reduction received the best aesthetic result score from both groups of evaluators, with a mean score of 2.38±0.30 in the professional group, and 2.43±0.29 in the lay group. The results conclude that inverted-T lip reduction is a simple, safe and effective technique that achieves a better aesthetic result in lower lip repair of Van der Woude syndrome.
