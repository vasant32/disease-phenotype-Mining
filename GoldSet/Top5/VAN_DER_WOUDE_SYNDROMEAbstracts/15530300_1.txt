The Van der Woude syndrome is a rare autosomal-dominant condition typically comprising cleft lip or cleft palate and distinctive pits of the lower lips. The degree to which individuals carrying the gene are affected varies widely, even within families. The variable manifestations include lip pits alone, absent teeth, and isolated cleft lip and palate of varying degrees of severity. Other associated anomalies have also been described. We report a case of Van der Woud syndrome manifesting with isolated lower lip pits in an adolescent female with similarly affected family members.
