 OBJECTIVE: To identify mutations of interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene in Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) patients in China. METHODS: Three Chinese VWS families were screened to IRF6 gene mutation via PCR and sequence techniques. After amplification of exons 1-8 and their flanking splice junctions and part of exon 9 of the IRF6 gene by polymerase chain reaction, mutations were detected by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Three novel mutations, one in each family, were identified in all the affected members in the three families. There were one missense mutation 1214 (T-->C) in exon 9, two nonsense mutations 981 (T-->A) in exon 7 and 1234 (C-->T) in exon 9. All affected members of the three families were heterozygous for their respective mutation. CONCLUSION: Mutations in IRF6 gene were found in all VWS patients. This observation supports the hypothesis that IRF6 is the gene responsible for VWS across different populations.
