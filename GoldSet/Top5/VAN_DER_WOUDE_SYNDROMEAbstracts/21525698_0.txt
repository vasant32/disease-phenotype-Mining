Orofacial manifestations of Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) include cleft lip or palate, lower lip pits, hypodontia, hypernasal voice, cleft or bifid uvula, syngnathia, narrow high arched palate, and ankyloglossia. Extraoral manifestations include limb anomalies, popliteal webs, accessory nipples, congenital heart defects, and Hirschsprung disease. We report an interesting case of VWS with characteristic orofacial features along with an unusual additional finding of fusion of primary mandibular left lateral incisor and canine in a 7-year-old boy.
