Van der Woude syndrome is known to be the first syndromic cause of oral cleft. Apart clefts the cardinal signs are lower lip pits and hypodontia. IRF6Â gene mutations have been recently identified as potential cause in this syndrome which permits to better understand its phenotype heterogeneity. Based on a literature review, we tried to cover the different aspects of this syndrome with an emphasis on genetic counselling and surgical correction of lip pits.
