 PURPOSE: To describe the diagnosis and treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome as it relates to spontaneous abortion. METHODS: The relative importance of performing tests of antiphospholipid antibodies that prolong the partial thromboplastin time and other autoantibodies against phospholipids measured by ELISA are discussed. RESULTS: The most important diagnostic tests are the lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody and antiphosphatidyl serine. Low molecular weight heparin and low dose aspirin are the two most important therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Women with recurrent miscarriages or even an unexplained miscarriage especially after ten weeks (but sometimes even early first trimester) or a history of thrombosis or intrauterine growth restriction and maybe preeclampsia are candidates for anticoagulant therapy, especially with the presence of significant levels of the lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin or antiphosphatidyl serine antibodies (> 40 pl units/ml).
