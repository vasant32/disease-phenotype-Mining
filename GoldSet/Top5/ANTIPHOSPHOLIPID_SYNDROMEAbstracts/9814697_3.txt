Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by a prothrombotic state and the presence of beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI)-dependent antiphospholipid antibodies. The feasibility of a B cell tolerance-based approach for specific reduction of anti-beta2-GPI antibodies was investigated. Anti-beta2-GPI antibodies isolated from a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome were used to screen peptide libraries expressed in phage, resulting in the identification of a phage that specifically bound anti-beta2-GPI antibodies. The phage-displayed peptide was identified and chemically optimized to generate a synthetic 14-mer peptide with an internal thioether linkage (LJP 685) that retained the binding profile of the original phage. LJP 685 was conjugated to a defined, non-immunogenic organic platform to generate a tetravalent presentation of LJP 685 for use as a toleragen. Tetravalent LJP 685 induced a dose-dependent reduction in antibody levels in mice previously immunized and boosted with LJP 685 coupled to the carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin. These experiments support the technical feasibility of a tolerance-based approach for reducing anti-beta2-GPI antibodies in vivo.
