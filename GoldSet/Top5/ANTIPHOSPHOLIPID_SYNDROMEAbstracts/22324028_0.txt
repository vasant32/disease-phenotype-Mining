We report on two women who underwent myocardial revascularization associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with different pathogenic patterns. The first woman presented with acute myocardial infarction, and preoperative angiograms demonstrated rapidly progressing coronary lesions, presumptive unstable plaque, and dissection. Operative findings, however, showed fresh thrombi in the coronary arteries, and she was diagnosed postoperatively as having APS. Her one-year angiogram demonstrated improved coronary lesions and a competitive flow pattern in the grafts. The second woman presented with unstable angina and had been treated for systemic lupus erythematosus and secondary APS for more than 14 years. She underwent myocardial revascularization due to accelerated coronary atherosclerosis. Her one-year angiogram demonstrated patent grafts.
