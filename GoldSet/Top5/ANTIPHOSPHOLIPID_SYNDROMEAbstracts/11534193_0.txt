Uterine scrapes from 45 women (30 cases of spontaneous and 15 cases of artificial abortions) were studied. Heterogeneity of distribution of large granular lymphocytes and macrophages in decidual membrane of women with spontaneous abortions was revealed. Autoimmune disturbances were found primarily in the subgroup with domination of large granular lymphocytes, urogenital infection prevailed in the subgroup with macrophage domination. Hormonal disturbances and uterine malformations occurred more frequently in women with normal count of lymphocytes and macrophages.
