AIM: To characterize the course of lupus nephritis (LN) in terms of demographic indices (sex, age of renal disease onset), the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and to ascertain a prognostic role of the disease exacerbations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 121 LN patients were followed up from 1997 to 2004 (mean duration of the follow-up 5.6 +/- 6.4 years). A LN course was characterized by the presence of a complete or partial remission, exacerbation of the disease, repeated hospitalisations. Two types of exacerbations were considered: proteinuric, running with progressive proteinuria and normal renal function (type 1); functional, running with elevation of blood creatinine (type 2). RESULTS: Exacerbations were observed in one third of the examinees, 70% of them ran with renal dysfunction. Exacerbations occurred more frequently in males than in females (50 vs 27%, respectively; p = 0.08) and in patients with early onset of LN (at the age of 40 years and younger, 80 vs 60%, respectively; p < 0.05). Exacerbations of type 2 occurred in males, in patients with early onset of renal damage and in APS association. It is shown that LN exacerbations, their incidence and type (a functional type) have a negative influence on renal survival of the patients. CONCLUSION: Identification of groups of LN patients at high risk of exacerbations and unfavourable prognostic role of exacerbations dictates the necessity of due immunosuppressive therapy for maintenance of remission.
