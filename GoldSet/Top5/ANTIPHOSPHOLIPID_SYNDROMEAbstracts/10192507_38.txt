Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are associated with neurological diseases such as stroke, migraine, epilepsy and dementia and are thus associated with both vascular and non-vascular neurological disease. We have therefore examined the possibility that these antibodies interact directly with neuronal tissue by studying the electrophysiological effects of aPL on a brain synaptosoneurosome preparation. IgG from patients with high levels of aPL and neurological involvement was purified by protein-G affinity chromatography as was control IgG pooled from ten sera with low levels of aPL. Synaptoneurosomes were purified from perfused rat brain stem. IgG from the patient with the highest level of aPL at a concentration equivalent to 1:5 serum dilution caused significant depolarization of the synaptoneurosomes as determined by accumulation of the lipophylic cation [3H]-tetraphenylphosphonium. IgG from this patient as well as IgG from two elderly patients with high levels of aPL were subsequently shown to permeabilize the synaptosomes to labeled nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and pertussis toxin-ADP-ribose transferase (PTX-A protein) as assayed by labeled ADP-ribosylation of G-proteins in the membranes. No such effects were seen with the control IgG. aPL may thus have the potential to disrupt neuronal function by direct action on nerve terminals. These results may explain some of the non-thromboembolic CNS manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome.
