NZW x BXSB F1 mice develop a systemic autoimmune syndrome with various lupus-like manifestations. Male animals develop a degenerative coronary disease with myocardial infarction, resulting in death before 6 mo of age. The presence in these mice of anti-phospholipid Abs reacting with beta2-glycoprotein I may contribute to the pathogenesis of the cardiovascular lesions. beta2-glycoprotein I, a plasma protein implicated in various aspects of the coagulation pathway, is also the target of autoantibodies in humans with the anti-phospholipid syndrome. We obtained several mAbs from NZW x BXSB F1 mice that were selected for binding to cardiolipin. Two mAbs are specific for beta2-glycoprotein I and display a species-dependent pattern with preferential reactivity to mouse beta2-glycoprotein I. The other mAbs display charge-mediated interactions with anionic phospholipids in the absence of beta2-glycoprotein I. The analysis of the V region sequences of the mAbs suggests that cationic residues in the H chain complementarity-determining region 3 are important for their phospholipid reactivity. The structural features of the V(H)-D-J(H) junctions of these mAbs further support the view that an increased frequency of unusual V(D)J rearrangements directly contributes to the development of murine autoimmunity.
