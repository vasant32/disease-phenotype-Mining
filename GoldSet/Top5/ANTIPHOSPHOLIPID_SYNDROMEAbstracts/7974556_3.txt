BACKGROUND: We describe a young woman who presented with minor stroke as a first clinical symptom of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) in the absence of well-known risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. CASE DESCRIPTION: The medical history included recurrent miscarriages and sun rashes, which directed the diagnosis toward immunologic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which are often associated with stroke. Only complete laboratory testing, including SSB antibody studies, and ophthalmologic and salivary gland evaluation revealed the correct diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Sjögren's syndrome should be considered among the causes of stroke, especially in a young female patient.
