 BACKGROUND: There is limited knowledge about endothelial dysfunction in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate endothelial function in patients with PAPS assessed by positron emission tomography. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 3-phase protocol--rest, cold pressor test (CPT), and adenosine positron emission tomography with nitrogen 13 ammonia--was used in 18 patients with PAPS and 18 healthy volunteers (HVs). Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured in each phase, with calculation of the endothelial-dependent vasodilation index, the increase in the MBF in response to CPT, and the myocardial flow reserve. An important trend was found in the myocardial flow reserve (2.76 +/- 1.04 in PAPS group vs 3.27 +/- 0.72 in HV group, P > .05), in the endothelial-dependent vasodilation index (1.19 +/- 0.31 in PAPS group vs 1.55 +/- 0.37 in HV group, P < .05), and in the percent change in the MBF in response to CPT (from rest) (19% +/- 31% in PAPS group vs 55% +/- 37% in HV group, P < .05). CONCLUSION: The CPT results obtained in this study showed that the PAPS patients studied have endothelial dysfunction.
