 PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was to evaluate fetal biometry, Doppler values, and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome treated with acetylsalicylic acid and heparin. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-five pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome using 100 mg/day acetylsalicylic acid and 5,000 IU heparin every 12 h were evaluated in this prospective observational study. Ultrasonography was performed between 24 and 38 weeks of gestational age to assess estimated fetal weight, placental thickness, amniotic fluid index, fetal biophysical profile and Doppler evaluation of maternal uterine arteries, and fetal middle cerebral and umbilical arteries. Data regarding Apgar score, gender, delivery mode, and birth weight and length were recorded after birth. RESULTS: The observed values for ultrasonographic assessment and perinatal outcomes were not very different from the expected values for normal pregnancies. The birth weight was 2863.3 ± 737.7 g (mean ± SD) and length was 46.8 ± 4.2 cm. Only one newborn (4%) had the 1-min Apgar score <7 and all had the 5-min Apgar score >7. CONCLUSION: Gestational and perinatal evaluation of pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome using both acetylsalicylic acid and heparin was reassuring.
