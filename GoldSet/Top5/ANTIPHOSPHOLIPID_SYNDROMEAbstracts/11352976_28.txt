beta(2)-Glycoprotein I (beta(2)-GPI) is a major antigen for antiphospholipid antibodies (Abs) present in patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). We previously reported that beta(2)-GPI specifically binds to oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), but not to native low density lipoprotein (LDL). In the present study, a ligand specific for beta(2)-GPI, oxLig-1, was purified from the extracted lipids of oxLDL. The structure of oxLig-1 was shown to be identical to that of synthesized 7-ketocholesteryl-9-carboxynonanoate by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. Both purified and synthesized oxLig-1 were recognized by beta(2)-GPI and subsequently by anti-beta(2)-GPI auto-Abs, either in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or in ligand blot analysis. Binding of liposomes containing oxLig-1 (oxLig-1-liposomes) to mouse macrophages, J774A.1 cells, was relatively low, as compared with that of phosphatidylserine (PS)-liposomes. In contrast, binding of oxLig-1-liposomes was enhanced more than 10-fold in the presence of both beta(2)-GPI and an anti-beta(2)-GPI auto-Ab (WB-CAL-1), derived from (NZW x BXSB) F1 mouse, an animal APS model. Anti-beta(2)-GPI auto-Abs derived from APS patients with episodes of arterial thrombosis were detected in ELISA, using a solid phase oxLig-1 complexed with beta(2)-GPI. We suggest that autoimmune atherogenesis linked to beta(2)-GPI interaction with oxLDL and Abs may be present in APS.
