Combined central retinal artery occlusion and central retinal venous occlusion have been rarely reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and anti-phospholipid syndrome. The impact of this severe vaso-occlusive disease on vision is usually devastating and permanent in spite of vigorous treatment. We report herein a 35-year-old female patient displaying a transient and reversible process. Her best-corrected visual acuity improved from 6/60 to 6/8.6 1 day later, before the initiation of systemic corticosteroid and anticoagulant treatment. The retina regained a normal appearance with her vision recovering to 6/6 2 weeks after the episode of temporary vision loss. Her rapid recovery suggests that continued anti-coagulation therapy and close follow-up to prevent severe complications and recurrent thrombosis is warranted.
