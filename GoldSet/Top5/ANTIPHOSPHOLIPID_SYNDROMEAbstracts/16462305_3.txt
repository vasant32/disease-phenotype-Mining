High prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies and antiphospholipid antibodies has been reported in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. A full blown clinical picture of antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) is rare and rarely reported, even in HIV-infected adults and has never been reported in HIV-infected children. We report an HIV-infected child with left sided choreoathetosis associated with APLS.
