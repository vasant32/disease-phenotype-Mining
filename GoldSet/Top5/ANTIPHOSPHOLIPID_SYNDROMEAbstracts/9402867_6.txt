We describe a case of classical polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) with visceral aneurysms presenting with renal infarction and hypertension. The female patient also had all the laboratory features of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and 2 months into her illness developed a large iliofemoral thrombosis. She responded well to immunosuppressive therapy and anti-coagulation. Repeat arteriogram showed regression of the visceral aneurysms. The link between PAN and APS, and the therapeutic dilemma posed by this association, are discussed.
