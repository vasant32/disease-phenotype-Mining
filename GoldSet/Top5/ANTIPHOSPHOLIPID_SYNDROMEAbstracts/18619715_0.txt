Pulmonary embolism is the main pulmonary manifestation of primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Other pulmonary manifestations including intra-alveolar haemorrhage are less common. We report a 36-year-old man with a primary antiphospholipid syndrome who presented with an acute respiratory failure due to the association of pulmonary embolism and intra-alveolar haemorrhage. This diagnosis should be systematically considered as it is life threatening and requires a specific therapy.
