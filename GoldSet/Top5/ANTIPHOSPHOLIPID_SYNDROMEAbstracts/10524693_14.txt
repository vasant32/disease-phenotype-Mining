OBJECTIVE: To investigate the putative involvement of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) alleles in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). METHODS: This study of French Caucasians included 171 unrelated patients with SLE, 88 unrelated patients with primary APS, and 193 ethnically matched healthy controls. The SLE group comprised 89 patients with sporadic SLE and 82 patients with familial SLE. Patients' and controls' DNA were genotyped for the various alleles of a polymorphic CA dinucleotide repeat located within the promoter region of PARP. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed for the distribution of PARP alleles between the healthy control group and each patient group or the pooled SLE patient group. CONCLUSION: The study findings strongly suggest that these alleles do not influence susceptibility to SLE or primary APS in French Caucasians.
