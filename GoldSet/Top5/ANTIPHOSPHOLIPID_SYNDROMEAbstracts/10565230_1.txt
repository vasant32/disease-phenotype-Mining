It is well known that the administration of high-dose gamma-globulin concentrate is effective in alleviating thrombocytopenia in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). However, treatment can sometimes induce aseptic meningitis. A 25-year-old Japanese woman with antiphospholipid syndrome and ITP was conditioned with high-dose gamma-globulin concentrate prior to splenectomy. Three days after the initial gamma-globulin course, she experienced severe headache, vomiting, and high-grade fever. Cerebrospinal fluid examination yielded a diagnosis of aseptic meningitis. The patient's clinical symptoms and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid findings disappeared immediately after the discontinuation of gamma-globulin therapy. Cases of aseptic meningitis induced by high-dose gamma-globulin therapy are uncommon in the literature, and most involve children. Moreover, to our knowledge, only 1 Japanese adult ITP case of gamma-globulin-induced aseptic meningitis has been reported to date. Aseptic meningitis may be one of the important adverse effects of the administration of high-dose gamma-globulin concentrate to pediatric as well as adult ITP patients.
