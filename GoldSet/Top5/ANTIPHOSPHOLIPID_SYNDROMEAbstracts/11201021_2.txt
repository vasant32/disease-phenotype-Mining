Increased thrombin generation associated with resistance to activated protein C makes the latter a likely candidate for an increased risk of acute coronary events. Activated protein C resistance (factor V Leiden) on its own, however, appears to have no significant effect in this regard. We describe a case of recurrent myocardial infarction caused by coronary thrombosis in a patient with persistent thrombocytopenia who was found to have a coexistence of heterozygous factor V Leiden and primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Since both thrombophilic disorders interfere with the protein C anticoagulant system, the simultaneous existence of inherited and acquired resistance against activated protein C could account for an increased thrombophilia with manifestation in the coronary arteries. This case suggests that evaluation of patients who present with recurrent acute coronary events should also consider these coagulation defects.
