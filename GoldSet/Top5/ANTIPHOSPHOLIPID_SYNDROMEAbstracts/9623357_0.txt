The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) in human reproduction. The investigation included 150 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and a group of 931 women, with the history of recurrent spontaneously miscarried pregnancies of unknown origin, even after a detailed examination in obstetric-gynecological institution. APA were investigated by means of tests to lupus anticoagulant (LA), applying a set of coagulation tests, including two tests with viper's poison, and cardiolipin antibodies (ACL) were determined by a standard immunoenzyme method, where a cardiolipin (Sigma, USA) was used as an antigen. The analysis of obstetric history in women with SLE has shown a considerable increase in frequency of obstetric complications in APA-positive group of patients (p < 0.001). Screening-examination to APA, proved its presence in 254 of the total of 931 women (27%), and a complete evaluation of the positive group enabled the establishing of SLE diagnosis in 13 patients, in accordance with the valid criteria of the disease.
