We report the case of a 41-year-old woman, affected by Vaquez syndrome, admitted to our hospital for a severe pain in the right hypochondrium, suddenly followed by hepatomegaly and ascites. The clinical and laboratory data were suggestive of hepatic insufficiency and abdominal ultrasonography, integrated by color Doppler and computed tomography, revealed an interrupted hepatic venous outflow. In addition a spontaneous prolonged partial thromboplastin time was present and the patient was found to be positive for lupus anticoagulant. A transient clinical improvement, with a partial reperfusion of suprahepatic veins, was achieved with medical treatment by using anticoagulants, diuretics and paracentesis. However, the patient showed a subsequence of suprahepatic venous thrombosis, although two transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts with stent placement and local thrombolysis were performed. The polycythemia vera is a disease mainly associated with Budd-Chiari syndrome but, in our patient, the thrombotic event occurred in spite of normal values of hematocrit and platelet count. Certainly in this case the lupus anticoagulant positivity represents an additional thrombogenic factor. Nowadays the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is a recognized and not unusual cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome but, to our knowledge, this is the first case characterized by the presence of polycythemia vera and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome to be reported.
