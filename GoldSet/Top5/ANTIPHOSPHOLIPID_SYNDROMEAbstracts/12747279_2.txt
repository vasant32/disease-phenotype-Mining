OBJECTIVE: Some studies have previously suggested the involvement of antibodies directed against CD36 (anti-CD36) in the pathogenesis of thrombosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of anti-CD36 in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and its relationship with thrombosis. METHODS: Anti-CD36 were tested using an indirect MAIPA assay in 62 patients with autoimmune aPL but without SLE; there were 38 with and 24 without thrombosis. Nineteen patients with thrombosis served as an aPL(-) control group and 58 healthy subjects as the normal control group. RESULTS: 15 of 62 aPL patients (24.2%) but only 1 of 58 (1.7%) normal controls had anti-CD36 (p < 0.0005). As compared to normal controls, the prevalence of anti-CD36 was significantly higher in aPL patients with (26.3%, p < 0.0005) or without thrombosis (20.8%, p < 0.01). Anti-CD36 were significantly more frequent in aPL patients with thrombosis than in thrombosis aPL(-) subjects (26.3% vs 0%, p = 0.02). The presence of anti-CD36 seems to be more frequent in aPL patients with recurrent thrombosis than in those with a single episode (36.8% vs 15.8%). CONCLUSION: The presence of anti-CD36 is highly prevalent in patients with autoimmune aPL with a trend to being more frequent in patients with recurrent episodes of thrombosis.
