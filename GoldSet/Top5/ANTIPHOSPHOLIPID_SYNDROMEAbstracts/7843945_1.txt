The case of a young male patient presenting isolated clustered partial seizures is reported. Despite the normality of the neurological features, as well as of ictal and interictal EEG, the MRI (performed three days after the symptoms) disclosed bilateral signal alterations in the parietal cortical region. These abnormalities disappeared at the MRI control examination performed one month later. The finding of positive anticardiolipine antibodies made possible the diagnosis of partial epileptic seizures symptomatic of a vascular disorder ascribed to a Primary antiphospholipid Syndrome (PAPS).
