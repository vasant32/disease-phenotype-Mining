 BACKGROUND: Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) have increased risks of developing thromboembolism, and the risk maybe amplified by the hypercoagulable state associated with pregnancy. CASE: A patient presented with severe chest pain, mild pyrexia associated with elevated serum transaminases, and marked neutrophilia after vaginal delivery. Liver infarction was diagnosed by spiral computer tomography and treated successfully with anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: Liver infarction is a possible diagnosis in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome who presents with chest or abdominal pain in the postpartum period.
