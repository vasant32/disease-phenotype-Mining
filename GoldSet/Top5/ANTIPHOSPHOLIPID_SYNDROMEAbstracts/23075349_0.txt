This study comprised 74 infertile patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), among which 26 women became pregnant. Pregnancies were followed according to the standard antenatal follow-up protocol of high-risk pregnancies. The principal outcome measures were the termination of pregnancy and its upshot. This study comprised 74 infertile patients with FMF. Of the cases, 12 (16.22%) had antiphospholipid syndrome (APS); 16 patients (21.62%) had a history of previous abdominal/pelvic surgery, which might have been contributing to delay of conception; 66 patients (89.18%) were on drug therapy by corticosteroids, colchicines and other agents. A total of 10/22 patients were delivered by caesarean section for complicated pregnancies. Six of the newborns were positive for the MEFV gene. Favourable pregnancy outcome occurs in patients with FMF treated with colchicine before and after pregnancy. Neonatal outcome was similar to that expected in the general population.
