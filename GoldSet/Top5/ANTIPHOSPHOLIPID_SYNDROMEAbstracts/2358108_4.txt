A 30-year-old woman with recurrent necrotizing purpura on the legs which did not fit, to our knowledge, within any distinctive pathological entity, is described. Laboratory investigations disclosed a mild thrombocytopenia and antiphospholipid antibodies, i.e. lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin. Cutaneous lesions may be an early marker of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
