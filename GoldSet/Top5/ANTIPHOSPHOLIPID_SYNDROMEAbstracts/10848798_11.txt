[14C]-Serotonin release assay (14C-SRA) from platelets is considered to be the most sensitive test for laboratory confirmation of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). This study compared 14C-SRA with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to determine the release of serotonin from platelets in the presence of heparin and serum from HIT patients. The normal range (median, 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles) of serotonin release from platelets in healthy subjects (n = 149) is 38 ng/ml (19 and 62) measured by EIA-SRA. Serum from HIT patients (n = 42) released 2548 ng/ml (244 and 7987) serotonin in the presence of 0.1 IU/ml heparin and 29 ng/ml (13 and 76) in the presence of 100 IU/ml heparin. One hundred per cent and 15% of HIT samples exhibited an elevated serotonin release from platelets in the presence of 0.1 IU/ml low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, 2100 ng/ml (869 and 5968), or danaparoid, 272 ng/ml (143 and 403), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the EIA-SRA was 100% and 97.4% and of the 14C-SRA 100% and 92.9% in HIT patients. No false-positive results were found in patients receiving heparin (n = 28), in patients with elevated levels of bilirubin (n = 5), in patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (n = 10) or in non-HIT patients (n = 78) with both assays. The EIA technique to quantify serotonin release from platelets provides a reliable non-radioactive method to diagnose heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and to assess in vitro crossreactivity of low molecular weight heparins and heparinoid.
