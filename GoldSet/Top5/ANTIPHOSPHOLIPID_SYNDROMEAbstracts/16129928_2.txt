BACKGROUND: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a major reproductive complication in women, which is characterized by recurrent fetal loss, thrombosis, and thrombocytopenia in association with anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL). AIMS: To analyze the prevalence of aCL and antiphosphatidylserine antibodies (aPS) in relation to pregnancy failures in women with the history of recurrent spontaneous abortion. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A sequential study of 155 patients, who had three or more recurrent spontaneous abortions, was carried out. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss in first trimester were selected for this study. Anticardiolipin antibodies IgG and aPS IgG were detected in the serum by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay method. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Percentage calculation was carried out. Two-tailed t-test was performed to know the significance of aCL and aPS total population. RESULT: The levels of aCL IgG and aPS IgG were detected as 40% (62) and 19% (18), respectively in women with history of recurrent abortion. CONCLUSION: Anticardiolipin antibody is found to be the most important factor for recurrent abortion. In addition, women with negative aCL are having positive for another antiphospholipid antibodies like aPS, which may involve in recurrent abortion.
