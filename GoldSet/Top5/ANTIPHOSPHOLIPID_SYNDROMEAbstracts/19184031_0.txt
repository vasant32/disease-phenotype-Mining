We report a rare case of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis. A 59-year-old woman with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was admitted because of coma. The blood test showed a typically cirrhosis pattern including an elevated serum ammonia level. Abdominal computed tomography showed liver cirrhosis and thrombus in the right branch of the portal vein. To elucidate the cause of PVT, antiphospholipid antibodies were examined. Both IgG anti-cardiolipin antibody (ELISA) and IgG anti-cardiolipin-beta2 -glycoprotein I complex antibody (ELISA) were positive. When PVT is detected in a patient with cirrhosis, it might be necessary to examine antiphospholipid antibodies to clarify the cause of PVT.
