Peptide-mediated immunotherapy has been studied in a number of experimental models of autoimmune diseases and has also been tested in human patients to a certain extent. Copolymer 1 is a synthetic amino acid copolymer that has been demonstrated to suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (a model for multiple sclerosis) when administered parenterally. Some study results indicate that mucosal tolerance induced by appropriate recombinant peptide fragments of human AChR is effective in suppressing experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis and might be considered as a therapeutic modality for patients with MG. A peptide of the heat-shock protein 60 molecule, designated peptide p277, was shown to be a target of T cells in autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice, and intraperitoneal injections of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) peptide 524-543 delayed the onset of diabetes and significantly reduced its incidence. Experimental evidence has revealed that CDR-based peptides may be potential candidates for the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus. The use of synthetic peptides that focus on neutralization of pathogenic anti-beta 2GPI antibodies represents a possible new therapeutic approach to antiphospholipid syndrome. Studies in both acute and chronic-relapsing experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis have indicated that oral administration of S-Ag, S-Ag-derived peptides, inter-photoreceptor retinoid binding protein or HLA-derived peptides before immunization can protect animals from the disease.
