 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study is to describe our experience with patients who have a transmural myocardial infarction (MI) in the presence of a normal coronary artery. The clinical profile, demographic characteristics and outcomes of these patients are discussed. METHODS: Between January 2006 and August 2011, 21 patients who presented with a Q-wave myocardial infarction were found to have normal coronary arteries. The prevalence rate of this entity was 1.5% (21 out of 1,400 Q wave MI patients). These patients were characterized by their young age (the mean age=44.95±14.86), male dominance (90.47%), and a high prevalence of smoking (85.71%). In this study, 4 patients have an evident spontaneous spasm shown on coronary angiography which disappeared after intracoronary injection of nitrates. Coagulation Disorders, such as activated protein C resistance (APC) resistance, protein C deficiency and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome were found in 4 of 12 patients who underwent systematic examination. One patient had a history of lung cancer which may be associated with a hypercoagulable state and may explain the occurrence of myocardial infarction with a normal coronary artery. The mean left ventricle ejection was 56. 5±12. The mean follow-up was 24±10 months. Six patients developed residual chest pain which was generally easily controlled by anti-spastic therapy and no patient had a major cardiovascular event. CONCLUSION: Patients with Q-wave MI and with normal coronary arteries seem to have a good short and long-term prognosis especially when they are treated with an exclusive medical strategy.
