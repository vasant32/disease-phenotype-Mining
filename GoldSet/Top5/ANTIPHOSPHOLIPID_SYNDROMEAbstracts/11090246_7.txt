Exposure to phosphatidylserine (PS) tags dying and senescent cells for removal and identifies activated platelets. In this study we followed the fate of PS-exposing platelets in the presence of antibodies purified from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and primary Anti-phospholipid Syndrome (APS) patients' sera by beta2GPI affinity chromatography. Thrombin-activated platelets exposed PS and associated to beta2GPI. Both events were required for recognition by antibodies. Human monocyte-derived macrophages phagocytosed activated platelets only. Each macrophage internalized an average of 3.16+/-0.2 platelets after 60 min at 37 degrees C. Phagocytosis did not increase after longer incubations (4.65+/-0.26 platelets internalized by each macrophage after 300 min). Recognition of platelets by anti-beta2GPI antibodies significantly increased phagocytosis (P< 0.01). Upon withdrawal of thrombin, platelets downregulated PS (PS exposure t(1/2): 242 min) and the ability to be recognized by macrophages. Purified beta2GPI bound to PS-exposing platelets (association t(1/2): 250 min). Phosphatidyl serine exposure and beta2GPI association had virtually identical kinetics. Antibody binding prolonged the exposure of the beta2GPI/PS complex (t(1/2): >1200 min). The ability to phagocytose opsonized platelets was accordingly sustained (5.3+/-0.2 opsonized platelets were internalized by each macrophage after 60 min and 9.4+/-0.3 after 300 min). Anti-beta2GPI antibodies therefore poise activated platelets in a PS-exposing status, preventing the recycling of their function and favoring their phagocytic clearance.
