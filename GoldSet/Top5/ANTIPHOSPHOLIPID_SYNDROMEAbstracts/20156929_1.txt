The involvement of the peripheral nervous system in diverse autoimmune diseases is well established. However, no appropriately designed studies have been performed in primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS)-related peripheral neuropathy. We aimed to investigate the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy in patients diagnosed with PAPS. Twenty-six consecutive patients with PAPS (Sapporo criteria) and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled at two referral centers. Exclusion criteria were secondary causes of peripheral neuropathy. A complete clinical neurologic exam followed by nerve conduction studies (NCS) was performed. Paresthesias were reported in eight patients (31%). Objective mild distal weakness and abnormal symmetric deep tendon reflexes were observed in three patients (11.5%). With regard to the electrophysiologic evidence of peripheral neuropathy, nine patients (35.0%) had alterations: four (15.5%) had pure sensory or sensorimotor distal axonal neuropathy (in two of them a carpal tunnel syndrome was also present) and one (4%) had sensorimotor demyelinating and axonal neuropathy involving upper and lower extremities, while four patients (15.5%) showed isolated carpal tunnel syndrome. Clinical and serologic results were similar in all the patients with PAPS, regardless of the presence of electrophysiologic alterations. In conclusion, peripheral neuropathy is a common asymptomatic abnormality in patients with PAPS. The routine performance of NCS may be considered when evaluating such patients.
