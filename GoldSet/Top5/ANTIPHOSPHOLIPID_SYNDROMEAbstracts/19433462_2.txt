The objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies, mainly anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I (anti-beta(2)-GPI), and their possible clinical and laboratory relevance in mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). This study included 39 consecutive patients with MCTD (Kasukawa's criteria) from January, 2005, to March, 2007, and compared them with 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. IgG and IgM anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta(2)-GPI were measured by ELISA. Lupus anticoagulant (LA) was detected by functional coagulation tests. Medium to high titres of aCL and anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies were found in sera from four (10.2%) MCTD patients. One of these patients was found to be positive for IgM aCL, IgM anti-beta(2)-GPI and LA antibodies simultaneously. Additionally, this patient had a previous history of foetal loss in the second trimester and new-onset pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The other three patients had none of the manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) or PAH. The mean value of IgG anti-beta(2)-GPI was higher among those MCTD patients with PAH than in the group without PAH (34.2 +/- 46.8 vs 12.3 +/- 9.1, P = 0.018). None of the controls were positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. High to moderate titres of anti-beta(2)-GPI as well as APS were rare in MCTD, and these antibodies may be correlated with the development of PAH in these patients.
