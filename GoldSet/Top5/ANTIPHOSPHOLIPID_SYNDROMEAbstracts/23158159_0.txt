Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) refers to a group of clinical symptoms and signs caused by antiphospholipid antibody (aPLA). We reported a rare case of poor outcome of a pregnant woman with APS. The pregnant woman had APS, hemolytic anemia, elevated liver function and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, and eclampsia and had a poor outcome from a second pregnancy. She was treated with antispasmodics, sedatives, and anti-hypertensive agents, along with anticoagulant therapy and infusion of immunoglobulin. APS during pregnancy often makes pregnancy even more complex and risky. Obstetricians should carry out anticoagulation treatment throughout the perinatal period.
