 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to describe chorea during systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid antibodies and its long-term outcome. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical features, laboratory findings, imaging characteristics, and outcome in a series of 32 patients. RESULTS: Most patients were women (28 of 32), and mean age at onset of chorea was 20.6 (9-62) years. Chorea was inaugural for 28 patients. Improvement was observed with various treatments. During follow-up (12.2 Â± 11.3 years), severe manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus were rare. Antiphospholipid antibodies were repeatedly positive for 90% of the patients. Twelve patients developed arterial thrombosis. Prophylactic treatment with antithrombotic therapy might reduce the risk of further thrombosis (8% versus 57%; P = 0.01). Cardiac valvulopathy occurred in 22 patients during follow-up. Chorea relapsed in 8 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Chorea had a good outcome in itself. This long-term follow-up shows, for the first time, that these patients have substantial risk for further arterial thrombosis.
