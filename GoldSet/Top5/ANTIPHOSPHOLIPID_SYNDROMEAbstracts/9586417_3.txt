Vascular damage is a well known cause of hypopituitarism since Sheehan's report of postpartum pituitary necrosis; it has subsequently been reported that also sickle-cell anemia, eclampsia, pituitary apoplexy and other pathologies may induce failure of the anterior hypophysis through this mechanism. The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by widespread arterial and venous thrombosis with resulting different clinical features; Addison's disease due to adrenal thrombosis is the only endocrine involvement reported so far in this syndrome. We report here a case of global anterior pituitary insufficiency which developed soon after cerebral ischaemic stroke in a 62 year aged woman with Lupus aicoagulant activity (LAC) and large atrial thrombosis; underlying pathologies were excluded by appropriate investigations. Therefore in our opinion this is the first case in which anterior hypopituitarism is reported in the clinical constellation of APS and the second type of endocline involvement.
