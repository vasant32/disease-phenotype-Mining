 AIM: The aspect of the retinal vessels may suggest the presence of the antiphospholipid antibodies that can be detected afterwards in the patient's blood by lab tests. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aCL) seems to be the sign for brain ischemic lesions by clotting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three cases of aspects of retinal vessels associated with aCL (antiphospholipid antibodies) present in patients with: slowly progressive memory problems, "atypical multiple sclerosis", amaurosis fugax in contraceptive treatment. RESULTS: The presence of the aCL antibodies and the aspect of the retinal vessels signaled the possibility of an abnormal clotting leading to stroke. Discontinuities in the vessels pathways both in the retinopathy and AFG, suggesting an abnormal blood flow in the retinal vessels, while the aCL present signals a clotting with multiple brain ischemic lesions. CONCLUSION: This aspect of the retinal arterial or/and venous vessels requires laboratory blood dosing for antiphospholipid antibodies. Their presence will be a definite sign for a future thrombosis and multiple brain ischemic lesions. The treatment with sulodexide, initially injectable, then oral formula was used for 6 - 14 months, until the disappearance of the antiphospholipid antibodies, but, more than that until the aspect of the retinal vessels went back to normal
