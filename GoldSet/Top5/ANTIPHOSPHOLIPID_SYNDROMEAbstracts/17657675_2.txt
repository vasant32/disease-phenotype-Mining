BACKGROUND: We describe a family with a 7-year-old proband case diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) plus secondary anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) as well as two affected paternal aunts. We compared the frequency of these polymorphisms with healthy controls. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the mode of inheritance in this familial case of APS and SLE and the possible association of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) -675 4G/5G and PAI-2 Ser(413)/Cys polymorphisms. To compare the genotype frequency of these polymorphisms with the results found in a Mexican Mestizo population. METHODS: PAI-1 -675 4G/5G and PAI-2 Ser(413)/Cys were determined by the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique using Bsl I and Mwo I on four generations of the family studied. PAI-2 Ser(413)/Cys polymorphism was also determined in 50 healthy individuals of Mexican Mestizo origin. RESULTS: The family pedigree demonstrated that this family did not follow a Mendelian inheritance pattern. When the PAI-2 Ser(413)/Cys polymorphism was examined, we found that 60% (3/5) of the relatives homozygous to Ser(413)/Ser were affected with SLE and/or APS (p = 0.027). The proband case was 4G/5G genotype for the PAI-1 -675 4G/5G polymorphism. No differences between healthy controls of the Mexican Mestizo population and the family studied for the PAI-2 Ser(413)/Cys polymorphism or PAI-1 -675 4G/5G polymorphisms were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that this family did not follow the Mendelian inheritance pattern. The Ser(413)/Ser genotype demonstrated in 60% of the affected members (3/5) of this family might increase the risk for autoimmune syndromes such as APS or SLE.
