 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) fractions from subjects with antiphospholipid syndrome (aPS) have previously been demonstrated to have inhibitory activity against tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). This may contribute to the development of a prothrombotic state by impaired regulation of the tissue factor (TF) pathway. This study investigated the effect that IgG fractions from aPS subjects containing anti-TFPI activity have on in vitro TF-induced thrombin generation. DESIGN AND METHODS: TFPI and anti-TFPI activities were determined in normal controls (n=29) and aPS subjects (n=57). TFPI activity was determined using an amidolytic assay based on the generation of factor Xa. Anti-TFPI activity was determined after incubating IgG isolated from a control or subject plasma with pooled normal plasma, using the TFPI activity assay. The influence of IgG fractions from controls (n=10) and subjects (n=23) on TF-induced in vitro thrombin generation was determined using a chromogenic assay of thrombin activity. RESULTS: TFPI activity in controls (1.13+/-0.25 U/mL) was significantly lower than in subjects (1.30+/-0.42 U/mL) (p < 0.05). Anti-TFPI activity was significantly higher in subjects than controls (p = 0.0001). TF-induced thrombin generation was positively associated with anti-TFPI activity (r = 0.356; p > 0.05), with increased levels of each demonstrated in 5 subjects. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TFPI activity was confirmed in 65% of aPS subjects. IgG fractions demonstrated a variable ability to interfere with TFPI function and TF-induced thrombin generation. Cross-reacting antiphospholipid antibodies and/or other entities may interfere with TFPI function, resulting in a net increase in thrombin generation and an increased thrombotic risk.
