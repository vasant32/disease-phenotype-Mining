Stroke in young adults has been related to mechanisms different to those found in older individuals. Cardiogenic embolism, arteritis, atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, pregnancy-related angiopathy, migrainous stroke, anaemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, arterial dissection, the consumption of toxic substances and head trauma have been described. We present a young man with a case history of tobacco and cocaine abuse who suffered a mild head trauma, with normal neurological examination, and a computed tomography scan image of a right anterior cerebral infarction. Serum biochemistry showed no alterations according to the diagnosis protocol for stroke in young patients. Various mechanisms have been involved, such as vasospasm, increasing arterial pressure and embolism. Considering the cocaine abuse and the mild head trauma, in our patient vasospasm was thought to be the mechanism involved in the cerebral infarction, which proved a challenge to diagnose in the emergency room.
