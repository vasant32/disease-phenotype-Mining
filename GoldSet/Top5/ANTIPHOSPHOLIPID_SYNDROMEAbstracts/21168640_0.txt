Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) in patients progressing to cirrhosis is an indication for liver transplantation. At this stage of disease, it is common to find large benign hepatocellular nodules (LBHNs) of undetermined cause that may be confused with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with indications for liver transplantation are currently classified according to the MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) severity score. When they fit Barcelona and Milan eligibility criteria for HCC, they receive 20 points. Thus, misdiagnosis of HCC leads to a privileged position on the waiting list. Herein, we have reported three BCS cases of cirrhotic patients who underwent liver transplantation; the pathologic results of their explanted livers showed LBHN. We analyzed three of 489 OLT who had chronic venous outflow obstruction (CVOO) the first case: was a 19-year-old man, with BCS of undetermined cause. The second 20-year-old female patients displayed BCS due to antiphospholipid syndrome the third, 45-year-old man had CVOO diagnosed preliminarily due to cryptogenic cirrhosis in the explanted liver. In the three cases, the nodules in the explant measured 0.5 to 2.4 cm. In the first case, the diagnosis was not in doubt; in the second case, 23 nodules were confused with HCC histologic evaluation, and in the third case three larger hypervascular nodules were misdiagnosed as HCC in the preoperative period despite low alpha-fetoprotein levels. In conclusion it is fundamental to recognize these benign lesions so as to avoid misdiagnosis, thereby allowing the proper selection of candidates for liver transplantation.
