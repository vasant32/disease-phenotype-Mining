Anetoderma is a rare cutaneous disease characterized by a loss of normal elastic tissue that is presented clinically as localized areas of wrinkled or flaccid skin. This form may be associated with several immunological abnormalities, most notably lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibodies with or without clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome. A retrospective study was conducted with the aim of summarizing the clinical characteristics, course and laboratory findings in three women with anetoderma-associated lupus erythematosus panniculitis, an unusual variant of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The 3 patients (of the 12 patients with lupus erythematosus panniculitis seen by us since 1990) were all at a young age at onset of panniculitis (median, 22 years). None of the patients developed severe systemic involvement up to 9 years (median, 5 years) from onset of the disease. The most noteworthy laboratory finding was the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Anetodermic lupus erythematosus panniculitis may be regarded as an uncommon variant of cutaneous lupus erythematosus mainly affecting young females and showing a favourable clinical course, although the patients should be followed and screened for the emergence of antiphospholipid syndrome. Antiphospholipid antibodies could play a role in the elastolytic process, leading to anetoderma.
