Rheumatic disease can affect and severely damage vital organs and thus cause acute emergencies and life-threatening complications. As systemic diseases they can cause any presenting complaint commonly encountered in emergency medicine. Because of their relative rarity in general practice, a high level of vigilance is required in order to recognize an emergency caused by an underlying rheumatic disease in individual cases. The most important rheumatological emergencies comprise septic arthritis, gout, atlantoaxial subluxation, renal crisis and digital ulcers in systemic sclerosis, amaurosis fugax in giant cell arteritis, the catastrophic anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome and the pulmonary-renal syndrome. This article provides an overview over these rheumatological emergencies in order to aid recognition of these entities in individual cases and to thus facilitate immediate and adequate treatment, which is of vital importance for affected patients.
