The relationship between thrombotic or thrombocytopenic complications and the existence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and/or lupus anticoagulant (LA) was studied in 146 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The prevalence of arterial thrombosis was obviously higher in patients who had both aCL and LA than in patients with either aCL or LA alone or in those with neither. Since a substantial fraction of the former group of patients with arterial thrombosis also had thrombocytopenia, there is a possibility that aCL and LA might enhance platelet activation and aggregation. To test this hypothesis, we studied the in vitro effects of aCL and LA on the enhancement of platelet activation by flow cytometric analysis using anti-CD62P and anti-CD41 monoclonal antibodies directed against platelet activation-dependent granule-external membrane (PADGEM) protein and platelet glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb). The IgG fraction purified from aCL+.LA+ plasma apparently enhanced platelet activation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at a low concentration, but IgG fractions from aCL+.LA- or aCL-.LA+ plasma did not cause enhancement of platelet activation. These results suggest that aCL and LA may cooperate to promote platelet activation, and may be involved, at least partially, in the pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis in patients with SLE.
