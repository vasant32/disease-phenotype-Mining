The case of a 34 year old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus with a history of three previous recurrent abortions and lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies is reported. Immunoadsorbent plasmapheresis with a dextran sulphate column was used to remove lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and antibodies to DNA during her fourth pregnancy in combination with low doses of aspirin and prednisolone. Although during the course of treatment prednisolone was transiently increased to 30 mg/day owing to an asymptomatic increase of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, the levels of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and antibodies to DNA were decreased by immunoadsorbent plasmapheresis and a baby girl was delivered successfully by caesarean section. Therefore, immunoadsorbent plasmapheresis with dextran sulphate seems to reduce the risk of recurrent abortion in patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome.
