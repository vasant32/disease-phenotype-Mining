 OBJECTIVES: to detect the prevalence of hyperhcy in SLE patients with and without antiphospholipid syndrom; to compare the Hcy levels between those patients and healthy controls and to determine the correlation between hyperhcy and antiphospholipid antibodies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: we studied 44 SLE patients: 17 had antiphospholipid syndrom and 27 didn't have it, and we compared them to 24 healthy controls. All of them where checked clinically and with laboratory tests like anticardiolypin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant and Hcy. Hcy > 9 was considered abnormal. Patient who had hyperhcy were treated with folic acid+vitB6+vitB12 a month along. Statistical analysis: cualytative variables: chi square or Fischer's; cuantitative variables: Student's T test or Mann-Whitney's test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: there were 35 trombotic manifestations in 44 patients. Hyperhcy was present in 27 SLE patients (61,4%), 12 of them had antiphospholipid syndrom. Hcy concentrations patients vs.controls was statisticaly different (p=0,002). There was also stastisticaly different the hcy concentration from SLE patients with SAF vs controls (p=0,003) and without SAF vs controls (p= 0,015). From 33 SLE patients, 20 (33%) were aCL(+). 15(75%) of them had hiperhcy.
