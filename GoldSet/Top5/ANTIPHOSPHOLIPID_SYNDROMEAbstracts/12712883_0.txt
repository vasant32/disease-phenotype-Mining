Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)--ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease--are associated with increased risk for thrombotic complications both in the arterial and venous system. Cerebral sinus thrombosis is a rare but potentially fatal consequence of these diseases. Modern imaging methods made this uncommon complication of IBD more frequently recognized. The link between IBDs and thrombosis has been extensively studied. Inherited coagulation disorders (APC resistance, antithrombin III and protein-S deficiency), acquired diseases (antiphospholipid syndrome), and the frequent use of corticosteroids were suspected. Two cases of ulcerative colitis associated with cerebral sinus thrombosis successfully treated are reported. The connection between IBD and thrombotic complications and the therapeutic risks are discussed as well.
