We describe the case of a 45-year-old woman who had drawn our attention for some recent episodes of transient  global amnesia that, upon further examination, resulted from ischemic  events caused by multiple arterial thrombosis (bilateral internal carotid occlusion, significant stenosis of the right external carotid, mild stenosis of the right vertebral artery, right anterior cerebral artery occlusion and severe stenosis of the anterior descending coronary artery) due to primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Revascularisation of either carotid was not attempted. A percutaneous intervention in the anterior descending coronary artery stenosis was performed successfully. Due to severe arterial thrombosis, the patient was discharged with only duplex antiplatelet treatment and subcutaneous anticoagulant therapy, since immunotherapy is not indicated in primary APS. The occurrence of transient global amnesia should raise the suspicion of APS.
