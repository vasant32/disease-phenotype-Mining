 BACKGROUND: We have observed that some cases of food anaphylaxis were followed by severe thrombosis associated to anticardiolipin antibodies. Food anaphylaxis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome has seldom been published. OBJECTIVE: The aims were: 1) to test anticardiolipin antibodies in an important number of patients with anaphylaxis due to vegetal foods and their relationship with possible thrombosis; and 2) to study seed and fruit hypersensitivity in patients with previous thrombotic events associated with antiphospholipid antibodies (aCL). METHODS: We included 30 patients diagnosed of thrombosis associated with aCL, 52 patients who suffered from anaphylaxis due to seeds or fruits, and 120 control patients. Haematological, cardiopulmonary vascular and rheumatologic studies had been performed as needed. In vivo and in vitro allergy tests with a large battery of vegetal allergens were carried out in all the patients. Measurement of IgG aCL antibodies and specific IgE to vegetal food was done by ELISA and CAP-FEIA (Phadia). Immunodetection and inhibitions with lipoproteins belonging to seeds were performed. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of the patients diagnosed as having antiphospholipid primary syndrome had specific IgE against different proteins from different vegetable allergens, most of them seeds, and clearly against lipoproteins that were also recognised by the patients with food anaphylaxis but not by the control cases. Among the patients with anaphylaxis, 28% had anticardiolipin antibodies and 17.3% thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that seed lipoproteins which cause severe food anaphylaxis might have a potential role in the antiphospholipid syndrome and related thrombosis.
