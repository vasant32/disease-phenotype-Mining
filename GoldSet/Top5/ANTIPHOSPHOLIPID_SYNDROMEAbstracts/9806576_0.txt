OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the relationship between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genotypes and patients with recurrent fetal miscarriage who are positive for anticardiolipin antibody. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: Institutional practice at the outpatient clinic for infertility, Niigata University Medical Hospital. PATIENT(S): Patients with recurrent fetal miscarriage who were positive for anticardiolipin antibody and normal fertile women. INTERVENTION(S): Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral mononuclear cells. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Human leukocyte antigen class II genotype was determined using a polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULT(S): The frequencies of DRB1*0403 and DRB1*0410 were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group. The frequency of DRB1*04 also was significantly higher in the patient group. As for HLA-DQ genotype, the frequency of HLA-DQB1*0501 was significantly lower in the patient group. CONCLUSION: Human leukocyte antigen systems appear to be involved in the genesis of antiphospholipid syndrome.
