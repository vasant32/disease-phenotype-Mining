Thrombophilias are inherited or acquired conditions that predispose individuals to thromboembolism. Thrombophilic disorders increase obstetric complications, such as early pregnancy loss, fetal growth retardation, placental abruption, and preeclampsia. Recurrent pregnancy loss affects 1% to 3% of women of reproductive age, and a large proportion of these losses remain unexplained. Thrombophilic defects were found in 49% to 65% of women with pregnancy complications compared with 18% to 22% of women with normal pregnancies, suggesting a 3- to 8-fold increase in risk. We report a case of a pregnant woman who had a history of recurrent pregnancy losses that was complicated with protein S deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase mutation, and antiphospholipid syndrome in her pregnancy.
