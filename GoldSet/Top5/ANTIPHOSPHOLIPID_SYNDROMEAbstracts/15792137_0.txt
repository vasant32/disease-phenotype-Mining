Ischemic disorders of brain blood circulation caused by brain artery thrombosis due to antiphospholipids-induced anticoagulopathy are main neurological appearances of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS). A number of neurological disorders in patients with PAPS are the result of primary involvement of the brain and peripheral nervous system. We analyzed the spectrum of neurological non-ischemic PAPS manifestations in 125 patients (102 female, 23 male, mean age--37.5 +/- 11.3 years) with definite PAPS. These manifestations included headache (67%), epileptic seizures (23%), chorea (15%), optic neuropathy (9%), peripheral neuropathy (6%), multiple sclerosis like syndrome (MSLS) (8%), acute psychosis (2%), myasthenic syndrome (1%), non-vascular parkinsonism (1%). In the development of non-ischemic PAPS manifestations, antiphospholipids as well as other antibodies produced as a result of immune disregulation (antibodies to acetylcholine receptors in myasthenic syndrome, antineuronal antibodies in MSLS) may have pathogenic significance. In some cases a role of infection involved in PAPS manifestation cannot be ruled out.
