The predictive value (PV) and association of 4 antiphospholipid antibodies with clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) were evaluated in 90 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 100 with APS. Patients with APS were classified into arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, and pregnancy morbidity subgroups. IgG, IgM, and IgA anticardiolipin (aCL), antiphosphatidylserine (aPS), anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I (anti-B2GPI), and antiprothrombin (aPT) antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Individually, anti-B2GPI and aPS antibodies had the strongest PV for APS (86.4%-94.1%; P < .001) in patients with SLE. The PV for APS reached 100% when 2 or more antibodies were present. Similarly, anti-B2GPI and aPS antibodies had a stronger PV and association for arterial thrombosis (87%-95%; P < .001) compared with venous thrombosis (80%-92%; P = .01). Weak PV and association with pregnancy morbidity were seen with all antibodies. These results suggest an important pathogenic role of anti-B2GPI antibodies in arterial thrombosis. In addition, anti-B2GPI and aPS antibodies seem to provide the best diagnostic value for the laboratory assessment of APS.
