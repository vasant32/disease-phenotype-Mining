The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is the most common acquired thrombophilia; it is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis and/or pregnancy loss, in association with circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. The pathogenic mechanisms in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome that lead to in vivo injury are incompletely understood. Like other autoimmune diseases, a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved. We report the case of a 50-year-old woman suffering from an antero-lateral non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. After few days, coronary angiography showed a severe occlusive arterial disease, involving anterior descending, circumflex e right coronary arteries. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed with the implantation of a drug-eluting stent in the proximal segment of the anterior descending coronary artery. One day after discharge (10 days after the first hospitalization) the patient experienced dizziness, nausea, vomiting, swelling in absence of any electrocardiographic abnormalities or myocardial enzyme elevation; then she was hospitalized in the neurology department. Because of a similar episode, urgent cerebral computed tomography scan was performed 5 days later; it revealed two different acute ischemic areas, parietal in the right hemisphere and cerebellar in the left hemisphere. The diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome was confirmed by high anticardiolipin antibody titers, also present in medium titer at 5 and 17 weeks apart. She was discharged without any sequelae, on warfarin and double antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel for 6 months), then warfarin and aspirin.
