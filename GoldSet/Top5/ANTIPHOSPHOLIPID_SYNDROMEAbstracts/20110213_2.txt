Prothrombotic risk factors in children with ischemic stroke have been increasingly recognized with recent developments in technology. Extensive evaluation including a detailed family history is required to identify various inherited or acquired prothrombotic conditions. We report a 7-month-old male who presented with right hemiparesis. Acute cerebral infarction in the area supplied by the left lenticulostriate artery was confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging. De novo synthesis of antiphospholipid antibodies and homozygous methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism were identified as presumed prothrombotic risk factors. His twin sister and mother were also positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. Multiple risk factors for ischemic stroke should be considered, particularly in the perinatal and infancy period. This case also underlines the rare familial occurrence of antiphospholipid antibodies and its relationship to ischemic stroke in infancy.
