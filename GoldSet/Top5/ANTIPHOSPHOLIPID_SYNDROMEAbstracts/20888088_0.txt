Studies have shown a protective effect of hydroxychloroquine on thrombosis in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that this molecule was able to restore the anticoagulant action of annexin A5, which is reduced in presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Hydroxychloroquine use may be a new approach of the prevention of thrombosis in the antiphospholipid syndrome, which remains to be validated by well-conducted clinical trials.
