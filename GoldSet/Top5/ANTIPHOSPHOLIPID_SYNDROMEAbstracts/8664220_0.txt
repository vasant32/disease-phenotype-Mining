Clinical analysis was performed on anti-cardiolipin x beta2 glycoprotein 1 (ACL x beta2 GP1) antibody positive patients with collagen vascular diseases. Nine patients out of 89 showed positive aCL x beta2 GP1 antibody which was a relatively lower percentage compared to that of othoffanti-phospholipid antibodies, such as anti-cardiolipin antibody (23 out of 58), lupus anti-coagulant (15 out of 51) or biological false positive (BFP) test for syphilis (10 out of 50). However, 8 patients out of 9 with positive aCL x beta2 GP1 antibody showed thrombotic lesions, a relatively higher frequency compared to that seen in aCL x beta2 GP1 negative patients. Among these cutaneous manifestations, livedo reticularis and palmar nodules with histopathological evidence of thrombosis were the most characteristic features. All but one patient with palmar nodules showed positive aCL x beta2 GP1 antibody, anti-cardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant.
