There is scarce information about ischemic stroke in young adults in Thailand. The purpose of this study was to explore the causes of ischemic stroke in Thai adults age 16-50 years. All ischemic strokes treated in persons in this age range between August 2006 and December 2008 were prospectively included. Stroke subtypes were classified according to Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria as large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA), cardioembolism (CE), small-artery occlusion (SAO), stroke of other determined cause (OC), or stroke of undetermined cause (UND). The study group comprised 99 patients, with a mean age of 40 years and a mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 8. In patients age <41 years, UND (32%; P = .0652) and OC (30%; P = .0167) were the most common stroke subtypes. In patients age 41-50 years, SAO (29%; P = .0947) and UND (21%) were the most common subtypes. Antiphospholipid syndrome (6%) and neurosyphilis (4%) were the leading causes of the OC subtype. Hyperlipidemia, smoking, and hypertension were common risk factors. Although the distribution of stroke subtypes was comparable with that found in previous studies from other countries, the identified causes were different.
