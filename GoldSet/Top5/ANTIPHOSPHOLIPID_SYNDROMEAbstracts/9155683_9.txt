Bone marrow necrosis (BMN) is a relatively rare entity and has been associated with a poor prognosis. It is most commonly found in patients with neoplastic disorders, severe infections and sickle cell anemia. An unusual case of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with extensive bone marrow necrosis is described in a 27 year old woman. The patient presented with severe pancytopenia, some cognitive impairment resulting from a previous cerebrovascular accident, fever, hypertension, dyspnoea, tachycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, and vaginal bleeding. Her laboratory findings included a strongly positive Coombs' test (anti-IgG and anti-C3d), a prothrombin time of 23 seconds and an activated partial thromboplastin time of 45 seconds. Anticardiolipin antibody tests were positive. Antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies were negative but the anti-SM test was positive. A bone marrow biopsy specimen was reported as showing extensive necrosis. The patient was treated with steroids, transfusion, and plasma exchange with some clinical improvement but her pancytopenia did not respond and necessitated frequent transfusions. This case lends further support to the association between APS and BMN.
