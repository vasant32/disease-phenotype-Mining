The purpose of the present study was to determine whether using an extended panel of laboratory tests increases the detection of a hypercoagulable state in patients with ocular thromboses. Twenty consecutive patients with ocular thromboses (vein, artery, or choriocapillaris occlusions) underwent testing for activated protein C resistance/factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, hyperhomocysteinemia, and deficiencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin. For each patient, we selected two age-matched and gender-matched individuals without ocular thromboses as controls. Sixteen of the 20 patients (80%) had one or more laboratory tests that supported a hypercoagulable condition. Prothrombin G20210A (P < 0.02) and hyperhomocysteinemia (P < 0.0006) were significantly more frequent in ocular thrombosis patients compared with controls. The most common condition was antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, present in 40% of patients (confirmed by repeat testing at least 6 weeks later), but this did not reach statistical significance compared with the controls. No patients with ocular thromboses had hereditary abnormalities of protein S, protein C, or antithrombin. In conclusion, an extended panel of laboratory tests improved the detection of a hypercoagulable state in ocular thromboses. Testing for homocysteine, antiphospholipid antibodies, and the prothrombin G20210A mutation should be considered in patients with ocular thromboses.
