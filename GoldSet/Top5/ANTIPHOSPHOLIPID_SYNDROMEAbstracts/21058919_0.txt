The antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by the presence of arterial or venous thrombosis or recurrent miscarriages in a patient with positive laboratory tests for antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies and/or lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein I). Despite the strong association between antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombosis and obstetric morbidity, their pathogenic role in the development of these clinical features has not been fully elucidated. However, the knowledge of new pathogenic mechanisms might identify novel therapeutic targets and therefore may improve the management of these patients.
