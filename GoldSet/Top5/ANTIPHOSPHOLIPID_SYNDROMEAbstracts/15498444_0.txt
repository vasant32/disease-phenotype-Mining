 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We decided to describe the demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of a series of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (Harris criteria) and review other Spanish published series. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We describe 112 patients with APS, 50 primary (PAPS) and 62 secondary (SAPS) -56 (90%) to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-, monitorized in two referral centers in Malaga (Spain) from 1989 to 2000. All data were obtained from the medical records by means of a protocol. RESULTS: The age was similar in both groups (42.3 [14.7] years for the whole series). Patients with SAPS had an earlier onset of the disease (29.6 [12.6] years, vs 37.0 [13.9] years in PAPS) and they had a longer evolution of the disease (143.3 [115.5] months, vs 83.5 [73.5] months in PAPS). There was a female predominance (84% and 60% in SAPS and PAPS, respectively). The prevalences of arterial (43%) and venous thrombosis (39%), fetal loss (40%), premature births (9%), anticardiolipin antibodies (88%) and lupus anticoagulant (54%) were similar in both groups. The prevalence of ANA-IFI, thrombocytopenia and autoimmune anemia was higher in SAPS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAPS and SAPS did not present any differences in the clinical manifestations and immunological disorders of the syndrome. Those patients with SAPS were younger at the beginning of the disease and there was a female predominance. Our patients were different from those included in other Spanish published series, which could be explained by selection and classification bias.
