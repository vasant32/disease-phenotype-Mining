Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a cause of infertility and fetal loss. Ovarian stimulation can induce previously unknown APS. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHS) is uncommon but potentially life-threatening, as well as catastrophic APS. A woman that simultaneously developed a severe OHS and a catastrophic APS is described in this paper. Both entities produced thrombotic cardiac and brain thrombosis. A peculiar mechanism of cardiac ischemia is also described. In spite of the life-threatening risk of this situation, the indication for preventive anti-aggregation and/or anticoagulation is not clear.
