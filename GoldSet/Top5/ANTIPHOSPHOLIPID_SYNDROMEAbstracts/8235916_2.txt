Renal artery infarction is a very rare complication in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), even in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome which often causes thromboembolism: Renal infarctions have only been reported in 4 SLE patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Here we report a case of SLE without aPL who accompanied by renal and cerebral infarctions. A 42-year old Japanese woman with 8 year history of SLE manifested by arthralgia, central nervous system symptoms, positive-antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of progressive lupus nephritis. Physical examinations revealed hypertension (130-160/80-110 mmHg) without pitting pretibial edema. Laboratory evaluations showed proteinuria (3.7 g/day), normal serum creatinine level (0.9 mg/dl), low serum albumin level (2.3 g/dl) and high cholesterol level (317 mg/dl). Old cerebral infarctions were recognized by magnetic resonance imaging. However, hematological and immunological studies revealed that this case has neither a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, lupus anticoagulant nor anticardiolipin antibodies. Prednisolone was increased from 30 mg/every other day to 30 mg/day, and oral azathioprine, 50 mg/day, was started for the treatment of lupus nephritis. On the 11th day, she suddenly complained severe abdominal pain, which gradually localized on the right side. Computed tomography of the kidney suggested right renal infarctions, and arteriography of right renal artery confirmed both an obstruction of the ventral branch and a narrowing of the dorsal branch of right renal artery. No intra-cardiac thrombus was demonstrated by echocardiography. Following to the treatment with fibrinolytic agent and anticoagulant, her symptoms have improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
