In this study, 99mTc-hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) SPECT was used to evaluate the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the brain in patients with primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (PAPS). METHODS: Twenty-two women who were PAPS patients, aged 28-60 y, with mild neuropsychiatric manifestations and normal brain MRI findings were enrolled in this study. Brain HMPAO SPECT was performed to detect brain abnormalities. Meanwhile, serum anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and lupus anticoagulant (LA) were measured. RESULTS: HMPAO SPECT revealed hypoperfusion lesions in 16 of 22 (73%) PAPS patients. Cerebral cortex and cerebellum were the most and the least commonly involved areas, respectively. Eighteen of 22 (82%) and 14 of 22 (64%) patients had positive ACA and positive LA, respectively. ACA and LA results were related to HMPAO SPECT findings. CONCLUSION: HMPAO SPECT is a sensitive tool for detecting brain abnormalities in PAPS patients with only mild neuropsychiatric manifestations and normal brain MRI findings.
