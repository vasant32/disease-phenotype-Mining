Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare cause of pulmonary hypertension (PH); Antiphospholipid antibody (APL) is another known cause of pulmonary hypertension, due to recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism. The coincidence of both causes, PVOD and APL, without thromboembolism, in PH has not been reported previously in children. A 12.5-year-old boy presented with a one year history of fatigue. Pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed by echocardiography. Pulmonary function tests revealed a moderate restrictive pattern and elevated granulocytes were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage. An isolated high-titer APL was detected. Open lung biopsy established the diagnosis of PVOD, with no evidence of pulmonary thrombosis, but with accompanying interstitial and alveolar cellular infiltration. We speculate that APL may have played a role in the pathogenesis of PVOD. Prednisone++ improved the symptoms of the interstitial pneumonitis and was stopped; on follow up of 30 months, the patient ist in stable condition on therapy with nifedipin, phenprocoumon and digoxin. CONCLUSIONS: PVOD and APL may be present simultaneously as a rare cause of PH. Interstitial pneumonitis may accompany PVOD and produce the leading symptoms. Open lung biopsy is essential for early establishment of the diagnosis.
