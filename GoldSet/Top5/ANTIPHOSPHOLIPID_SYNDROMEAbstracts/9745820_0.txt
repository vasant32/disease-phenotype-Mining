A severe case of retinal vascular occlusion in a 31 year old white female is reported. Its origin is attributed to the primary antiphospholipid syndrome. The diagnostic criteria and the treatment of the primary antiphospholipid syndrome are revised and discussed. When the etiology of a retinal vascular occlusion is not assessed by the initial work-up, especially if the initial presentation consists of a severe occlusive disease, antiphospholipid antibodies should be checked.
