Antiphospholipid syndrome can sometimes mimic multiple sclerosis symptoms and, therefore, present difficulties at the time of diagnosis. We describe the cases of two young women with recurrent neurological deficiencies, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in serum, and typical demyelinating lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. Initiation of anticoagulant therapy did not result in any new neurological events in either patient.
