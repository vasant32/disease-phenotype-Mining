Antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) were studied in 30 women with a history of recurrent fetal losses. An increased level of anticardiolipin antibodies was found in 7(23.3%) of them, being high and moderate in 4 women. Lupus anticoagulant was present in 9(30.0%) examinees. None cases of SLE were diagnosed. Diagnostically significant APA levels were associated with moderate symptomless thrombocytopenia. 12 of 13 women with antiphospholipid syndrome markers had definite (livedo reticularis, damage of cardiac valves, recurrent thrombophlebitis, leg ulcers, stroke, migraine) and possible (moderate arterial hypertension, proteinuria, retina angiopathy) extragenital features of this disorder. The most serious vascular complications took place in the group with high and moderate levels of anticardiolipin antibodies IgG.
