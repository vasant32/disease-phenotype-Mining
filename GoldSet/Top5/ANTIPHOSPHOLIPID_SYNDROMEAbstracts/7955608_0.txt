Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is a rare complication of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). We report a case of IVC thrombosis in a 27 year-old female who was anticoagulated at the time and who had a history of recurrent deep venous thromboses (DVT), thrombocytopenia and antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL).
