In patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) have been reported to be associated with more severe manifestations including digital infarct, gangrene and pulmonary hypertension. But these findings are not consistent in all studies; moreover, there are no data available from Indian subcontinent. The objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in Indian SSc patients and correlate them with clinical and immunological features. Seventy-two patients were recruited prospectively from rheumatology clinic from 2002 to 2006. Their medical records were reviewed. Anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG, IgM) by ELISA and lupus anticoagulant (LA) were tested in standardized pattern and repeated after 6 weeks. Anti-β2 glycoprotein-I antibodies were done in patients who had aPL antibodies. Nineteen patients had diffuse cutaneous SSc and 53 had limited disease. Seven patients (9.7%) were positive for aPL antibodies in their sera. Only one patient had clinical features of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and manifested with recurrent abortions and deep vein thrombosis. She was positive for aCL, LA and anti-β2 glycoprotein-I antibodies. Four patients were only aCL (IgG) positive in moderate titers and one each had only aCL (IgM) and LAC positivity. None of the clinical parameters showed an association with aPL antibody.
