 INTRODUCTION: Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is a life-threatening disorder urgent for aggressive treatment, and its characterized systemic thromboses and coagulopathy prompt for a rapid diagnosis. CASE REPORT: A woman fell into unconsciousness two weeks after a stable course of massive cerebral ischemia was identified due to CAPS with Sjogren syndrome. Her thrombocyte count and coagulation times were was normal at initial. A high blood anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I antibody level was found. Plasmapheresis rapidly reversed her consciousness and coagulation function. CONCLUSIONS: A normal hemostatic parameters should not exclude CAPS. A favorable prognosis depends on the rapidity of appropriate treatment.
