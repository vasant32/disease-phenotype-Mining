We describe a patient with previous venous thrombosis while using oral contraceptives and recurrent pregnancy loss, who presented with massive hepatic infarction in the last trimester of the fourth gestation. Thrombocytopenia, the lupus anticoagulant (LA) and the anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) were detected and a diagnosis of a 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was made. The clinical and histological manifestations and the differential diagnosis, especially with DIC and pre-eclampsia, are discussed.
