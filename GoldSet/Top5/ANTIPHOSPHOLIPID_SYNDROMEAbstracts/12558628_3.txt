Anetoderma is characterized by a loss of normal elastic tissue that presents clinically as localized areas of wrinkled or flaccid skin. We describe the case of a 30-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus-associated anetoderma and positive anti-phospholipid antibodies. We discuss the possible role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of anetoderma, and, when detected, the need to check for an associated anti-phospholipid syndrome in such patients.
