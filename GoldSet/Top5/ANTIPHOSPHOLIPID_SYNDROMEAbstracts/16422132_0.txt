The classical clinical picture of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by venous and/or arterial thromboses, fetal losses and thrombocytopenia, in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). We present the case of a young male patient who suffered a transient ischemic cerebrovascular attack and whose cardiac investigation revealed a cardiac source of embolus, namely non-bacterial vegetations of the mitral valve. Laboratory testing confirmed the diagnosis of primary APS.
