Anti-apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1) autoantibodies were described in autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and might be involved in the genesis of arterial and venous thrombotic events. To investigate the presence of these autoantibodies in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without other features of autoimmunity, we set up an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-Apo A-1 antibodies. We used it to investigate their prevalence in ACS as compared to SLE and APS and correlated them to plasma Apo A-1 and serum amyloid A protein (SAA) concentrations. The prevalence of anti-Apo A-1 autoantibodies in the healthy control group was 1% (1/92), but was significantly higher in other groups: 21% (11/53) in ACS group (P=0.001), 13% (12/92) in SLE and/or APS group (P=0.005). Multiple linear regression revealed a significant correlation between plasma Apo A-1 (r=-0.72, P=0.013), plasma SAA concentration (r=0.76, P=0.0066) and anti-Apo A-1 IgG titre in ACS patients. The presence of anti-Apo A-1 autoantibodies in patients with ACS highlights an additional link between autoimmunity, inflammation and atherosclerosis.
