 OBJECTIVE: To investigate precocious alterations in the artery wall of patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). METHODS: We evaluated flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery and intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid arteries in 16 patients and 16 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and other cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: FMD of the brachial artery was significantly lower in patients than in controls (6.3 +/- 5.2% vs 18.2 +/- 2.7; P < .005). IMT was similar in the 2 groups. FMD was significantly reduced in patients with anticardiolipin antibodies IgM. CONCLUSIONS: APS correlates closely with precocious atherosclerosis, and the correlation with a type of anticardiolipin antibody may be predictive of more accelerated atherosclerosis.
