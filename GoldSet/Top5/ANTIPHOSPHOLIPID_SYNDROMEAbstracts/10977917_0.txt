Natural latent human antibodies cross-reacting with DNA and cardiolipin, interact with human endothelial cells, decrease antiaggregation activity of rat aortic wall, and increase fibrinolytic activity of the wall of the inferior vena cava. It is assumed that natural antiphospholipid antibodies present in immunoglobulin preparations in a latent state modify antithrombogenic activity of the vascular wall and are a potential cause of antiphospholipid syndrome.
