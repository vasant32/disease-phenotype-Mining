Cardiac valve involvement in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) has been consistently shown. However, isolated tricuspid valve disease within this syndrome has only been recently reported. We report a patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome who had isolated tricuspid organic valve disease, pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary thromboembolism. We suggest that the APS should be listed as one of the aetiologies of organic isolated tricuspid valve disease in the adult population.
