 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cerebral blood flow abnormalities in primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) patients without ongoing neurological manifestations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 28 PAPS patients and 28 healthy controls. Carotid Doppler ultrasound, and echocardiographic evaluation were done. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography measured mean flow velocity (MFV) in the carotid siphon, middle, anterior, posterior, intracranial vertebral arteries, and basilar artery (11 cerebral arteries). Results were considered abnormal when the MFV was out of the normal range according to age and/or flow asymmetry and/or more than four arterial segments affected. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 41.4 ± 11.2 and 39.3 ± 8.6 years in controls. Disease duration was 11 ± 2.7 years. A significant increase in MFV in 7/11 cerebral arteries in PAPS patients, mainly in the middle and anterior cerebral arteries was found compared with controls. A significant association between lupus anticoagulant, history of stroke and obesity with a greater number of affected arteries was found. We did not find an association between MFV and abnormal echocardiography, arterial hypertension and carotid intima-media thickness. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic patients with PAPS can have significantly increased MFVs. These alterations may be the consequence of accelerated atherosclerosis, PAPS vasculopathy or both. Whatever the cause, these findings can represent a risk for stroke in PAPS patients that needs the trial of other therapeutic options.
