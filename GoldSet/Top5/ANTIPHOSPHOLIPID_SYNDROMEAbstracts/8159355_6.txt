BACKGROUND: Primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is a clinical entity that may threaten the health of both fetus and mother. CASE: We report a fatal case of primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in a woman who developed catastrophic disease due to multisystem thrombosis in the postpartum period following a fetal death. Three years before her admission, primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of high titers of immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin antibody, a positive lupus anticoagulant, a false-positive VDRL, and fibrin deposits in the biopsy of a palmar lesion. CONCLUSION: The physician must recognize the potentially catastrophic complications of pregnancy and the postpartum period in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, and appropriate patient counseling should be provided.
