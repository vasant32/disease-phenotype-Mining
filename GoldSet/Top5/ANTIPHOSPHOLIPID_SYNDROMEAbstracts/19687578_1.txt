 PURPOSE: This study was carried out to clarify the relationship of IgG phosphatidylserine-dependent anti-prothrombin antibody (aPS/PT), IgG beta 2 glycoprotein I-dependent anticardiolipin antibody (beta 2-GPI aCL), and lupus anticoagulant (LA) to cerebral infarction, using data from 93 patients who visited our hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We computed the positive rates for each of IgG aPS/PT, beta 2-GPI aCL, and LA in the 93 patients with cerebral infarction, and carried out logistic regression analysis with IgG aPS/PT as the outcome variable and with beta 2-GPI aCL, LA, and each risk factor as predictor variables in order to assess the relationship of IgG aPS/PT with each factor. RESULTS: IgG aPS/PT was more highly correlated with LA than beta 2-GPI aCL in IgG aPS/PT-positive patients with cerebral infarction. IgG aPS/PT itself appears to have high specificity as a marker for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), because there were patients who were IgG aPS/PT-positive but both beta 2-GPI aCL- and LA-negative. CONCLUSION: In IgG aPS/PT-positive patients with cerebral infarction, IgG aPS/PT is more highly correlated with LA than beta 2-GPI aCL. It is also strongly associated with APS. Measurement of IgG aPS/PT in patients with cerebral infarction could be of diagnostic value.
