OBJECTIVE: The link between specific antibodies and atherogenesis in primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) is less strong than for thrombosis, although clearly the two processes are related and thrombosis is the main complication of atherosclerosis, a process known as atherothrombosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of serum lipid levels and anti-oxidized LDL (oxLDL) antibodies on the clinical features of 42 patients with PAPS (mean age 40.45+/-13.37; 32 women and 10 men), and to compare them with 47 control subjects (mean age 39.68+/-13.93; 33 women and 14 men). METHODS: Total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride concentrations were determined by enzymatic methods. LDL was calculated according to the Friedwald formula. Anticardiolipin, anti-oxidized LDL and anti-Beta2glycoprotein I antibodies were detected by ELISA. RESULTS: A significant association was found between arterial events and triglyceride, LDL and cholesterol concentrations, but multivariate analysis showed that cholesterol concentrations were the most important predictor of arterial events (p=0.012). Cerebrovascular insults were the most significantly associated with cholesterol concentrations (p=0.011). Myocardial infarctions were more frequently present in patients more than 40 years of age (p=0.032). No significant association of the investigated parameters with venous thromboses was found. Recurrent abortions were not associated with the presence or concentrations of the investigated parameters. Although patients had increased concentrations of anti-oxLDL antibodies, no significant association was found between the titres of anti-oxLDL antibodies and clinical features of APS. CONCLUSION: In patients with PAPS, lipid concentrations are a better predictor for arterial events than anti-oxLDL antibodies.
