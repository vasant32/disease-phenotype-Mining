Systemic lupus erythematosus can be complicated by the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The clinical manifestations of this syndrome most often documented thus far are recurrent deep venous thrombosis, recurrent spontaneous abortions, and cerebral vascular accidents. Abdominal ischemic events have received relatively little attention in prior reports. We report on a lupus patient with lupus anticoagulant positivity who presented with abdominal pain, anorexia, and weight loss who was subsequently diagnosed with gastric ulcers and pancreatitis. Computerized tomography of the abdomen in addition revealed splenic and kidney infarcts. We conclude that this patient had (ischemic) chronic pancreatitis with pseudocysts and splenic and renal infarcts probably due to secondary APS.
