Phospholipids are abundantly represented within the nervous system. Aim of our study was to evaluate the presence and fine specificity of anti phospholipid antibodies (aPLAb) among patients with monoclonal gammopathy associated neuropathy. Thirty nine percent of these patients had high titers of aPLAb, mostly associated with low levels of anti beta2 glycoprotein I, which suggests different antibody specificity compared to patients with anti phospholipid syndrome. Further 6/48 patients with dysimmune neuropathy without monoclonal gammopathy had positive aPLAb titers. APLAb strongly cross-reacted with sulfatide. These findings suggest an adjuntive role of aPLAb on nerve damage and may help to better understand the nerve binding properties of anti-sulfatide antibodies.
