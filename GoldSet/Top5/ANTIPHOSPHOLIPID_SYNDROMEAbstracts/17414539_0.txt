Relapsing splenic vein thrombosis, a very rare complication of Wegener granulomatosis (WG), is described in a female patient. Positive antiphospholipid antibodies found in this case are a rare occurrence in primary vasculitis, especially in WG. This probably caused or accentuated an effect of the WG on the splenic vein. Treatment of such patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and WG must include anticoagulation and immunosuppression and, as noted in this patient, the splenic vein thrombosis and other antiphospholipid syndrome and WG can resolve quickly.
