Antibodies to beta 2-glycoprotein in the serum of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) were found by many investigators, but their results appeared contraversional. We studied clinical significance of antibodies to beta 2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta 2-GPI) in patients with SLE. 69 patients with verified SLE were examined for lupus anticoagulant (LA), antibodies to cardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta 2-GPI. 44(65%), 46(67%), 49(71%), 19(28%), 16(23%) patients were positive for LA, IgG-aCL, IgM-aCL, IgG-anti-beta 2-GPI and IgM-anti-beta 2-GPI, respectively. Hyperproduction of IgG-anti-beta 2-GPI correlated with APS development as a whole, its separate clinical symptoms (venous and arterial thromboembolism, obstetric pathology and thrombocytopenia) and some comcomitant clinical signs (trophic crural ulcer, hemolytic anemia, valvular heart disorders). Moreover, an increase in concentration of IgM-anti-beta 2-GPI was associated with habitual abortion. Both isotypes of anti-beta 2-GPI occurred more frequently in the sera positive by LA and aCL. It is interesting that we discovered IgG-anti-beta 2-GPI more often in early than late postthrombolytic period. Thus, anti-2b2-GPI is a new serological marker of APS. Its detection is clinically important for upgrading diagnosis of APS.
