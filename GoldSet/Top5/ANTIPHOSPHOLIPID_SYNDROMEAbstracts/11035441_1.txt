Erythema nodosum is a dermatologic condition characterized by painful, erythematous nodules on the anterior surfaces of the lower extremities. Its association with a variety of conditions has been previously described. We present three cases of erythema nodosum in patients with elevated anticardiolipin antibodies. In one patient, a temporal relationship was seen in the simultaneous detection of antibodies and skin lesions. We propose an association between erythema nodosum and the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS).
