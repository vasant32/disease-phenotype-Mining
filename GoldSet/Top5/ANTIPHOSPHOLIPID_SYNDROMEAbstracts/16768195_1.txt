 PURPOSE: To report a case of third, fourth, and six cranial nerve palsies with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). METHODS: Medical records of a 16-year-old female diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in primary APS were reviewed. RESULTS: A 16-year-old female presented with headache and diplopia. Ocular examinations revealed marked bilateral disc edema. She was unable to depress, adduct, and abduct in left eye and had limited abduction in the right eye. Cerebrospinal fluid had a normal composition and a pressure of 400 mmH20. Lupus anticoagulant and IgG anticardiolipin antibody were positive. There was no clinical evidence of other autoimmune disease. Brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR angiography, and conventional angiogram with venous phase were normal. She was diagnosed with bilateral sixth, and left third and fourth cranial nerve palsies secondary to idiopathic intracranial hypertension in primary APS. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first reported case of concurrent third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsies in a patient with primary APS.
