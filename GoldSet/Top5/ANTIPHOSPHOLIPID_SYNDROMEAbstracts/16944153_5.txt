Survival rate and causes of death according to the period of diagnosis and four accompanying organ disorders were analyzed in 306 Japanese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The survival rate was gradually improved, and the survival rate during 5- and 10-year periods of the patients diagnosed in 1990-2004 was 94 and 92%, 20-year period of those in 1980-1989 was 77%, 30-year period of those in 1975-1979 was 71%, respectively. Survival rate of those with serositis, pulmonary hypertension, and positive family history tended to be reduced, while that of the cases with neuropsychiatric disorder and renal disorder was significantly reduced. Overlapping of these organ disorders was an important factor for a poor prognosis. Bronchopneumonia and cerebrovascular accidents were frequent causes of death, and treatment for anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome and life-style diseases such as hypertension and arteriosclerosis was thought to be important for a good outcome.
