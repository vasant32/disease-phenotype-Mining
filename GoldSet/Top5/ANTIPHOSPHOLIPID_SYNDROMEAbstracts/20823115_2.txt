Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a multisystemic disorder of coagulation-causing thrombosis in the arterial and venous system as well as pregnancy-related complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery and pre-eclampsia. The disease is characterized by the autoimmune production of antibodies against phospholipid, a substance found in the cell membrane. We here report the case of a patient with four second trimester miscarriages, who apart from a heterozygous plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 mutation, had no risk factors explaining her condition. In the subsequent pregnancy she was therefore put on low-molecular-weight heparin, aspirin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Antiphospholipid antibodies (APL), which had been negative before gestation, increased and remained high throughout pregnancy, thus suggesting a pregnancy-induced or -aggravated APS. The patient was kept on the above-mentioned medication and delivered a healthy male baby by Caesarean section after an otherwise uneventful pregnancy. Thus, in order to diagnose and treat pregnancy-triggered APS in patients with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, screening for APL should also be performed at several time points after conception.
