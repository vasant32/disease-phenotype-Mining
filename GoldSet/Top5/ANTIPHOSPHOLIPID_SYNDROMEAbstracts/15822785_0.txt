20 medical abortions and uterine scrapes from 24 females with verified antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) were studied by light and electron microscopy. Principle parts of pathogenesis are distinguished in the mother organism, target-organs, placenta and uterine-placental region. Morphological criteria of APS diagnosis, in part histo-ultrastructural, pathology of microvilli of brush-border, pathology of syncitiotrophoblast and villous cytotrophoblast. Rheological disturbances dominated in the parietal endometrium in the form of increasing hypercoagulative stratifying hemorrhages, thrombosis of uterine-placental arteries and microvessels, frequent formation of retroplacental hematoma. These structural straits are recommended for practical use in the work of pathologists.
