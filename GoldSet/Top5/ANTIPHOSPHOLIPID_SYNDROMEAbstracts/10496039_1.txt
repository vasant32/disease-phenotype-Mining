A 60-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital in February 1993 due to dizziness, dyspnea, abdominal pain, and high susceptibility to bleeding. Physical examination revealed livedo reticularis of the foot, but did not detect hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of the peripheral blood detected pancytopenia, leukoerythroblastosis, and tear-drop erythrocytes. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) was diagnosed on the basis of bone marrow biopsy findings. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was confirmed by positive response to anti-cardiolipin antibody and recurrent splenic infarction. Because of factor XIII deficiency, the patient experienced severe gingival bleeding after tooth extraction. Her condition was complicated by mesenteric arterial thromboembolism and she died of sepsis 5 years after onset. Although the incidence of immunopathy in PMF patients is high, few studies to date have focused on APS patients presenting with a variety of severe embolic symptoms. Our patient required careful monitoring due to bleeding tendency and thromboemboli.
