 BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is unclear and the prognosis is poor. Few studies have been published focusing on Chinese patients with TTP-HUS. We performed a retrospective study on the clinical characteristics and outcome of Chinese patients with TTP-HUS. METHOD: Patients with TTP-HUS, admitted to our hospital from 1998 to 2006, were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 26 females and 6 males in our study. Fifteen patients had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-associated TTP-HUS; 2 had pregnancy-associated TTP-HUS; 1 had antiphospholipid syndrome-associated TTP-HUS; 2 had drug-associated TTP-HUS; 4 had malignant angionephrosclerosis- associated TTP-HUS; 3 had vasculitis-associated TTP-HUS, and the remaining 5 had idiopathic TTP-HUS. Twenty-six patients had acute kidney injury and 21 had nephrotic syndrome. Hypertension was found in 31 patients. For the treatment, 15 patients had plasmapheresis, 12 had continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration and 14 had hemodialysis. Eighteen patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. Corticosteroids were used in patients with idiopathic TTP-HUS. For the patients with SLE-associated TTP-HUS, corticosteroids and immunosuppressant were used. Outcome was poor: 6 patients died; 17 recovered from renal insufficiency; 5 progressed to chronic renal failure, and 4 were dependent on hemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Most of our patients had secondary TTP-HUS. SLE-associated TTP-HUS is the most common form of TTP-HUS. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve prognosis. An immunosuppressant together with corticosteroids could improve prognosis in some patients.
