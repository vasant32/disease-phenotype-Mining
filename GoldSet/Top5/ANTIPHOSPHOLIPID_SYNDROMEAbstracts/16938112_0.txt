 PROBLEM: To elucidate the efficacy of the treatment using a Japanese-modified Chinese herbal medicine, Sairei-to, and low-dose aspirin with or without a corticosteroid hormone for the patients with adverse pregnancy histories positive for anti-phospholipid antibodies. METHOD OF STUDY: Fifteen cases positive for anti-phospholipid antibodies, who had experienced preterm delivery in which an extremely low birthweight infant (<1000 g) was born as a result of intrauterine growth restriction with or without severe preeclampsia, were treated with the medication according to the current protocol. Four cases with the same condition, who were treated with only low-dose aspirin, or without medication, were chosen as a control population. The pregnancy outcome was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The rate of patients in whom the next pregnancy continued until the 36th week of gestation or later was significantly higher in treated patients (80.0%) compared with the control population (0%). CONCLUSIONS: In this series, we obtained case report data that Sairei-to may provide some benefit for patients with reproductive disorders positive for anti-phospholipid antibodies; however, randomized controlled trial evidence is needed before current treatment can be recommended.
