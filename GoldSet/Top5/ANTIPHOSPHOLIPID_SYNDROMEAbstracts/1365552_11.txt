Recent reports describe the association of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) with chorea or severe heart valve lesions in systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus-like disease, or the primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. We conducted a case series and a case-control investigation of patients with rheumatic fever with Sydenham chorea or other manifestations of rheumatic fever for anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) during the acute attack and disease remission. Eighty percent of patients were positive for aCL during the rheumatic fever attack vs 40% when inactive (p = 0.035); IgG and IgM aCL increased significantly with disease activity. Individuals with or without Sydenham chorea were equally positive for aCL (76 and 83%, respectively). A significant association was found between IgM aCL and carditis: All patients with valvulitis had IgM aCL (100%) vs 37% of patients without valvular involvement (p = 0.02). aPL may play a role in the pathogenesis of some clinical manifestations of acute rheumatic fever.
