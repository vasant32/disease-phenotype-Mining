A 24-y-old male who developed necrotic lesions on the lower extremities together with testicular thrombosis necessitating orchiectomy, demonstrated high level IgG anticardiolipin (aCL) associated with acute HIV infection. This is one of the first cases describing a close relationship between viral infection and the classic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). It is well documented that HIV patients may produce antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), but the full-blown picture of the APS is distinctly uncommon with HIV or any other viral infection, possibly due to the overproduction of the IgM isotype rather than IgG aCL as in this case. The induction of thrombosis following infections has been well described in patients with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) but not in patients with the 'classic or simple' APS.
