Beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) is known as a major autoantigen for antiphospholipid antibodies. Our recent data show that binding of beta(2)GPI to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) or to liposomes containing anionic phospholipid(s) may facilitate the presentation of beta(2)GPI's epitope by macrophages/dendritic cells to autoreactive T cells. In the present study, we investigated intracellular trafficking of beta(2)GPI and its complexes with oxLDL or liposomes containing phosphatidylserine (PS-liposomes) in mouse macrophage-like J774 cells. A relatively small amount of non-complexed beta(2)GPI was taken up and stagnated in the late endosome after incubating for 16h. In contrast, beta(2)GPI complexes with oxLDL or PS-liposomes were transported into the lysosome. In the presence of the IgG anti-beta(2)GPI autoantibody, WB-CAL-1, beta(2)GPI/oxLDL complexes were rapidly incorporated into intracellular space and were finally localized in the lysosome. Interestingly, in vitro pulses by beta(2)GPI/oxLDL complexes together with WB-CAL-1 led to the expression of membranous CD36 as well as Fcgamma type I receptors (FcgammaRI). These observations suggest that IgG immune complexes of beta(2)GPI/oxLDL provide not only FcgammaRI- but also scavenger receptor-mediated uptake of beta(2)GPI/oxLDL complexes by macrophages. Thus, beta(2)GPI/oxLDL complexes as a major atherogenic autoantigen and IgG anti-beta(2)GPI autoantibodies may facilitate antigen presentation and foam cell formation in antiphospholipid syndrome.
