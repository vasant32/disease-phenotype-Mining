The remarkable effect of plasma exchange (PE) was observed on thrombocytopenia in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Three times PE led to recovery from severe thrombocytopenia refractory to treatment with corticosteroid, anticoagulant, and antiplatelet drugs accompanied by a decrease in the serum cardiolipin beta2 glycoprotein I antibody level. This result suggests that PE is a valuable therapeutic tool for refractory thrombocytopenia in APS.
