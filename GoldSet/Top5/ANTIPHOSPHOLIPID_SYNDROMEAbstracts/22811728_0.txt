Microangiopathic antiphospholipid-associated syndromes (MAPSs) are reported as encompassing several conditions mainly affecting the microvasculature of selected organs: the liver in HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet); kidney, brain, and skin in TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). It is predominant in patients with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). A recent report suggests that APS is not only a thrombotic disease but also associated with microangiopathic features, and it can explain the greater prevalence of HELLP syndrome in these patients. We here report a case of MAPS during pregnancy associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in early second trimester.
