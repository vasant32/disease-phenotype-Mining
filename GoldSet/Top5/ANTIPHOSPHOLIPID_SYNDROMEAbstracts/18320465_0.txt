A method based on histidine ligand affinity chromatography has been utilized for the separation of DNA hydrolyzing autoantibodies from sera of patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome using the gel, histidyl-aminohexyl-sepharose. The separation of autoantibodies was carried out under mild chromatographic conditions. Human IgG subclass distribution in the different fractions separated on the column was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The purified DNA hydrolyzing autoantibodies were shown to hydrolyze plasmid DNA.
