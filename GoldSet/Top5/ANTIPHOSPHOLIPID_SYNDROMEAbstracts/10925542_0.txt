Primary antiphospholipid syndrome is a condition in which antiphospholipid antibodies may be present without any associated medical disorder. Thrombosis is the hallmark of this syndrome. We report the case of a 22-year-old female with the chief complaint of floating spots in the right eye for two months. No underlying connective tissue disease or systemic disease was noted. Ophthalmic examination revealed retinal hemorrhage, retinal vein engorgement and optic disk swelling in the right eye only, and normal visual acuity in both eyes. Retinal fluorescein angiography showed venous stasis and branch vein leakage in the right eye. An antibody profile revealed the presence of immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin antibodies, which confirmed the diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
