Cross-reactions with cardiolipin antibodies and serological lues tests are common. We examined a 37 year old patient with neurological symptoms and signs of Sjoegren's syndrome and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. But the lues screening test was also positive and the serological tests following approved the lues infection. When an autoimmune disease is diagnosed with the presence of cardiolipin antibodies we recommend also testing for treponema pallidum as a possible disease.
