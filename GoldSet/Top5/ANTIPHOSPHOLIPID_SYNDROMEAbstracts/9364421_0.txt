The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, especially of the IgG isotype and in high titre, is associated with additional complications in patients with SLE. The thrombocytopaenia and cerebral events in the patient described are likely to have been linked to her lupus anticoagulant. However, the antibody and anticardiolipin antibodies are not necessarily synonymous and indeed we did not detect anticardiolipin antibodies in the patient, although her sister had them. It is likely that they represent overlapping sets of immunoglobulins. The production and analysis of further such antibodies, as described in this review, is awaited urgently. Much effort is also being expanded on identifying the precise targets for these antibodies. In a very recent report Hörkkö et al have shown that these antibodies may be directed against epitopes of oxidized phospholipids. The management of patients with complex disorders such as described here remain a challenge, although in the short term the patient's major locomotor, neurological, dermatological and haematological problems have been controlled. Long-term problems including impaired fertility and osteoporosis remain to be faced.
