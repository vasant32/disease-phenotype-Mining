Binding of beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)-GPI)-dependent anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) derived from antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is significantly reduced in aCL ELISA due to loss of the phospholipid (PL) binding property of beta(2)-GPI by plasmin treatment. In the present study, the treatment generated a nicked form of beta(2)-GPI and resulted in loss of antigenicity for the autoantibodies detected in ELISA, using an beta(2)-GPI directly adsorbed polyoxygenated carboxylated plate, the assay system of which was not related to PL binding. The nicked form bound to neither Cu(2+)-oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) nor to beta(2)-GPI-specific lipid ligands isolated from oxLDL, the result being a complete loss of subsequent binding of anti-beta(2)-GPI autoantibodies. The conformational change in the nicked domain V was predicted from its intact structure determined by an X-ray analysis (implemented in Protein Data Bank: 1C1Z), molecular modeling and epitope mapping of a monoclonal anti-beta(2)-GPI antibody, i.e. Cof-18, which recognizes the related structure. The analysis revealed that novel hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions appeared in domain V after the cleavage, thereby affecting the PL binding of beta(2)-GPI. Such a conformational change may have important implications for exposure of cryptic epitopes located in the domains such as domain IV.
