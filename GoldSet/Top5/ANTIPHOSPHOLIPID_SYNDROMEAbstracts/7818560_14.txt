OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential of bone marrow cells from mice with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) to transfer the disease to naive mice, and to determine the importance of the role of T cells in the APS. METHODS: Experimental primary APS was induced in naive mice following active immunization with anticardiolipin (aCL) monoclonal antibody (MAb). Whole-population or T cell-depleted bone marrow cells from mice with experimental primary APS were infused into total body-irradiated naive BALB/c recipients. RESULTS: Bone marrow cells (in the presence of T cells) had the potential to induce experimental APS in naive mice, which resulted in high serum titers of aCL, antiphosphatidylserine, and antiphosphatidylinositol antibodies; an increased number of antibody-forming cells specific for each of the above phospholipids; a positive lymph node cell proliferative response to aCL MAb; and clinical features of primary APS, including thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (indicating the presence of lupus anticoagulant), and a high frequency of fetal resorptions (the equivalent of human fetal loss). T cell-depleted bone marrow cells did not transfer the disease. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the important role of T cells in the development and transfer of experimental primary APS and raises the possibility of T cell manipulations in treatments to prevent this condition.
