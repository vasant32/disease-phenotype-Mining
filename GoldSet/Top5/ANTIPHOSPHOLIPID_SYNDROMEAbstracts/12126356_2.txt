Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLA) is a syndrome complex characterized by recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis, recurrent fetal wastage, thrombocytopenia and presence in serum of antibodies against negatively charged phospholipids like lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin antibody (ACLA) and subgroups. These are classified further as primary (wherein this occurs in isolation) and secondary (associated with infection, drugs and malignancies). It is uncommon to find both LA and ACLA in primary APLA syndrome (unlike as in the secondary form). Renal manifestations which include renal arterial and venous occlusion and infarction and thrombotic microangiopathy have also been infrequently described. We hereby present a case of primary APLA syndrome with unusual features of LA and ACLA occurring together and also the presence of renal failure due to left renal artery thrombosis and right renal artery occlusion.
