 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of treatment in patients suffering from recurrent spontaneous abortion and antiphospholipid syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 148 observed women suffering from recurrent abortion with presence of lupus anticoagulant antibodies (LA) and/or high moderate concentration of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) have been divided randomly into followed three treated groups: I--56 patients treated by low-dose of acetylsalicylic acid (LDA, 75 mg daily); II--39 patients treated by low molecular weight heparin (applied in dose of 20 g daily); III--53 patients treated by LDA and low molecular weight heparin simultaneously. RESULTS: It has been affirmed that coincidental application of low-dose of acetylsalicylic acid and low molecular weight heparin statistically more often increase the percentage of successful pregnancy in comparison with application of low molecular weight heparin or acetylsalicylic acid alone. In the group where only low-dose of acetylsalicylic acid was applied the success of pregnancy equaled 89.3%, in the group where only low molecular weight heparin was applied the successful pregnancy equaled 81.1% and in the group with acetylsalicylic acid and low molecular weight heparin being applied together the successful pregnancy equaled 92.5%. In has simultaneously been affirmed that the percentage of pregnancy loss is statistically higher in the women suffering from isolated occurrence of lupus anticoagulant antibodies (21.2%) in comparison with the women suffering from occurrence of anticardiolipin antibodies (6.7%) and anticardiolipin antibodies with lupus anticoagulant antibodies simultaneously. CONCLUSION: 1. Simultaneous application of low-doses of acetylsalicylic acid and low molecular weight heparin seems to be the best solution in patients suffering from recurrent spontaneous abortion and antiphospholipid syndrome. 2. The occurrence of anticardiolipin antibodies in the serum of blood in patients suffering from antiphospholipid syndrome is a better foretelling factor for the future pregnancy outcome than the occurrence of lupus anticoagulant antibodies.
