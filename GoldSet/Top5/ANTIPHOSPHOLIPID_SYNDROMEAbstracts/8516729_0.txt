Lupus anticoagulant activity and anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) were found in a six-year-old child with cerebral ischemic infarction in the absence of any underlying disease. The association of these antibodies with thrombosis has been well documented in adult patients. In view of our observation, we believe that aPL may also be involved in the pathogenesis of arterial thrombotic events in childhood, and aPL should be systematically searched in these cases.
