Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an auto-immune thrombophilia for which anti-thrombotic medication is necessary for long-term management to reduce thrombotic risk or pregnancy morbidity. Choosing the type of pharmacological treatment, i.e. the intensity and duration of anticoagulation, depends on the severity of an individual's APS and the risk of bleeding. This article reviews the current literature on anticoagulation therapy, provides recommendations on when to initiate therapy, and suggests possible alternatives for optimisation of management.
