The present study was designed to assess the impact of thymus ubiquitin complex (TUC) on morphological changes within the central nervous system (CNS) in pregnant rabbits with experimental antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). We also compared the intensity of neuropathological appearance and serological markers of the APS treated with the TUC. Post-mortem neuropathological investigations were done in 47 female New Zealand rabbits. The material was divided into 4 groups: Group I-23 pregnant animals with APS; Group II-7 pregnant rabbits with APS, treated with TUC; Group III-7 pregnant rabbits without APS, treated with TUC; Group IV (the control one)-110 pregnant animals without APS, untreated with TUC. The APS was induced by subcutaneous injections of cardiolipin. There were two main abnormalities within the CNS of pregnant rabbits, which could be a result of the APS: the thrombo-necrotic foci of nervous tissue, and perivascular or meningeal inflammatory infiltrates. It turned out that TUC application reduced the morphological abnormalities, but it did not eliminate them entirely. The number of cases with thrombo-necrotic changes was reduced by approximately 18%, while perivascular infiltrates by 36% respectively. The TUC application did not influence the meningeal infiltration. The platelet count significantly increased (p < 0.001), the activated partial thromboplastin time shortened (p < 0.001), and the number of immunised animals, demonstrating positive immunofluorescence test, significantly decreased after the TUC administration. The inflammatory changes within the CNS are the integral component of the experimental model of APS in pregnant rabbits. The TUC may decrease the inflammatory component of the APS in the CNS. The inflammatory infiltrates seem to be more responsive to TUC application and parallel to APS serological improvement after treatment than necrotic changes.
