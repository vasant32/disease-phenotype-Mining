A 27-year-old woman with anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, whose first pregnancy had ended in intrauterine fetal death, was treated with prednisolone 0.6 mg/kg/day before second pregnancy. Suppression of anti-cardiolipin antibody activity was rapidly achieved and maintained during the pregnancy. After conception, low-dose aspirin 81 mg/day was started and continued until delivery. She gave birth to a normal live infant with natural full-term delivery. It is strongly suggested that the corticosteroid and low-dose aspirin regimen can lead to successful pregnancy in cases with anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome like the present case.
