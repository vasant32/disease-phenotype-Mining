The antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with a large number of neurologic syndromes, cerebral infarct (CI) being the most common of them. In these cases the pathogenesis of the CI is poorly understood and remains controversial; however, the existence of a vasculopathy is indubitable. We report the cases of two young patients with CI and diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome who were submitted to cerebral angiograms, and one of them to necropsy. In one case the angiographic findings were similar to those of vasculitis in intracranial vessels. In the other case we observed obstruction in internal carotid artery at the angiography that looked like thrombosis in situ; at necropsy we found non-atherosclerotic obstruction in coronary arteries. In summary, is the primary lesion vasculitis, thrombosis, or both? These cases illustrate the discussion and demonstrate that vasculitic mechanisms may be involved in the vasculopathy of primary antiphospholipid syndrome even though thrombosis occur more frequently.
