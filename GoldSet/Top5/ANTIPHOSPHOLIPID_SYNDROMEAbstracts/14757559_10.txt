Consensus guidelines on anti-cardiolipin antibody (aCL) testing have been developed to help minimise laboratory variation in the performance and reporting of aCL assays. These guidelines include minimum, optimum and optional recommendations for the following aspects of aCL testing and reporting: (1) isotype of aCL tested; (2) specimen type; (3) controls and assay precision; (4) calibrators; (5) patient samples; (6) rheumatoid factors and IgM aCL testing; (7) reporting of results; (8) cut-off values; and (9) interpretative comments.
