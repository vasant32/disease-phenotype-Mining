A significant correlation between autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and premature or accelerated coronary atherosclerosis was found. The objectives of the study were: a) evaluate myocardial perfusion in patients with rheumatic diseases by means of contrast echocardiography (CE) and to establish its usefulness as compared to the results obtained by nuclear medicine (NM) (reference method). b) evaluate the prevalence of alterations in subclinical myocardial perfusion in autoimmune diseases and to establish a strategy to evaluate the cardiovascular changes in this disease. Myocardial perfusion in 37 outpatients of the rheumatology department was evaluated by CE at rest and with pharmacological stress (dobutamine) and NM. The prevalence of alterations in the myocardial perfusion in autoimmune diseases by CE and NM, when these methods were analyzed independently or when both methods were used was 27%. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of both tests was 80% and 93%, respectively, the sensitivity was 80% and the specificity was 93%. The prevalence of alterations of perfusion in the primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) was of 30%. In this patients it was found that when both diagnostic tests are performed, NM reaches a sensitivity of 100% if the CE is positive and an specificity of 100% when the CE is negative. We can conclude that it is important to determine the presence of subclinic coronary artery disease in patients with autoimmune disease by noninvasive studies such as Sestamibi SPECT and/or CE for assessment of myocardial perfusion in order to plan an adequate treatment and follow-up.
