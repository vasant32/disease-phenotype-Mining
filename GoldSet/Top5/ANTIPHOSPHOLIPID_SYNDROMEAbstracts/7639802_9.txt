OBJECTIVE: To investigate the origins of antiphospholipid antibodies associated with thrombosis and other disorders that are found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). METHODS: Characterization, idiotypic study, and nucleotide sequencing of a human monoclonal antiphospholipid antibody generated from a patient with primary APS. Identification of the germline genes from which the antibody is derived. RESULTS: A human monoclonal antibody, BH1, was generated. This antibody has ligand-binding properties that closely resemble those of the serum antiphospholipid antibodies found in our patient and in other individuals with APS: it recognizes negatively charged phospholipids, and has lupus anticoagulant activity; it does not bind to neutral phospholipids, or to single-stranded or double-stranded DNA. The relevance of BH1 to the patient's serum antibodies is supported by our idiotypic studies. BH1 is encoded by a new germline VH gene, and by a lambda light chain gene that displays > 99% homology with the V lambda III.1 germline gene. CONCLUSION: Serum antiphospholipid antibodies associated with thrombosis may be encoded by either germline or only slightly mutated variable-region genes.
