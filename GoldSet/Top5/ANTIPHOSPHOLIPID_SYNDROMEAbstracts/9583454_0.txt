We present the case of a 39-year-old woman with aortic regurgitation that may have been induced by primary antiphospholipid syndrome. The patient had suffered recurrent miscarriages, thrombocytopenia, and deep-vein thrombosis for the previous 16 years, and had been diagnosed as having primary antiphospholipid syndrome 9 years previously because of a high titer of anticardiolipin antibody. She had been receiving medication for moderate hypertension for 7 years. The patient was admitted to Tenri Hospital because of heart failure, which was thought to be caused by moderate aortic regurgitation, moderate hypertension, and mild chronic renal failure. Echocardiography revealed thickened aortic and mitral valves. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome might have induced valve regurgitation as a result of valvular thickening.
