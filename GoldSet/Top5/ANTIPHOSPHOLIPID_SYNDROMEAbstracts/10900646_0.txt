AIM: To evaluate effects of pregnancy on the course and prognosis of lupus nephritis and fetal outcome, in particular, in patients with lupus nephritis (LN) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of the course of LN in 31 females (44 pregnancies). RESULTS: A favorable outcome of pregnancy is possible in LN women if they had a persistent remission at conception. However, one third of these women had exacerbations of LN in pregnancy and early postpartum period. Pregnancy developing in active LN aggravated LN course in all the women. Fetal outcome was unfavorable. LN was especially severe if it arose in the course of pregnancy or early postpartum period. It seems that the presence of APS affected pregnancy outcome in a less degree than LN activity. CONCLUSION: Both in pregnancy and postpartum period, LN showed frequent exacerbations, but if the conception takes place during a persistent remission of LN, under adequate care and treatment, a delivery of a viable child is possible without an extraordinary risk for the mother.
