Antiphospholipid antibodies have been associated with pregnancy loss. We now present a possible association between antiphospholipid antibodies, recurrent spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies. L.M. is a 32-year-old woman, gravida 6, para 2023, whose obstetric history includes three spontaneous abortions and two infants with congenital anomalies including kidney atresia and oromandibular hypogenesis. The only normal offspring are twins born after receiving treatment of aspirin 80 mg daily during the pregnancy. Laboratory evaluation revealed the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. Antiphospholipid antibodies cause endothelial cell activation which has been proposed as a cause of congenital malformations. This case suggests the risk of not only recurrent spontaneous abortion but also congenital anomalies in the offspring of a women with antiphospholipid antibodies. The congenital anomalies are 'regional' and could result from embryonic vascular accidents as a result of antiphospholipid antibody interaction with endothelial cells. The only 'successful' pregnancy was with treatment with aspirin. If the associations illustrated in this obstetric history can be substantiated by population-based studies, it may be concluded that antiphospholipid antibodies are a risk factor for embryo teratogenicity as well as mortality.
