Background: Although clinically evident and MRI confirmed, basal ganglia involvement, is usual in primary antiphospholipid syndrome, extrapyramidal disorders such as parkinsonism and dystonia are very rare. We were unable to find any report in the literature on dystonia-parkinsonism in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Here we report an adult patient with dystonia-parkinsonism and primary antiphospholipid syndrome.Case report: A 60 year old, right-handed man came to our attention due to writer's cramp, bradykinesia and stiffness of his right hand. Neurological examination revealed constant, marked dystonic posturing, rigidity and bradykinesia of the right hand. Hyper-gammaglobulinemia was demonstrated on electrophoresis-serum IgG was increased. Anticardiolipin antibodies were examined by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (ELISA): IgG was negative, while IgM was positive. There was also slight thrombocytopenia. Magnetic resonance imaging brain scan axial T2W/UTSE revealed several hyperintense lesions in the basal ganglia and in the periventricular white matter and diffuse hyperintensity of the subcortical white matter bilaterally in the parietal regions. There was asymmetric parenchimal atrophy, more prominent in the left hemisphere. No clinical improvement was achieved by levodopa, dopamine agonists or anticholinergics. According to the criteria for primary antiphospholipid syndrome our patient had thrombocytopenia and high levels of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies so he was presumed to have a primary antiphospholipid syndrome.Conclusion: Various movement disorders may appear secondary to stroke, antiphospholipid syndrome, Behcet's disease or brain tumor. These cases may help in the understanding of pathophysiology of movement disorders. Dystonia and parkinsonism as well as other movement disorders may be associated with primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
