Two patients with positive antiphospholipid antibody and early multi-infarction dementia as a presenting feature of their illness are reported. One was included in the so called primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, while the second one met the criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus. We point out to the presence of aortic regurgitation in one of the patients and its possible relation with these antibodies. Although the precise mechanism of thrombosis is incompletely known, the recognition of this type of dementia is of paramount importance as it is a potentially treatable condition.
