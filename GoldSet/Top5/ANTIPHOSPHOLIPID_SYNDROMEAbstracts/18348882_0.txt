A patient experienced recurrent postural headache, transient visual obscurations, and papilledema. The patient initially presented with papilledema without cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (pseudotumor cerebri, idiopathic intracranial hypertension). One year later she had the similar symptoms and a recurrence of papilledema but now had obvious venous sinus thrombosis.
