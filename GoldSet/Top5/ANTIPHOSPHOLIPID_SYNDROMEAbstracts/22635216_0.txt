A single positive laboratory test among those exploring the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies is not associated with thromboembolic events and does not identify patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. On the other hand, more than one laboratory test positive, and in particular all three tests positive, is strongly associated to thromboembolic events and identifies high risk patients. Triple positivity is in fact related to the presence of a specific anti-Î²2-glycoprotein I (anti-Domain I) antibody, also able to prolong coagulation tests. Monoclonal antibodies against Domain I with Lupus Anticoagulant activity might be candidate material for standardization of antiphospholipid assays. Much work remains to be done in this field.
