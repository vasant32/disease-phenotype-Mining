 INTRODUCTION: The catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is a rare expression of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS). The all predicting factors of happening of CAPS are not yet discovered. Some women presenting an APLS with infertility have recourse to ovulation induction (OI). EXEGESIS: After an OI, a woman is admitted for acute renal failure, hypertension, seizures, respiratory failure. History and immunologic tests are in favour of APLS. Renal biopsy highlights a thrombotic microangiopathy. Diagnosis of CAPS is made. Patient improves after respiratory assistance, parenteral treatment for hypertension and anticoagulant therapy. CONCLUSION: IO seems to be on of the factors which leads to CAPS. To avoid such consequences, it's essential to know the history and the immunological status of the patients having recourse to this treatment to take care of these risked pregnancies.
