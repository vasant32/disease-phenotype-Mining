Inflammatory rheumatic diseases potentially involve organs and structures far beyond the musculoskeletal system including skin and blood vessels. A broad spectrum of neurologic, renal, pulmonary, hematologic and cardiac manifestations contributes to the complex clinical picture of connective tissue diseases and vasculitides. Regarding cardiac disease all structures of the heart may be involved. Pericarditis in lupus, mitral valve changes in the antiphospholipid syndrome, myocarditis and coronary artery stenosis in the systemic vasculitides are typical examples in systemic rheumatic diseases. Beyond this, pulmonary hypertension in systemic sclerosis or congenital heart block in newborns of lupus patients are further cardiac issues. Since better treatment options led to better long-term prognosis in connective tissue diseases, cardiovascular complications as a consequence of chronic disease- and therapy-related damage gain increasing attention.
