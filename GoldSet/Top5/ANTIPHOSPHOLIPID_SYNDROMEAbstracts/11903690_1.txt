We report the rare case of a 51-year-old man with asynchronous (heterochronic) bilateral renal infarction associated with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. He was treated for right renal infarction, but 2 months later, while under anticoagulant treatment, he had a recurrence on the other side of the renal infarction. The laboratory work-up confirmed antiphospholipid syndrome. Six months later the patient has not experienced any new thrombotic episodes and is receiving oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy.
