The objective of the investigation was to study the hemostatic system in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The study enrolled 72 subjects (26 patients with APS (mean age 45.5 +/- 10.2 years) and their 46 relatives, including 37 and 9 first- and- second-degree relatives, respectively; mean age 29.5 +/- 16.4 years) from 26 families. A battery of standardized tests was used to evaluate the hemostatic system. At the examination, most relatives were found to have signs of thrombophilia: activated intravascular coagulation and suppressed fibrinolysis. The high detection rate for lupus anticoagulant (LA) amongst the relatives of patients with APS (39.1%) is likely to suggest its heritability. Logistic regression analysis showed the prognostic value of thrombocytic aggregatory disorders in the development of hemorrhagic manifestations, as well as an association of LA and thrombocytopenia.
