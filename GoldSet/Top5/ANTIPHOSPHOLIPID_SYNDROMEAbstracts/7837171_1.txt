We describe an 18-year-old woman with primary antiphospholipid syndrome whose monozygotic twin sister is as yet an asymptomatic carrier of the lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI) antibodies. Serum concentrations of beta 2GPI were normal in the patient and elevated in her sister. HLA and complement C4 phenotypes showed the presence of class II antigens DR7 and DRw53 and of a C4AQ0 allele. This supports the theory that a genetic predisposition may influence the appearance of these autoantibodies.
