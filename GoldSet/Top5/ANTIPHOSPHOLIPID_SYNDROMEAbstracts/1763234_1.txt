The Authors report their favourable experience concerning the treatment of five cases of connective tissue diseases with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins: three cases of systemic lupus erythematosus with nephritis, hematological involvement and fever; one case of antiphospholipid antibody-associated pregnancy; and one case of juvenile dermatomyositis. Disease manifestations had proved refractory to previous conventional and sometimes aggressive therapies in all the patients. The results obtained are discussed on the basis of more recent data from the literature. Further investigation in the treatment of connective tissue diseases with intravenous immunoglobulins is suggested. However, this therapy should be employed only in carefully selected patients.
