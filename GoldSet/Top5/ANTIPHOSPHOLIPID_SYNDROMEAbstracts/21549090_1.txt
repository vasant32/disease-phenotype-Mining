Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), the most common lupus erythematosus (LE)-specific chronic manifestation of the skin, is often resistant to therapy. Atrophy, scarring, and pigmentation are often observed. In this study, we report two cases of DLE that were successfully treated with tocoretinate, a compound containing a mixture of retinoic acid and tocopherol. Atrophy and pigmentation improved in both cases. The mechanism of action of tocoretinate is discussed.
