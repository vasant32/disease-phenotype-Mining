Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), more common in females, manifests clinically as thrombosis and/or recurrent fetal loss. Hemolytic autoimmune anemia and neurological, cardiac and cutaneous manifestations are common. This is the case report of a male patient whose first manifestation of the disease was gangrene of the auricle. The diagnosis of APS was established by biopsy of the lower limb skin, which showed thrombotic vasculopathy with no evidence of vasculitis. This is one of the two major criteria, which, along with a minor criterion, establishes the diagnosis of APS. Possible differential diagnoses are discussed. The importance of the biopsy in the APS diagnosis of this male patient is emphasized.
