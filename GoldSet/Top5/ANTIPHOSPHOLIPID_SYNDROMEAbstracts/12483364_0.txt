Bilateral massive adrenal swelling (BAS) on computed tomography (CT) scan with no enhancement after injection of intravenous contrast media has been observed in two completely different clinical settings. On the one hand, BAS is the result of ischemic necrosis and subsequent hemorrhagic infarction in patients with sepsis and hypotension in critically ill situations. On the other hand, BAS is the result of microvascular thrombosis, ischemia, and secondary inflammatory swelling in the setting of thrombotic conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT), and thrombocythemia. In this study we present evidence that the etiology of unilateral or BAS in reported cases of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) is similar to the etiology of microvascular circulation disturbances in thrombocythemia caused by platelet-mediated inflammation and thrombosis in the peripheral, cerebral, and/or coronary endarterial microvascular circulation.
