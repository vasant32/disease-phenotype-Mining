 PROBLEM: In order to investigate the value of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies detection in screening autoimmune type recurrent spontaneous abortion and its clinic application in antiphospholipid syndrome diagnosis, we adopt repeat combined ACA and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies detection in this study. METHOD OF STUDY: Sera were collected from patients and work-up was done for detection of ACA and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The work-up was done for detection of antibodies once in every 6 weeks for 14 times consecutively. RESULTS: The repeated and combined detection of ACA and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies detection could raise the positivity rate up to 21.8% (P < 0.05) in comparison with positive for ACA alone (14.1%), positive for anti-beta2-GPI alone (3.1%), and concurrently positive for both ACA and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies (4.6%). In 91 confirmed positive antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) patients, with more frequent screening for ACA and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies, more patients with APA were found. The positive rate of five and more screenings was over 81.32%, which was statistically significant (P < 0.05), in comparison with that of four or less screenings (68.13%). CONCLUSION: Our data implied that it would be appropriate to take over five or more screenings of combined ACA and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies detection in suspect patients to facilitate the positive diagnostic rate for autoimmune type RSA.
