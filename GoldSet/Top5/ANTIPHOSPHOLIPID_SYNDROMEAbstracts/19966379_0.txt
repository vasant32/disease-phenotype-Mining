We present a young patient with myocardial infarction who had recurrent coronary thrombosis, in-stent thrombosis, and a major pulmonary arterial thromboembolism due to primary antiphospholipid syndrome. He also developed multiple intracerebral hematomas following anticoagulation therapy and thrombolysis. We describe this rare case of primary antiphospholipid syndrome presenting with varied arterial abnormalities along with hemorrhage and highlight the need for caution while treating them with anticoagulants and thrombolytics.
