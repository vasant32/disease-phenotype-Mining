We report on a 28-year old patient with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who presented with fever and laboratory markers of inflammation. Her medical history was relevant for multiple ovulation inductions (OI) and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). She had two miscarriages and one preterm delivery. Intracardiac thrombosis was diagnosed in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. We suggest that primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was possibly triggered by OI.
