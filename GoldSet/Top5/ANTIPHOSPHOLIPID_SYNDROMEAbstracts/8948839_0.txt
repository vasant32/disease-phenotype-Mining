Five patients with acral chilblains and lupus anticoagulant activity revealed by coagulation analysis are reported. Three patients suffered a systemic lupus erythematosus, and two of them a completely developed antiphospholipid syndrome as well. Another case had chronic cutaneous lupus with only facial discoid lesions, and in the last one the lupus anticoagulant was likely related to a chronic liver infection of hepatitis B virus because she had not erythematous lupus. There are few dermatologic references about chilblain associated to lupus anticoagulant. Certain evidences suggest a pathogenic relation of this findings.
