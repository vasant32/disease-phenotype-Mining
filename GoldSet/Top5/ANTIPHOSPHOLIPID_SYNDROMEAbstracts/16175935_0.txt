We report a case with epileptic seizures, cognitive dysfunction, livedo reticularis, renal microangiopathy, acute myocardial infarction and high titres of anticentromere antibodies (ACA) and IgG/IgM anticardiolipin antibodies. This is a rare association between primary antiphospholipid syndrome and ACA positivity that has not been reported so far in the literature.
