Introduction of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) has improved the standardization of laboratory control of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT). However, it has been reported that misleading INR results can be obtained from OAT patients with lupus anticoagulant (LA). To investigate this claim, we studied 35 OAT patients, 14 of whom had anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) with a documented LA. Attainment of anticoagulation was confirmed by chromogenic assay of factor VII and factor X. Prothrombin times were performed using eight thromboplastins (five derived from rabbit brain, two recombinant human tissue factor and one made from human placenta) with an International Sensitivity Index (ISI) of <1.40. When using the thromboplastin manufacturers' ISI there was a significant difference (ANOVA, P<0.0001) between INR results obtained with the eight reagents for both APS (average CV = 12.4%) and non-APS (average CV = 12.5%) patient groups. Variation using the eight thromboplastins was assessed by calculating the CV for each sample; these values were then pooled for each patient group to give the average CV for all samples with all reagents for the two patient groups. Results for both patient groups exhibited markedly reduced variation (APS group average CV = 6.5%, non-APS group average CV = 5.8%) when locally assigned ISI values were employed in the calculation of INRs. Our data does not support the suggestion that the INR may not reflect the true level of anticoagulation in the long-term warfarin-treated patient, in whom lupus anticoagulant was detected. However, there was strong evidence that thromboplastin use should be restricted to those clot detection systems for which the reagent's manufacturer has assigned an ISI, or local ISI assignment must be undertaken. The inappropriate use of a generic (i.e. optical or mechanical clot detection system without regard to specific analyser type) ISI value can lead to ambiguous results.
