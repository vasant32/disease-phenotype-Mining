Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were recently discovered to recognize a complex consisting of phospholipids and apolipoprotein H (apo H). In this study, we determined the serum apo H levels in 36 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with or without antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), including aCL and lupus anticoagulants, to clarify the possible effects of aPL on apo H levels in vivo. The apo H levels were low in SLE patients as compared with 22 healthy controls. However, no associations were found between apo H levels and circulating aPL or clinical features of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. A secondary hyperlipidemic state, which probably related to lupus nephritis (proteinuria) and/or prednisolone treatment, increased apo H levels in SLE patients.
