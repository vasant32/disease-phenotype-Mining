We report the case of a woman who, at the age of 27, developed a cerebral arterial occlusion. The laboratory investigations showed an anti-human beta2-glycoprotein I antibody, but no other biological sign of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or autoimmune disorders. The patient otherwise presented with diabetes and moderate obesity. The species specificity of anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies probably explains the discrepancy between false negative results for antiphospholipid antibodies assayed by clotting and ELISA studies and positivity for anti-human beta2-glycoprotein I. Further studies will be important to evaluate the frequency of such antibodies, as well as their value as a risk factor for venous and arterial thrombosis, and their signification within the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
