Unexpected elevation of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) in women with anti-phospholipid syndrome has already been described as a predictor of fetal death. In this report we present a case of a pregnant woman with elevated second trimester MSAFP, in which Doppler ultrasound at 28 weeks suggested very poor fetal prognosis. A cesarean section was performed, but 2 days later the infant died due to distress. The only remarkable feature at post-mortem study was the finding of four vessels in the umbilical cord. Conventional investigation of the mother led us to the diagnosis of a primary anti-phospholipid syndrome. The finding of such an association should alert clinicians to the increased risk of fetal death. Precocious Doppler ultrasound examination may be the elective non-invasive technique to monitor such high risk fetuses.
