We performed a retrospective study of all systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pregnancies during a two-year period (2006-2007) to describe the clinical features, maternal and foetal outcomes in our centre. There were 17 pregnancies in 16 women with SLE. Our patients have a mean age of 28.31 years (SD 5.24) and a mean disease duration of 38.62 months (SD 38.03). Our patients have complicated pregnancies: 35.3% have SLE flares, 21.1% have preeclampsia and 47.4% needed caesarean sections. There were 15.8% foetal losses and 12.5% preterm deliveries in our patients. All the foetal losses occurred in patients with severe SLE flares during pregnancies. Lupus pregnancies in our centre generally have a good maternal and foetal outcome comparable with developed countries. The low incidence of antiphospholipid syndrome, the high usage of hydroxychloroquine and the high SLE remission rate in our patients before conceptions are the possible factors contributing to the good outcome.
