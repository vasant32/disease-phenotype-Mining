Three cases of post-sinusoidal hepatic blood flow obstruction as the main feature of antiphospholipid syndrome are reported. Clinically, these patients developed jaundice, malaise, ascites and hepatomegaly. Ultrasonography-Doppler and hepatic venography showed small hepatic vein disease in two and partial occlusion in the suprahepatic segment of inferior vena cava in the remaining patient. In all, anticardiolipin antibodies were positive and activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged. This experience emphasizes that in patients with post sinusoidal portal hypertension, a systematic search for antiphospholipid syndrome must be carried out.
