Susac's syndrome is a microangiopathic disorder of unknown pathogenesis presenting with encephalopathy, hearing loss and branch retinal artery occlusions. The term 'catastrophic' antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is used to define a subset of the APS characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy with clinical evidence of three or more organ involvement developed in a short period of time. We describe a patient with typical features of Susac's syndrome, that appeared in less than a week, in whom aPL were detected, thus fulfilling criteria for 'probable' catastrophic APS.
