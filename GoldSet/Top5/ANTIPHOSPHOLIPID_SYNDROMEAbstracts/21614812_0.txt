The present work was intended to study the process of fibrin formation and lysis and plasmin generation in a group of patients with recurrent miscarriage (RM), due to the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (N = 10); as well as in women with RM without the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (N = 6), compared with those of a group of healthy women (N= 8). In the group of patients with APS, nine were positive for antibodies against cardiolipin (aCL), five for anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta2GPI), four for both antibodies, and one for antibodies against prothrombin (aPT) and lupus anticoagulant (LA). Fibrin formation and lysis was followed by turbidity and plasmin generation using chromogenic substrate S2251. The polymerization curves from RM patients without APS and the LA patient showed an increased slope and maximum turbidity compared to those of the control group. The speed of lysis was higher in the LA patient (21 +/- 0) 10(-4) deltaOD/seg and the RM patients without APS (19.6 +/- 5.7) 10(-4) deltaDO/seg, compared to that of the control group (14.5 +/- 2.8) 10(-4) deltaDO/seg. Plasmin generation increased only in RM patients without APS (85 +/- 24%) against the control group (52 +/- 3%), p = 0.005. The changes observed in the fibrin polymerization and lysis process of women with RM without APS and LA seem to be related to their higher fibrinogen levels, while the increased plasmin generation was related to the patients' morbidity.
