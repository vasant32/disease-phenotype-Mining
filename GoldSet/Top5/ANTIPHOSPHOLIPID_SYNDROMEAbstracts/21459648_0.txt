Thromboembolic events tend to arise during the natural lifetime of tumors. However, multiple thromboemboli mimicking catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is quite rare as a first manifestation of a tumor. Herein we describe the case of a 51-year old woman that presented with multiple thromboemboli affecting her brain, lung and kidneys. Despite bolus administration of corticosteroids, anticoagulant therapy and immunoglobulin infusion treatment, the patient died. She had suffered from two occult tumors, which could not be identified premortem: a lung adenocarcinoma and an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. This case underscores the importance of determining the underlying etiology behind multiple thromboemboli. The most important prognostic factor is rapid initiation of treatment of the multiple thromboemboli, emphasizing treatment of their etiology.
