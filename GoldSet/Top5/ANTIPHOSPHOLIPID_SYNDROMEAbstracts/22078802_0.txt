A wide variety of dermatologic manifestations has been described in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The most frequent skin lesion is livedo reticularis, present not only on the limbs but also on the trunk, with a fine irregular pattern. It belongs to the arterial subset of APS. Circumscribed ulcerations, resembling livedoid vasculitis, may be the first manifestation of APS. Ulcerations may also occur as a late complication of recurrent venous thrombosis. Extensive skin necrosis is a classic manifestation of catastrophic APS. Pseudo-vasculitis lesions are misdiagnosed if a skin biopsy is not performed, especially in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus. In systemic lupus erythematosus, primary anetoderma is always associated with antiphospholipid antibodies.
