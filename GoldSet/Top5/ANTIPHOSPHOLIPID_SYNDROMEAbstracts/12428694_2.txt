We treated three thrombophilia-complicated pregnant women (two antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, one protein C deficiency) with low molecular weight heparin (dalteparin). All three pregnancies including one twin pregnancy ended in live births without a decrease in bone mineral density. This treatment modality was effective and safe preventing thrombosis during their pregnancies.
