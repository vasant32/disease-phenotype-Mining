We report the case of a 50-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus who had previously undergone pacemaker implantation. She developed recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism and was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. During investigation, pacemaker endocarditis was discovered, and the system was surgically explanted. Surprisingly, all microbiological studies, including culture of the extracted material and extensive serological analysis, were negative and she remained well with anticoagulation plus her usual immunosuppressant regimen. The data indicate that her pacemaker endocarditis could be an equivalent of the nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis often described in native valves.
