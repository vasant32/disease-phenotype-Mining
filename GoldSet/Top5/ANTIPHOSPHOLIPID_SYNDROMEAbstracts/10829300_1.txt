We report a case of acute adrenal insufficiency in a context of probable bilateral adrenal haemorrhage, as revealed by CT-scan in a 52-year-old woman with a history of spontaneous abortion and repeated ischaemic stroke without symptoms or signs of collagen vascular disease. The symptoms began after the patient had successfully been treated for pneumonia. She had persistently high titres of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies, antibodies against beta 2-glycoprotein I and a lupus anticoagulant. The diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome with adrenal insufficiency was postulated.
