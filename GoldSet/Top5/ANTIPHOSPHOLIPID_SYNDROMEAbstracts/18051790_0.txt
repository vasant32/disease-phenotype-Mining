We reported a case of Sj√∂gren's syndrome with pulmonary involvement diagnosed by video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy. The patient was a 54-year-old woman with antiphospholipid syndrome. Her chest radiograph and CT scan showed multiple nodules with or within cystic lesions. The thoracoscopic lung biopsy specimens revealed nodular amyloid deposits associated with bronchiolitis. The mechanism of bulla formation appeared to be a check-valve mechanism caused by the narrowing of the airway due to bronchiolitis with mononuclear cell infiltration. She has no symptoms without respiratory failure or functional impairment, therefore we are following her closely without therapy.
