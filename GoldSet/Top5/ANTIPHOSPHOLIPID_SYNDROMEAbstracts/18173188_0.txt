Production of the antiphospholipid antibodies is usually associated with the development of antiphospholipid syndrome. The caracter of this syndrome is: venous and arterial thromboses, pregnancy loss, thrombocytopenia and some damages of blood-vessels. We have studies 150 pts with Systemic Lupus Erythematosis, 100 women with unknown for pregnancy loss and 36 pts with Sneddons Sy. Antikardiolipin antibodies were determined by the standard ELISA method, Lupus Anticoagulant by 4 phospholipid-depent coagulation test using the snake poison. The significant correlation (p<0,110) was found between antiphospholipid antibodies and development of antiphospholipid syndrome by the pts with autoimmune patology.
