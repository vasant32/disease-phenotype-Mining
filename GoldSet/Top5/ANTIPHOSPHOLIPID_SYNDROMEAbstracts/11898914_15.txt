The objective of this study was to assess the possible role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS). We studied 28 patients with SLE, 10 patients with PAPS, and 24 healthy controls. VEGF plasma levels were measured by ELISA. Immunolocalization of VEGF was done in renal tissue from SLE patients and cadaveric controls. Our results showed that VEGF plasma levels were increased in SLE patients compared with PAPS and controls. The correlation between clinical manifestations and VEGF levels revealed that SLE patients with renal failure had significantly increased plasma VEGF levels (134.1 + 91.0 pg/ml) compared with SLE patients with normal renal function (42.9 + 19.0 pg/ml), PAPS patients (41.9 + 26.6 pg/ml), and controls (36.2 + 27.0 pg/ml; P < 0.01). Immunostaining showed a strong expression of VEGF in SLE renal tissue samples. Our preliminary results indicate that VEGF is increased in plasma from patients with lupus nephritis and a moderate degree of renal failure and is overexpressed in renal tissue from these patients.
