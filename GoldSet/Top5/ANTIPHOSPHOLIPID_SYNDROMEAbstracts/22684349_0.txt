 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of main hereditary thrombophilias, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), and hyperhomocysteinemia in Brazilian children and adolescents diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) without associated hepatic disease. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out with 32 children with PVT in accompaniment at Hospital das Cl√≠nicas of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais from January 1990 to July 2011. Laboratory evaluation of thrombophilias was performed from September 2010 to July 2011. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were evaluated; 59% were boys. Median age at diagnosis was 2.4 years. Mean time of patients' accompaniment was between 4.7 and 5.2 years. The presence of hereditary and acquired thrombophilias occurred in 34.4% of patients, and 9 of them also showed other risk factors in the previous history evaluation. Risk factors were absent in the previous history of 18 patients (56.3%). Two patients showed persistent high titres of anticardiolipin antibodies. Hyperhomocysteinemia was not observed. One patient was heterozygous for factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation (3.1%). Eleven patients (34.4%) showed heterozygous methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, and no patient had the JAK2V617F mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Even after investigation of main hereditary and acquired thrombophilia, PVT remains without apparent cause in most patients. Nevertheless, association of local and systemic risk factors seems to be important also in the pediatric age group. Therefore, despite the low prevalence, a complete investigation, which includes both hereditary and acquired thrombophilias, may be necessary.
