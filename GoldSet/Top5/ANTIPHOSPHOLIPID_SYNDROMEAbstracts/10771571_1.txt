Recent reports have indicated that antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are related to other clinical manifestations such as cardiac valve lesions and hemolytic anemia besides the major clinical features of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), including thrombocytopenia, and recurrent fetal demise. We recently encountered a case of multiple hormonal deficiencies in the pituitary gland and hypothyroidism associated with an APS. Hypopituitarism of the patient had occurred after her delivery and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination disclosed "empty sella" of the hypophysis, so she was thought to have Sheehan's syndrome. There has been a few reports describing the relationship between aPL and endocrine disorders. aPL-related onset of these diseases may be more frequent than is generally appreciated.
