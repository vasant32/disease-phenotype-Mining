 INTRODUCTION: Among microangiopathic disorders of pregnancy, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is a maternal and fetal life-threatening disorder. Hepatic involvement of this multi-systemic disorder can be confused with HELLP syndrome, occurring usually later in the course of pregnancy. CASE REPORT: We report a case of probable CAPS with hepatic disease in a pregnant woman at 13 week's gestation, with antiphospholipid syndrome and biological features of HELLP syndrome. Unspecific hepatic imaging, well-described in our case allowed undelayed therapy. CONCLUSION: CAPS and HELLP syndrome, both severe microangiopathic disorders, may be associated. Nosological distinction does not modify treatment strategy, which is a maternal and foetal emergency, but their overlapping requires aggressive and early management.
