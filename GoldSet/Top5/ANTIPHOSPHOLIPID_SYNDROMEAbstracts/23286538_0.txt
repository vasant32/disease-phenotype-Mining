Introduction: Preparations of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are used as treatment in different diseases such primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, autoimmune diseases, systemic inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases and allergic diseases among others. Objective: to present 13 of our cases with the use of IVIG in different rheumatic diseases. Patients and methods: we retrospectively studied 13 patients (10 women and 3 men), mean age 29 years with different rheumatic diseases, that underwent conventional treatments without positive response. They received IVIG pulses, trying to improve or induce remission of their previous clinical situation. 6/13 patients met criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 2/13 had primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APL)one had polydermatomyositis (PDM), 1 juvenile arthritis, 1 panarteritis nodosa (cutaneous PAN), one Evans syndrome, and one with autoimmune uveitis. Results: 7 of them had a positive response to therapy with IGEV evaluated by clinical and biochemical parameters. They remained with conventional treatments. One patient received a new IG EV pulse after 24 months, because of panniculitis reactivation. Clinical and biochemical response was poor in 4 of them, and 2 patients died. Conclusion: IVIg may be usefull in autoimmune rheumatic diseases when conventional therapies have failed. The therapeutic success is also limited. Only the 55 percent of our patients had a positive clinical response. Key words: intravenous immunoglobulin, rheumatic diseases, therapeutic efficacy.
