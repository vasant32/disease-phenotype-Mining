We reported an autopsy case of cerebral infarction with primary lung cancer. The patient was a 50-year-old man. Despite having been treated with warfarin potassium and ticlopidine hydrochloride, he relapsed cerebral infarction. His laboratory data on admission showed that lupus anticoagulant was positive, together with a high value of beta-thromboglobulin, thrombin-antithrombin III complex, markers of platelet and coagulation activation, CEA and CA 19-9. The autopsy finding revealed a primary papillary adenocarcinoma in the right lower lung, multiple cerebral infarction, renal infarction, pulmonary infarction and splenic infarction. The atherosclerotic changes were mild in the whole tissues and findings of vasculitis were not observed. Recurrence of cerebral infarction was effectively suppressed with the addition of steroid therapy to antithrombotic therapy. This case was considered as catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. It is necessary to differentiate antiphospholipid syndrome in case of the abnormal coagulation and fibrinolytic factors with recurrent cerebral infarction. Moreover, systemic examinations are important, because malignant tumor may exist on the background of the case.
