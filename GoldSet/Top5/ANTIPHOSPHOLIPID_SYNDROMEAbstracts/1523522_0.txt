Anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is characterized by thrombocytopenia, thrombosis and/or abortion. Steroid and aspirin therapy has been reported useful for habitual abortion associated with APS. Eleven patients, whose prior pregnancies resulted in habitual abortion (41 abortions), were received a intentional prednisolone (40 mg/day) and aspirin (81 mg/day) therapy before further pregnancies and both agents were decreased gradually. We maintained prednisolone (10-15 mg/day) and aspirin (40.5 mg/day) during pregnancy period. After the treatment, the outcome of pregnancy was successful in 7 of 10 pregnancies. The weight of newborn infants ranged from 1980 to 2980 g and apgar score ranged from 4 to 9 points. No side effect was observed, and fetal malformation and/or adrenal insufficiency was not recognized in any infants. In conclusion, an intentional prednisolone plus aspirin therapy is useful to prevent habitual abortion in patient with APS.
