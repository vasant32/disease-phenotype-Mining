Authors report the case of a pregnant woman with antiphospholipid syndrome associated with HELLP syndrome. Pregnancy was terminated because of severe preeclampsia. However the patient's condition worsened. New symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome developed (deep vein thrombosis, ischaemic optic lesion) and ARDS, therefore respiratory therapy was introduced. Plasmaphereses were performed concomitantly with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, glucocorticoid, cyclophosphamide and anticoagulant therapy. She responded to the therapy well, and eventually recovered completely. There are only a few case reports about pregnancies complicated with the association of antiphospholipid syndrome and HELLP syndrome. To authors' best knowledge, this is the first Hungarian report about this rare and curious association and it's successful treatment.
