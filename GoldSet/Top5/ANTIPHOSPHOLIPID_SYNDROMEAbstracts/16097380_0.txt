INTRODUCTION: The possibility of nicotine toxicity, although rare, should be considered in cases of acute edematous pancreatitis. CASE: A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized to identify the cause of an initial episode of acute edematous pancreatitis. The observation of native anti-DNA and antiphospholipid antibodies suggested lupus pancreatitis and/or an antiphospholipid syndrome, both subsequently ruled out. The final diagnosis was nicotine poisoning induced by the combination of a nicotine patch and tobacco smoking. CONCLUSION: Although a nicotine patch has never been reported in connection with an episode of acute pancreatitis before, this case suggests that such an event might be a rare complication of an overdose of nicotine.
