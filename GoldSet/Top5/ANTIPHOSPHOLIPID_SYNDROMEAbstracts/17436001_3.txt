We are reporting a case of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) in an adult female manifested with severe hypertension followed by adrenal haemorrhagic infarction and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Adrenal involvement appears to be exceedingly high in CAPS and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the prevailing pulmonary manifestation in this condition, compared with these impediments in patients with simple antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Even though the above manifestations are well recognized, their combination as an initial presentation of CAPS is uncommon.
