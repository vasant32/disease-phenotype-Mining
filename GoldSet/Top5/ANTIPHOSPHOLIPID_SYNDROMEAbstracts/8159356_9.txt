 BACKGROUND: The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome has been associated with thromboembolic events, thrombocytopenia, fetal death, fetal growth retardation, and early-onset severe preeclampsia. CASE: A postpartum woman developed fever, pulmonary infiltrates, cardiac conduction defects, and renal insufficiency following severe preeclampsia. She tested positive for lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody, and responded to steroid therapy and plasmapheresis. CONCLUSION: The postpartum multi-system involvement suggests that a variety of clinical presentations may be associated with antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment with plasmapheresis or corticosteroids may be of value in similar cases.
