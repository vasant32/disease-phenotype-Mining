We report two patients with contrasting patterns of retinal vascular occlusion associated with the primary anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. The immuno-pathological features and clinical associations are discussed. This condition is of interest to ophthalmologists because of its association with thrombosis in the eye, brain and elsewhere and because it provides new insights into the pathogenesis of retinal vascular disease in young patients.
