We describe a technique by which a gum elastic bougie (GEB) is used to facilitate an anticipated difficult endotracheal intubation in a patient undergoing rigid bronchoscopy. After placing the GEB through the lumen of the rigid bronchoscope, the GEB-suction catheter assembly was used to safely withdraw the bronchoscope in a manner mimicking the withdrawal of an intubating laryngeal mask airway (LMA) over the endotracheal tube using a stabilizer rod. The rationale for management and potential advantages of this approach versus use of an airway exchange catheter (including increased stability of an intubation guide) are discussed. IMPLICATIONS: We describe a technique of using a gum elastic bougie to facilitate an endotracheal intubation in a patient undergoing rigid bronchoscopy, which can be useful in a variety of clinical situations when the rigid bronchoscope is used in patients with abnormal airway.
