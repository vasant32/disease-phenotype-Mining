Since thrombomodulin (TM) is a specific cell surface glycoprotein for vascular endothelial cells, serum TM (s-TM) might be a useful marker of endothelial cell damage. Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) frequently detected in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been associated with vascular occlusive diseases. Therefore we measured the s-TM in 60 patients with SLE, in 23 patients with other diseases including aPL (disease control group) and in 26 healthy subjects, by means of an enzyme immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies to human TM. A significant positive correlation was found between s-TM and serum creatinine levels in SLE patients (r = 0.813, p less than 0.001). When the s-TM level was divided by the serum creatinine level (TM/Cr) to exclude the effect of renal clearance, the TM/Cr ratios were significantly increased in SLE patients with active lupus nephritis (LN) compared to those without LN (p less than 0.05). The ratios did not correlate with the presence of aPL or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS) in SLE patients or in the disease control group, although a weak correlation between the TM/Cr ratios and IgG-anticardiolipin antibody titers was found in the SLE patients without LN (r = 0.449, p less than 0.01). The present results suggest that elevated TM/Cr ratios reflect renal and possibly extra-renal endothelial cell damage in SLE patients with active LN, but that s-TM levels do not associate with the presence of aPL or a history of APLS.
