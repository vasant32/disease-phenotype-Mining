OBJECTIVE: A descriptive study was conducted on patients with uveitis to determine the frequency of associated autoimmune systemic diseases. METHODS: 64 patients with uveitis were studied. The patients were not known to have an underlying autoimmune systemic disease prior to the diagnosis of uveitis. All patients had the following immunological tests performed: serum immunoglobulins, complement components, circulating immune complexes (CIC), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-cardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and major histocompatibilty complex antigens. RESULTS: A relationship with a sub-clinical autoimmune systemic disorder could be presumed in eleven cases (17.2%). This was defined by positive autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA or ACA) in the presence of complement consumption, hyper-gammaglobulinemia or increased CIC without clinical criteria of a defined autoimmune disease. A definite association with systemic autoimmune disease was defined in four patients (6.25%). The observed autoimmune systemic diseases were Sj√∂gren's syndrome (n=2, 3.13%), anti-phospholipid syndrome associated with lupus-like disease (n=1, 1.6%), and systemic vasculitis (n=1, 1.6%). Lupus-like disease (n=4, 6.25%) was also observed. CONCLUSION: In a significant proportion of patients with uveitis an autoimmune systemic disorder may be present and should be looked for.
