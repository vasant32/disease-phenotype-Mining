Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) have been reported to occur in several conditions other than antiphospholipid syndrome, including infections. We herein report the case of a 21-year-old Japanese woman with Parvovirus B19 infection, who developed multiple pulmonary emboli associated with aPL, a lupus anticoagulant and IgM anticardiolipin antibody. Eight weeks later, antiphospholipid antibodies spontaneously disappeared and normal pulmonary flow was observed. Considering the high prevalence of Parvovirus B19 infection, we should be aware of thrombosis associated with transient aPL antibodies in this infectious disease.
