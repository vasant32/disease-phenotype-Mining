Antiphospholipid syndrome is a rare clinical entity that manifests through repeated thrombotic events in young patients without cardiovascular risk factors. The most frequent clinical features are repeated fetal losses and acute cerebral ischemic events. Cardiac involvement is less frequent. We present the case of a calcified thrombus in the right ventricle with extension to the pulmonary artery in a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent miscarriage who was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome.
