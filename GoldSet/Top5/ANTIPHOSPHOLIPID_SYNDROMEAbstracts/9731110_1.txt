We compared the sensitivity and specificity of a tissue factor-based assay (FVR) with the addition of a phospholipid/silica preparation, to the commercially available aPTT-based method, APCR (CoatestTM), and a modified aPTT-based method (APCM) which utilized factor V-depleted plasma, for the detection of the factor V Leiden mutation. A total of 110 patients were included in this study. This included 32 patients on coumadin therapy, 7 patients on heparin therapy, 5 patients on both anticoagulants therapy, and 24 patients who were positive for anticardiolipin antibody (ACL) and/or lupus inhibitor (LI). Our data demonstrate that the FVR is not affected by anticoagulation treatment or ACL/LI antibodies, whereas in the APCR method, 33 patients cannot be determined either due to the anticoagulant therapy or presence of the ACL and/or LI. With the APCM method, the clotting endpoint could not be determined in 1 patient due to the presence of a strong LI. The additional phospholipid/silica material utilized in the FVR enhanced the APC degradation of factor Va and therefore sharpened the demarcation between the factor V Leiden-positive and -negative patients. The sensitivity for the APCR, APCM and FVR was 42, 97 and 100% respectively. The specificity for the APCR, APCM and FVR was 94, 96 and 100% respectively.
