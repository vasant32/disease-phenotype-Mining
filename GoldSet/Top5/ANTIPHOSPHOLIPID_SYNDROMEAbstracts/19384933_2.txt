Lupus anticoagulants (LA) are acquired autoantibodies that can cause antiphospholipid syndrome. LAs prolong phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests, acting as nonspecific inhibitors that are neutralized in the presence of excess phospholipid. However, there is no gold standard test and the testing is influenced by a number of variables. This article summarizes laboratory testing for LAs, with particular focus on technical issues and limitations of testing. Am. J. Hematol. 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
