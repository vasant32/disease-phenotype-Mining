A 52-year old woman admitted to our hospital because of productive cough and dyspnea. Breathing room air arterial blood gases, revealed severe hypoxemia (P/F ratio 185 mmHg) and Chest CT showed diffuse ground glass opacities in both lung fields. Respiratory failure gradually improved after steroid pulse therapy, sivelestat sodium hydrate and antibiotics. However, a mosaic pattern attenuation in the lung parenchyma on Chest CT remained and ultrasonic cardiography showed dilation of right ventricle. Since the presence of V/Q mismatch in pulmonary perfusion and ventilation scintigrams and lupus anticoagulant were detected, we finally diagnosed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Therefore, this case reminded us that PTE and APS could cause ARDS.
