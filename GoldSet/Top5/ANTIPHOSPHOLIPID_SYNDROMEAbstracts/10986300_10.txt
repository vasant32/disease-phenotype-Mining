OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I (anti-beta(2)GPI) antibodies are associated with lupus nephritis (group II patients), and whether there are differences in the prevalence of these two autoantibodies between group II patients and patients with non-nephritis SLE (group I) and primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) patients (group III). METHODS: IgG and IgM aCL were measured in 31 patients and anti-beta(2)GPI in 30 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) nephritis and 25 without SLE nephritis and in 36 PAPS patients by validated enzyme immunoassays. Relationships of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies and antibodies to the collagenous region of C1q (anti-C1q) with SLE nephritis were also examined. RESULTS: The prevalence and levels were higher for aCL, but not for anti-beta(2)GPI, antibodies in group II than in group I patients. Absolute values of aCL and anti-beta(2)GPI in all three patient groups correlated with each other. The prevalences of aCL, anti-dsDNA and anti-C1q antibodies were significantly higher in group II than in group I and group III patients. CONCLUSION: The observations in this paper suggest that raised levels of aCL antibodies are associated with lupus nephritis. We were not able to demonstrate an association between anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies and kidney disease either in patients with lupus or in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. In SLE, we demonstrated that the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies in conjunction with elevated levels of anti-dsDNA and anti-C1q antibodies is highly specific for glomerulonephritis in patients with lupus.
