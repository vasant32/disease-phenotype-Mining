The registry is an European, multicentre, prospective and longitudinal study which follows a cohort of children born to mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). In this article we report preliminary results obtained from 138 mothers and 141 babies (three twin pregnancies). At birth, 16.3% of neonates were less than 37 weeks of gestation and 17% were low birth weight; in addition, 11.3% of neonates were small for gestational age. No cases of neonatal thrombosis were observed. During follow-up period five children showed behavioral abnormalities. A long term clinical follow-up will be necessary to evaluate the neuropsychological development of these children.
