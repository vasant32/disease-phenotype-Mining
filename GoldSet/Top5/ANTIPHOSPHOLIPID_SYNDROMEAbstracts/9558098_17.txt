Beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) is an absolute requirement for the binding of autoimmune anticardiolipin Abs (aCL) to cardiolipin (CL). We evaluated the target recognition of human beta2GPI by IgG derived from two patients with primary and two with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. The total IgG serum fractions and beta2GPI affinity-purified IgGs were assessed by using various domain-deleted mutants (DM) of human beta2GPI (DMs: I-III, I-IV, II-V, III-V, IV-V, and V) and mouse mAbs against individual beta2GPI domains. The four IgGs bound slightly to CL in the absence of beta2GPI and showed increased binding in the beta2GPI presence. Following affinity purification of the IgGs on a beta2GPI column, reactivity toward CL was absent. DMs containing domain V inhibited the binding of biotinylated beta2GPI to CL. The addition to CL-coated plates of DM V, but not the other DMs, reduced the binding of all four IgGs. The anti-beta2GPI IgGs bound only to complete beta2GPI and DM I-IV coated on the plates. The binding to plate-adsorbed beta2GPI could be inhibited by complete beta2GPI and DM I-IV, the latter being a more efficient inhibitor. Further, the human anti-beta2GPI IgGs could compete with the binding to beta2GPI of Cof-21 mouse mAb (directed at domain IV), but not with the two other mouse mAbs. The results suggest that some "autoimmune:" beta2GPI-dependent anticardiolipin Abs recognize a beta2GPI target that is distinct from the CL-binding site in domain V. The target site for some antiphospholipid syndrome IgGs appear to reside in domain IV of beta2GPI.
