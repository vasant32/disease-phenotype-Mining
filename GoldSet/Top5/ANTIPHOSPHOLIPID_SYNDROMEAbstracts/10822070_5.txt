Antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs) are considered risk factors in patients with thromboembolic diseases. Although the incidence of such acquired coagulation disturbances in adults are well described, only few data exist for children. Therefore, in a first step to collect new data we analyzed the presence of different APAs in 202 consecutive children and compared them with two groups of adults. The children screened for APA were exclusively those who did not have any thromboembolic complications or a tendency for thrombophilia due to other underlying diseases such as systemic lupus or malignancy in their past or present medical history. Consecutive blood samples were evaluated from routine laboratory specimens. The two groups of adults comprised 200 patients after deep vein thrombosis and 200 patients without thromboembolic events that served as controls. Four lupus anticoagulant (LA) screening tests were determined: the dilute Russell's viper venom test; a lupus anticoagulant-sensitive activated partial thromboplastin time reagent; a second lupus-sensitive activated partial thromboplastin time; and the Kaolin clotting time. Furthermore, three different antiphospholipid antibodies ELISA assays against cardiolipin (ACA), beta2-glycoprotein I, and phosphatidyl-serine, were determined. The children had a much higher prevalence for LA than did the adults. On the other hand, their values for ACA were significantly lower than in adults with a history of thromboembolism. Findings in children were similar to the normal adult group. This has to be taken into account when evaluating children with thromboembolic diseases.
