Purpura Fulminans and DIC were the main clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome observed in a 62-year-old man. The patient was well until 44 years of age when he began to suffer from recurrent thrombophlebitis, without other symptoms suggestive of immune disease. At the time of hospital admission the pt. appeared acutely ill, showing high fever, severe anemia, massive urinary blood loss, multiple purpuric patches evolving to hemorrhagic bullae and gangrene rapidly spreading over about 30% of the total body area. No signs of neurological involvement or of visceral thrombotic occlusions were present. Clotting tests were consistent with a diagnosis of DIC, further confirmed by skin biopsy showing the presence of thrombi in dermal arterioles. The autoantibody research was positive as follows: Waaler-Rose 1:40, Anti-DNA 1:80; ANF 1:640, aCA IgG 100 GPL. LA was diagnosed according to standard criteria: prolonged KCT and RVVT not corrected by a mixture of normal plasma and abnormal TTI. Plasma exchange in association with heparin and prednisone was effective in arresting the progression of the skin lesion; nevertheless the patient died ten days after hospital admission for sepsi and acute renal failure.
