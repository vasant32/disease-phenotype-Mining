 OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have identified hyperhomocysteinemia as a risk factor for both recurrent pregnancy loss and thrombosis. Antiphospholipid syndrome, an autoimmune disorder, is also characterized by recurrent pregnancy loss and thrombosis. Thus, our purpose was to determine if hyperhomocysteinemia is more common in patients with APS than normal fertile controls. METHODS: Plasma, sera and whole blood were obtained from two groups of women: (1) 22 with well-characterized antiphospholipid syndrome; and (2) 41 healthy fertile controls. Levels of fasting homocysteine, vitamin B16, vitamin B12, folate and the incidence of the C677/T mutation of the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase genotype (C677T/MTHFR) were determined. RESULTS: The proportion of individuals with hyperhomocysteinemia and fasting plasma homocysteine levels were similar in women with APS and controls. Levels of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folate and the incidence of C677/MTHFR were also similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Hyperhomocyteinemia and the C677T/MTHFR mutation are not common in women with antiphospholipid syndrome. Abnormal homocysteine metabolism is unlikely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of antiphospholipid syndrome.
