The aim of the study is to evaluate the frequency of chorea in a cohort of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) patients and their possible clinical and laboratory associations. The records of 88 PAPS patients, fulfilling Sapporo criteria, followed up at the rheumatology outpatient clinic, were analyzed in order to determine the frequency of chorea. Risk factors for chorea, clinical manifestations, associated comorbidities, serologic features and treatment strategies were analyzed. Eighty-eight PAPS patients were evaluated. Mean age was 40.6 Â± 11.1 years, and 91% of them were Caucasian and 91% women. Four (4.5%) patients with chorea were identified: 2 of them (50%) had only one chorea episode and 2 (50%) had recurrent chorea. All patients had chorea onset before PAPS diagnosis. Mean age, gender and ethnical distribution were comparable in groups with or without seizures (P > 0.05). Interestingly, the comparison of the 4 PAPS patients with chorea with those without this abnormality (n = 84) demonstrated a lower BMI [21.1 (18-24.2) vs. 27.5 (17.5-40.9) kg/m(2), P = 0.049] and frequency of venous events (0 vs. 63.1%, P = 0.023) in the first group. A higher frequency of rheumatic fever (75% vs. 0, P < 0.001) and thrombocytopenia (75 vs. 21.4%, P = 0.041) was observed in PAPS individuals with chorea. Both groups were alike regarding the other clinical APS manifestations, disease duration, risk factors for cerebrovascular diseases, use of drugs and antiphospholipid antibodies (P > 0.05). This study demonstrated that 4.5% of PAPS patients had chorea, predominately before PAPS diagnosis, and this neurological abnormality was associated with rheumatic fever and thrombocytopenia. These data reinforce the need for RF diagnosis in those PAPS patients with chorea.
