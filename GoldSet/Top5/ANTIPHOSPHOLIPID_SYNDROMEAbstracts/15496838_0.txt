Homeostatic examination of the blood was made with conventional methods in 115 patients with acute and chronic neurosensory hypoacusis. Statistically significant changes of hemostasis, blood rheology and lipid spectrum were detected. Causes of acute and chronic progressive neurosensory hypoacusis in some patients are discussed. The above changes should be taken into account when planning medication.
