A 39-year-old woman with the diagnosis of mitral regurgitation was admitted to our hospital for surgical treatment. Cerebral thromboembolism and spontaneous abortion had been repeated in her past history. She was suffered from chronic renal failure associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS). An operative procedure was recommended because of the progressive heart failure due to mitral regurgitation. For renal failure, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was introduced at one month before operation. As the operative procedure, valve replacement using Carpentier-Edwards bioprosthesis (27 mm) was done rather than valve reconstruction, because chordal rupture of posterior leaflet and severe hypertrophy of both leaflets were recognized. During operation, uncontrollable bleeding was not observed. However, platelet transfusion was needed. We use warfarin and antiplatelet agents jointly as postoperative anticoagulant therapy. Thromboembolic episodes have not been observed 4 years postoperatively. Relationship between SLE with APS and cardiac valvular lesions has been focused. The present case was considered to be the interesting case which various devices were necessary to operative management including chronic renal failure, cardiopulmonary bypass, selection of prosthetic heart valve, and postoperative anticoagulant therapy for preventing thrombus formation.
