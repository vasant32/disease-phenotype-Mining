 BACKGROUND: The aim of the study is to analyze retrospectively the effect of low-dose methylprednisolone (MP) and cyclophosphamide (CYC) pulse therapy on anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) serum levels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: For aCL determinations, a beta2-glycoprotein I-dependent enzyme-linked immunosorbent test (ELISA) was performed. Lupus anticoagulant was investigated by Russell venom time with platelet neutralization. Antinuclear antibodies were performed by standardized methods. All SLE patients (from a total of 137) with aCL determinations who were assayed before and after MP and CYC pulse therapy were included in the study. RESULTS: Nine patients had aCL determinations before and after MP-CYC pulse therapy. All active patients with SLE improved clinically without severe MP-CYC side effects; 21 had IgG-aCL determinations, and 19 IgM-aCL determinations (40 assays) were performed in all nine patients during the observation period (zero time to 21 months). Three patients had secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS)-related clinical manifestations. In all patients, IgG aCL antibodies decreased significantly (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Decrease of IgG aCL serum levels as a consequence of the MP-CYC therapy herein reported might help to redefine previous concepts with regard to modulation of antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) immune response by immunosuppressive therapy. These findings might also have prognostic and therapeutic implications in SLE, on pregnancy in SLE, and in antiphospholipid syndrome (APL) as well, although prospective studies are required.
