Chronic inflammatory rheumatological conditions are associated with an increased burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) most excess mortality is cardiovascular. Increased CVD risk is also associated with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic sclerosis. Several studies report that CVD mortality increases early in disease in RA, with increased risk of MI within one year and increased risk of hospital admission for CVD within seven years of diagnosis. A linear association has been demonstrated between subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and raised inflammatory markers. SLE is associated with 2-10 times the risk of a CVD event compared with the general population. CVD is now a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in SLE. Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, as well as thromboses. Atherogenesis in the context of autoimmune disease results from a complex interplay between traditional risk factors, disease-specific factors and drug-related adverse effects. Chronic inflammation itself modifies the lipid profile.
