Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), who are predisposed to vascular thrombotic events, are at additional risk for thrombosis when they undergo surgery. Serious perioperative complications (recurrent thrombosis, catastrophic exacerbation, or bleeding) occur despite prophylaxis. We describe our perioperative experience with APS patients who underwent a variety of surgeries, review the literature, and discuss strategies that may guide other physicians in their perioperative evaluation and management of patients with APS. Recommendations: perioperative strategies should be clearly identified before surgical procedure; pharmacological and physical antithrombosis interventions vigorously employed; periods without anticoagulation kept to a minimum; and any deviation from a normal course should be considered a potential disease related event.
