Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome is a toxicoderma with systemic involvement. Suspicion of this disorder obliges rapid withdrawal of the suspected drug, which may have been introduced up to 3 months earlier. Screening for human herpesvirus (HHV) 6 reactivation is important both for its diagnostic value and for its association with a poor prognosis. Reactivation of this virus is not a contraindication for systemic corticosteroid treatment, which should be tapered slowly in order to avoid recurrence. The possible appearance of antiphospholipid antibodies must also be considered in those cases associated with thrombocytopenia, altered hemostasis, or thrombotic events. Autoimmune disorders may also develop as a sequela of the condition. Medium-to-long-term follow-up is required even after complete resolution of the condition. We describe a new case of sulfasalazine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome associated with HHV-6 reactivation and the induction of anticardiolipin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies.
