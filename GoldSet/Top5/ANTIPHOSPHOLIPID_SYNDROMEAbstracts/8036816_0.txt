A case of the primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) in a 21-year-old Jamaican female is described. Recurrent abortions, thrombocytopenia and neurological complications as well as lupus anticoagulant positivity in the absence of features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were the main clinical findings. Diagnostic criteria, treatment and prognosis are discussed. When the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is present in the primary form, the diagnosis may be difficult but its recognition may prevent those vascular events which can lead to significant morbidity and foetal wastage.
