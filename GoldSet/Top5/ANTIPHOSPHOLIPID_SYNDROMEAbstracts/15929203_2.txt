During a period of 4 years, 21 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic disease (IAHD) and 42 healthy, sex- and age-matched subjects, were tested for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APA). At diagnosis, APA were detected in 10/21 (47.6%) patients and in 2/42 (4.76%) controls (p< 0.01). No thromboembolic events were registered during the follow-up period.
