A 41-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus anticoagulant developed aortic thrombosis. The patient was receiving low dose aspirin. Aortography showed a complete obliteration of the infrarenal aorta. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed no evidence of aortitis. The patient improved with medical treatment. Six other published cases are reviewed.
