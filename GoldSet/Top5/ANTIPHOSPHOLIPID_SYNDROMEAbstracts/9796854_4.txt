Severe pulmonary hypertension (PHT) occurring in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is uncommon. Different modalities have been tried in the treatment for this condition but have not been effective because of progressive increase of pulmonary resistance over time. Our patient with SLE and PHT with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a condition which has previously never been described, responded rapidly to combination treatment with immunosuppression, anticoagulation and vasodilator therapy.
