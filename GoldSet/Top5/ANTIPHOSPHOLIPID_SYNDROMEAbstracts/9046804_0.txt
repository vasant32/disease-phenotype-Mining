Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome manifesting as neurological symptoms (one patient with twice repeated cerebral ischemic symptoms in the left parietal and frontal lobes, and the other patient with cerebral infarction of the right temporal lobe) and non-neurological symptoms (one patient with occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery and the other patient with thrombophlebitis) underwent cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies using xenon-enhanced computed tomography. The patients with neurological symptoms had decreased CBF at the affected sites. The patients with non-neurological symptoms had decreased CBF in the left parietal and temporal lobes and/or corona radiata. Subtle preclinical thrombosis may cause chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
