 OBJECTIVES: Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic complications. There are limited data regarding the outcome of patients with APS who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Accordingly, we aimed to assess the long-term outcomes of these patients. METHODS: Nineteen APS patients who underwent PCI between the years 2003 and 2008 were compared to 380 patients who had undergone PCI during the same period (PCI group) and were matched by age (Â±5 years), gender, diabetes and hypertension. In addition, APS patients were compared to 1,458 patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) who were treated with PCI during the same period. Six-month to 4-year clinical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: The indication for PCI in the APS group was acute coronary syndrome in 52.6% of patients. After 1 year of follow-up, patients with APS had higher rates of target vessel revascularization than the other two groups, which translated to higher rates of major adverse cardiac events. There were no differences in MI or mortality rates between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with APS who undergo PCI have worse long-term clinical outcomes, driven by higher rates of revascularization, than other patients undergoing PCI. Further study is warranted to examine the mechanisms underlying these findings.
