Stroke, which is unusual in young adults, has been linked to recreational drug use and the antiphospholipid syndrome (aPS). Cocaine use has been related to stroke in this population, and aPS is a known cause of thrombotic neurologic events. We report a patient with positive lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies as well as a history of cocaine use immediately preceding the acute onset of multiple neurologic deficits. The findings in this case suggest a relationship between the use of cocaine, the aPS, and stroke in young adults.
