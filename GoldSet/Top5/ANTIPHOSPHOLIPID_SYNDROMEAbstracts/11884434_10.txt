Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces Abs against a vast array of mycobacterial lipids and glycolipids. One of the most prominent lipid Ags recognized is cardiolipin (CL). The kinetics of the generation of anti-CL Abs during infection reveals that IgM titers to CL increase over time. Interestingly, at day 30 postinfection CL-specific IgG1 appears, an isotype usually dependent on T cell help. Using an immunization schedule with CL/anti-CL Ab complexes, which induces antiphospholipid syndrome in mice, we show that the generation of IgG1 to CL requires IL-4 and that optimal production is T cell dependent. IgG1 production to CL was impaired in nude (nu/nu) mice devoid in conventional T cells, but was not affected in mice deficient for either alphabeta TCR(+), gammadelta TCR(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), or NK1.1(+) T cells. We conclude that IgG1 production to CL depends on T cell help and IL-4, which can be provided by different T cell populations. This is the first report that IL-4 is indispensable for the induction of IgG1 Abs to lipid Ags.
