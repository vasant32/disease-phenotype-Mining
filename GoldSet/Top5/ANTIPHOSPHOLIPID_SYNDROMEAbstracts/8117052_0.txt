Cardiac manifestations of phospholipid antibody syndrome may include mitral and/or aortic valve disease, pseudo-infectious endocarditis, thrombi of the right atrium, myocardial infection, pulmonary artery hypertension and cardiomyopathy with global or segmental left ventricular dysfunction. The authors report two patients showing evidence simultaneously of a circulating anticoagulant, dissociated syphilis serology and cardiolipin antibodies at a very high level. They had the majority of cardiac complications described in phospholipid antibody syndrome. Both also had renal involvement and one of them had recurrent venous thromboses and a cerebrovascular accident. Prolonged corticosteroid treatment, combined with anticoagulants in one patient, was accompanied by stability of lesions with follow-up of five years and ten months respectively.
