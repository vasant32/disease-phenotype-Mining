Although cardiac valve disease is frequent in the antiphospholipid syndrome, isolated tricuspid valve pathology is uncommon and tricuspid valve steno-insufficiency with concomitant vegetations in association with primary antiphospholipid syndrome has very rarely been mentioned in the literature. We describe a 54-year-old Indian woman with newly-diagnosed antiphospholipid syndrome and isolated tricuspid valve disease, the nature of which was only discernible by transoesophageal echocardiography. This case report highlights the importance of being aware of antiphospholipid syndrome as the possible underlying diagnosis in isolated organic tricuspid valve disease and the need for transoesophageal echocardiography in such cases.
