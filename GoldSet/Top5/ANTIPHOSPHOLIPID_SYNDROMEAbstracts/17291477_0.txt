 OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) and/or apolipoprotein (a) (apo(a)) may be markers for clinical features of 37 patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) and to compare with 37 age- and sex-matched controls. METHODS: Apo(a) and Lp(a) concentrations were determined by ELISA and immunonephelometry, respectively. RESULTS: Only elevated apo(a) concentrations were significant predictor for cerebrovascular insults (OR=14.399, p=0.005, 95% CI: 2.224-93.230). CONCLUSION: Considering the fact that PAPS patients with cerebrovascular insults had recurrence of cerebrovascular episodes, measurement of apo(a) concentrations will help in the follow-up of those patients and thus in the prediction of future episodes. This finding should be further investigated in a larger study in order to provide adequate therapeutic intervention.
