We report on a male patient who tested positive for antiphospholipid antibodies for 43Â years without thromboembolic manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). He has been followed up in a prospective cohort study since 2001. Following his second hip replacement surgery, the patient developed acute adrenal failure due to bilateral hemorrhagic infarction. Prophylactic anticoagulation, surgery, or an immunological reaction to blood transfusion may have triggered this late and unusually located primary manifestation of APS in our patient.
