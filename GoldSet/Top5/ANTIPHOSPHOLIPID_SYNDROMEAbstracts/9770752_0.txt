AIM: The study of incidence of clinico-laboratory signs of antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) and the results of its treatment in SLE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Out of 120 patients with verified SLE, 13 (10.8%) had the signs of APLS. They underwent additional tests (platelet and lupus blood anticoagulant assays, assessment of immunity). RESULTS: APLS treatment consisted of suppression of antiphospholipid antibodies production by glucocorticosteroids and cytostatics, removal of antibodies by means of plasmapheresis, HBO therapy of thromboses and vascular defects. APLS in SLE frequently manifested with arterial thromboses, cerebrovasculitis, livedo, thrombocytopenia, lupus anticoagulant. CONCLUSION: Combined treatment of APLS in SLE improves the disease prognosis and prolongs life span.
