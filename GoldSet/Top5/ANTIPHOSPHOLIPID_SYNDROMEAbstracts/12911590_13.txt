Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and maternal complications including thrombotic events and early pre-eclampsia. HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) represents a unique form in the spectrum of pre-eclampsia. This report describes four patients with pregnancy-associated hepatic infarctions. All four had APS and HELLP syndrome, which was complete in one patient and incomplete in three patients, with elevated liver enzymes in all, and either thrombocytopenia or hemolysis in two. In the literature, we found descriptions of an additional 24 patients who had 26 pregnancies with concomitant hepatic infarction. Of the total 28 patients, anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and/or lupus anticoagulant (LAC) were assessed in 16 patients, out of whom 15 were found to be positive. Hepatic infartction during pregnancy was associated almost always with APS, with HELLP (2/3 complete, 1/3 incomplete), and only in one-third of the pregnancies with pre-eclampsia (PE).
