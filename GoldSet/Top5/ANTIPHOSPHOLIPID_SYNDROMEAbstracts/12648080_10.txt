Beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) is an important target antigen for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and thus beta2GPI polymorphisms may influence aPL production and the development of antiphospholipid syndrome. We have studied the relationship between the Val247Leu and Trp316Ser beta2GPI polymorphisms and the aPL status of 230 patients referred for aPL screening. Sixty-one (26.5%) had persistent aPL [anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and/or IgM), lupus anticoagulants and/or IgG anti-beta2GPI antibodies]. A comparison of the genotypic and allelic frequencies of these two polymorphisms between the Caucasian patient population and an ethnic-matched normal control group (n = 308) showed no significant differences between aPL-positive patients, aPL-negative patients and the normal control group. This suggests that the Val or Leu allele at position 247 and the Trp or Ser allele at position 316 of beta2GPI do not play a role in the production of aPL. There was a significantly decreased prevalence of the Ser316 allele in aPL-negative women (n = 98) when compared with female normal control subjects (n = 249) [0.020 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00-0.04]vs 0.060 (95% CI 0.04-0.08), P = 0.0286]. Subgroup analysis showed no significant difference between female patients with thrombosis and female normal control subjects. Thus, the Ser316 allele may protect women from developing pregnancy complications by influencing an anticoagulant function of beta2GPI via a mechanism distinct from aPL production.
