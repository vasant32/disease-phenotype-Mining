Antiphospholipid antibodies are serological markers of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Diversity of so-called antiphospholipid antibodies is well-known. These antibodies are directed against phospholipid binding proteins such as beta(2)-glycoprotein I and prothrombin as well as against phospholipids such as cardiolipin. Thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity are clinical features of APS. In addition, cardiovascular manifestations, neurological disorders, skin manifestations, renal involvements and thrombocytopenia are reported to be significant in clinical aspects of APS. Anticoagulation therapy and antiplatelet therapy are effective for the secondary prevention of thrombosis in APS.
