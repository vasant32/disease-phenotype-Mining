Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious and often fatal complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Several potential mechanisms have been postulated for narrowing of vessels as a result of pulmonary vasculitis and pulmonary thromboembolism caused by antiphospholipid antibodies. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for chronic pulmonary thromboembolism is performed to alleviate pulmonary hypertension. We report three rare cases of SLE with antiphospholipid syndrome in patients who presented with PH secondary to chronic pulmonary thromboembolism. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy was performed, and all patients remained well without deterioration of PH after surgery. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy should be considered as an effective method of treatment for this disease.
