We report the case of a 43-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus who survived three episodes of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. During the first episode symptoms involved predominantly the central nervous system, whilst during the second episode of multiorgan failure, the cardiovascular system, lungs and kidneys were particularly affected. Twenty months later, the patient experienced an acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure and later, died of massive pulmonary embolism. The characteristic findings of antiphospholipid syndrome included persistently high titers of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies, positive lupus anticoagulant, and microcytic anaemia with a distinct haemolytic component.
