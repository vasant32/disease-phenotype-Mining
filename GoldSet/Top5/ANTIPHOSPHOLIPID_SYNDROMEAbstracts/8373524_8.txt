PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of aspirin treatment upon fetal loss in mice with experimental antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental APLS was induced in pregnant mice by passive transfer of mouse monoclonal anticardiolipin antibody. The mice were treated with high (100 micrograms/d) or low (10 micrograms/d) dose of aspirin, using vitamin C (100 micrograms/d or 10 micrograms/d) as a control. The mice were assessed for the presence of lupus anticoagulants (prolonged aPTT), thrombocytopenia, degree of fetal resorption rate and mean embryo and placental weights. RESULTS: The mice with APLS had a higher fetal resorption rate (45.7 +/- 12.2% vs 2.5 +/- 0.4%, P < 0.001), reduced placenta mean weight (104 +/- 8 mg vs 169 +/- 7 mg, P < 0.001), prolonged aPTT (94 +/- 14 sec vs 39 +/- 4 sec, P < 0.001), and reduced mean platelet count (597 +/- 186 x 10(3)/mm3 vs 847 +/- 51 x 10(3)/mm3, P < 0.001). The group of mice with APLS, who were treated with low-dose aspirin, had a lower resorption rate (11.1 +/- 9.3% vs 45.7 +/- 12.2%, P < 0.001), a higher placenta mean weight (178 +/- 8 mg vs 104 +/- 8 mg, P < 0.001), a higher mean embryo weight (1042 +/- 134 mg vs 721 +/- 91 mg, P < 0.001), and a lower aPTT (58 +/- 15 sec vs 94 +/- 14 sec, P < 0.001). Mice who were treated with high-dose aspirin also had a lower resorption rate, although not as much as in the low-dose aspirin group (34.2 +/- 12.7% vs 45.7 +/- 12.2%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Aspirin, especially in low dose, has a protective effect against obstetrical complications associated with experimental APLS.
