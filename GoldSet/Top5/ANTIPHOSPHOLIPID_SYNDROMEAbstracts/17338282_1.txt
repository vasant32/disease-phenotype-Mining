The possible relation between various biological or medical phenomena and changes in environmental physical activity, such as Solar, Geomagnetic Activity (GMA); Cosmic Ray; Proton, and other particle flux, have been reported. These phenomena seem to be reflected, among others, in the immune system, resulting in changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) levels or outbursts of epidemics. AIM: to examine a possible association of GMA with another aspect of the immune system--autoimmunity. Fluctuations of levels of anticardiolipin (IgG; IgM, IgA subtypes) and lupus anticoagulant (Kaulin clotting time and Dilute Russell's viper venom time) autoantibodies, serving as anticardiolipin syndrome (ACLS) markers, were monitored during days of severe GMA storms and compared with those of lowest/quiet GMA days. Cosmophysical data were obtained from the NOAA National Space Service Center and the National Geophysical Data Center, USA. RESULTS: A significant rise in the levels of anti beta2Gp1-IgA (p = 0.0001); and KCT (p = 0.019) was observed on days of the GMA storms. CONCLUSION: On days of major GMA storms, significant changes in the autoimmune marker levels of ACLS were observed compared with quiet days. An involvement of those changes in clinical events related to GMA storms is possible.
