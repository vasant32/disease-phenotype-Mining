Visceral leishmaniasis or Kala-azar is an endemic parasitic infection in Mediterranean countries. We report an interesting case occurring in a 38-year-old woman suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. In our patient visceral leishmaniasis occurred during high dose-steroids treatment mimicking a flare of lupus. As the lupus resolved under immunosuppressive treatment, a reactivation of visceral leishmaniasis was observed and was confirmed by the successive serological tests which showed crossing of leishmania and antinuclear antibody titers. Our case shows that, faced with fever occurring in lupus patients in an endemic area, visceral leishmaniasis should be searched for before intensifying immunosuppressive treatments.
