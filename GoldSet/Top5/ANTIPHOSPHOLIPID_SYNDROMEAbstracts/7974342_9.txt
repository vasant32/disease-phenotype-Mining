A patient with a history of habitual abortion, deep venous thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, high titer IgG anticardiolipin antibodies and a clearly positive lupus anticoagulant, was treated during her seventh pregnancy with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) from the third month onwards. Every month, a daily infusion of 400 mg immunoglobulins per kg body weight was given during five consecutive days. The patient's pregnancy ended preterm with a live birth, delivered by caesarian section because of a placental abruption. The 1070 g (P20-P25) weighing girl was in good health, apart from a bradycardia, due to dysfunction of the atrioventricular conduction. Each treatment with IVIg resulted in a slight reduction of both anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant levels and in an increase in platelet count. During the six-month observation period, a gradual decline in antiphospholipid antibodies and an increase in platelet count was found. The potential role of anti-idiotypic antibodies, present in the IVIg used for treatment, was studied. In vitro, IVIg were able to reduce the binding of the patient's anticardiolipin antibodies to cardiolipin coated microtiter plates. The presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies in IVIg was further documented by affinity chromatography and by realtime biospecific interaction analysis (BIA) on a BIA-core instrument. Affinity purified anticardiolipin antibodies were retarded on a column of insolubilized IVIg and a weak interaction was found between IVIg and affinity purified antiphospholipid antibodies, coupled to the BIA-core biosensor. In addition, the same technology revealed increased levels of anti-antiphospholipid antibodies in the patient's plasma following IVIg therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
