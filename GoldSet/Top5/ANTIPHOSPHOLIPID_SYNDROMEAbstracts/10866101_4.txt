It has been reported that paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity inhibits low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and modulates the risk of coronary heart disease. This study shows that autoantibodies (IgG) directed against modified LDL were increased in 71 patients positive for anticardiolipin antibodies. In a representative subgroup of these patients (n = 36) PON1 activity was dramatically decreased and the prevalence of the RR genotype of this enzyme tended to be increased in patients who had developed arterial thrombosis. This study suggests that PON1 abnormalities play a role in the antiphospholipid syndrome.
