A 23-year-old woman, who had nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma since her childhood, was diagnosed as nephrotic syndrome caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She was pregnant but experienced fetal loss at the age of 25. Although 10 mg/day of oral prednisolone was administered, low levels of serum complement, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia (6.0 x 10(4)/mm3) and biological false positive for STS continued. When she was 27 years old, right hemichorea developed. She was admitted to our hospital at the age of 28 because of low levels of serum complement, high titers of anti ds-DNA antibody, profuse proteinuria, gingival bleeding and thrombocytopenia (1.5 x 10(4)/mm3). The nephrotic syndrome gradually improved after 1 g/day of methylprednisolone for 2 days and the oral prednisolone dosage was then increased up to 40 mg/day, and was tapered to 10 mg/day. Epileptic attack (minor seizure) occurred at the age of 29. Continuous low levels of serum complement and high titers of anti ds-DNA antibody were improved by adding 50 mg/day of cyclophosphamide. However, high levels of beta 2 GPI dependent anticardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant activity were observed throughout the study. Our patient was a very rare case of congenital ichthyosis with typical antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and SLE. A few cases of acquired ichthyosis associated with SLE has been reported, and ichthyosis developed only in active stage of SLE. However, our patient's ichthyosiform lesions were not changed throughout the course.
