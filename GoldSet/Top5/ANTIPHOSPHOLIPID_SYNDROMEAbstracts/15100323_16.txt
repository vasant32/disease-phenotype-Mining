The combined presence of anti-phospholipid Ab (aPL) and thrombosis is recognized as the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The aPL represent a heterogeneous group of Ab that recognize various phospholipids (PL), PL-binding plasma proteins, and/or PL-protein complexes. Recently, we found the presence of antithrombin Ab in some APS patients and that some of these anti-thrombin Ab could inhibit thrombin inactivation by antithrombin. Considering that thrombin is homologous to plasmin, which dissolves fibrin, we hypothesize that some APS patients may have Ab that react with plasmin, and that some anti-plasmin Ab may interfere with the plasmin-mediated lysis of fibrin clots. To test this hypothesis, we searched for anti-plasmin Ab in APS patients and then studied those found for their effects on the fibrinolytic pathway. The results revealed that seven of 25 (28%) APS patients have IgG anti-plasmin Ab (using the mean OD plus 3 SD of 20 normal controls as the cutoff) and that six of six patient-derived IgG anti-thrombin mAb bind to plasmin with relative K(d) values ranging from 5.6 x 10(-8) to 1 x 10(-6) M. These K(d) values probably represent affinities in the higher ranges known for human IgG autoantibodies against protein autoantigens. Of these mAb, one could reduce the plasmin-mediated lysis of fibrin clots. These findings suggest that plasmin may be an important driving Ag for some aPL B cells in APS patients, and that the induced anti-plasmin Ab may act either directly, by binding to plasmin and inhibiting its fibrinolytic activity, or indirectly, by cross-reacting with other homologous proteins in the coagulation cascade to promote thrombosis.
