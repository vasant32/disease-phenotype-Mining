Generalized chronic cutaneous lupus including lupus panniculitis in childhood is rare and usually occurs in the setting of genetic complement deficiencies. The association with antiphospholipid syndrome is even more rare. We report a 13-year-old girl with extensive lupus panniculitis since the age of 8 months and no evidence of complement deficiency. She recently developed antiphospholipid syndrome characterized by anticardiolipin antibodies and digital necrosis.
