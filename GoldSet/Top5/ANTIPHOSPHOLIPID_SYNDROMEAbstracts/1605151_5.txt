Three cases of optic neuropathy associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome are reported. All three patients had clinical manifestations of primary Sjögren's syndrome, although two of the patients did not report sicca symptoms at initial examination. Two patients had focal neurologic signs in addition to optic neuropathy. The differentiation of this syndrome of optic neuropathy, focal neurologic signs, and Sjögren's syndrome from multiple sclerosis and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is important for reasons of treatment and prognosis. This diagnostic differentiation was facilitated by positive tests for xerophthalmia and findings of positive minor salivary gland biopsy. High titers of antinuclear antibody, anti-SSA(Ro), and anti-SSB(La), and the absence of antiphospholipid antibodies provided additional help in the differential diagnosis. In 5 years of observation, none of the patients developed symptoms of multiple sclerosis or additional connective tissue disorders.
