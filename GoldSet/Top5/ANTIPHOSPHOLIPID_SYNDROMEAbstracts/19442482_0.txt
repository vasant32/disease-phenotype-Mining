Lower limb arterial disease has unusual features when occurring before 50 years old. The most important one is the number of causes: atherosclerosis in 2/3 cases, Leo Buerger's disease in 1/4, but also sometimes embolic cardiopathies, antiphospholipid syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, genetic or compressive diseases, inflammatory arterial disease. When peripheral arterial disease occurs before 50, explorations have to be performed according to anamnesis: duplex echography, EKG, blood sample. Afterwards other explorations may be performed such as other vascular imaging techniques, echocardiography or more complete biological investigation. Results from an ongoing multicenter study should be soon available and give more knowledge about these special peripheral arterial diseases.
