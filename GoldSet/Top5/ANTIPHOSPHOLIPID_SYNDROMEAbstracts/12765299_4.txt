Anti-prothrombin antibodies (aPT) are associated with thrombotic manifestations, and their association with reproductive failure is debatable. The aim of this study was to examine whether aPT could induce thrombosis and other clinical manifestations of the anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS). Mice were immunized with either prothrombin, beta2-glycoprotein-I (beta2GPI), or beta2GPI followed by prothrombin. The presence of clinical manifestation of APS, including thrombocytopenia, lupus anticoagulant and fetal resorption rates, was evaluated in all mice groups compared with nonimmunized mice. Thrombosis was studied in a novel ex-vivo model in which the aorta was sutured for 1 min and the presence or absence of visible thrombus was qualitatively evaluated. Immunized mice developed high autoantibody levels directed towards their immunizing autoantigens. The groups immunized with beta2GPI or beta2GPI/prothrombin, but not with prothrombin alone, developed prolonged aPTT, thrombocytopenia and increased fetal resorption rate. All prothrombin-immunized mice as well as most beta2GPI/prothrombin-immunized mice developed visible thrombus within the aorta. Some beta2GPI immunized mice developed very mild thrombus. None of the CFA/PBS-injected or the nonimmunized mice developed such thrombus. Active immunization with prothrombin or beta2GPI/prothrombin is associated with prothrombotic activity of blood in an ex-vivo model. This is the first direct evidence for thrombus induction by aPT.
