 BACKGROUND: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined as the presence of venous or arterial thrombosis, and/or recurrent miscarriage with evidence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). In both primary and secondary APS, ocular and neurophthalmic manifestations such as retinal arteritis, retinal venous occlusion, ischemic optic neuropathy, transient loss of vision - amaurosis fugax, diplopia have been reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present an unusual case of APS in a healthy 24-year old male who had isolated ocular presentation with recurrent right periocular oedema and non-healing ulceration of the biopsy site without systemic involvement. Ocular examinations and investigations including inflammatory markers were normal. CONCLUSION: Atypical presentations of APS may result in initial difficulty in making diagnosis.
