Beta-2-GPI is a 50 kDa glycoprotein which is known to be a serum co-factor, with a role in determining the binding of pathogenic anticardiolipin antibodies to phospholipids. Immunization of naive mice with beta-2-GPI resulted in elevated levels of antibodies directed against negatively charged phospholipids (cardiolipin, phosphotidylserine, phosphatidylinositol). The presence of increased titres of antiphospholipid antibodies in the sera of the mice was later followed by prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombocytopenia, and when the mice were mated, by a high percentage of fetal resorptions in the uterus. These data point to the ability of beta-2-GPI to induce pathogenic anti-cardiolipin antibodies following active immunization.
