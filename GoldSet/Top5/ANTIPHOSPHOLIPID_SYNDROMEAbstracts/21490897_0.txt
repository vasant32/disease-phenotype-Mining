We report two cases of Budd-Chiari syndrome. Case 1: A 57-year-old man presented with leg edema and esophageal varices. Cavography showed obstruction of the inferior vena cava with antiphospholipid syndrome. Further, the patient showed positive serology for hepatitis C virus and consumed large quantities of alcohol. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed on this patient and anticoagulants administered; leg edema and esophageal varices were ameliorated although liver biopsy showed cirrhosis without evident congestion. More than 9 months since the diagnosis, restenosis of the inferior vena cava has not occurred. Case 2: A 73-year-old woman presented abdominal pain but no edema or varices. Cavography showed membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava which required no therapy. Manifestation of portal hypertension was not present and liver function was maintained although liver biopsy showed obvious congestion. These cases showed untypical features against histopathology, and careful observation will be required for emergence of hepatocellular carcinoma.
