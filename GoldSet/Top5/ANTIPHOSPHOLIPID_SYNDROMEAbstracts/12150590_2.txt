Acute vascular events are rare in the pediatric population, but there is an association with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. When there is no other underlying medical disorder, this is referred to as primary antiphospholipid syndrome. We present a case of a 15-year-old boy who developed an acute superior branch retinal artery occlusion. Complete evaluation revealed significant elevations in antiphospholipid antibodies. To our knowledge, there are no cases in children of primary antiphospholipid syndrome presenting with this clinical manifestation.
