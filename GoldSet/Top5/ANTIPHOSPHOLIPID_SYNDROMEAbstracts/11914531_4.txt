A total of 139 young stroke patients were consecutively examined and tested for antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) to evaluate the role of these antibodies in cerebral ischaemia before the age of 45. APLA were found in 28.8% of patients. Two factors, hypertriglyceridaemia and alcohol abuse, were significantly more frequent in patients with a positive APLA test. The demographic characteristics, other risk factors, history of prior thrombotic events and distribution of aetiopathogenic types of cerebral ischaemia were not different in patients with or without APLA. Laboratory assays for APLA were highly positive for only two patients, who both had autoimmune diseases. These results suggest that with the exception of a clinical context of antiphospholipid syndrome or other autoimmune diseases, the usefulness of this diagnostic tool in the management of cerebral ischaemia remains limited.
