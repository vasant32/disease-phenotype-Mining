 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of antiphospholipid antibodies on eicosanoid production by human decidual cells and the in vitro interaction between antiphospholipid antibodies and secretory phospholipase A2. DESIGN: Cultures of human decidual cells from early pregnancy. SETTING: All decidual specimens were obtained from the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of the Catholic University, Rome, Italy. PATIENT(S): Patients were undergoing operative laparoscopy for extrauterine pregnancy, with a period of amenorrhea ranging from 6 to 9 weeks. INTERVENTION(S): Decidual samples were collected at laparoscopy by routine uterine curettage. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Decidual cells were incubated with antiphospholipid antibodies, and eicosanoids (prostaglandin [PG] E2, PGF2alpha, and thromboxane B2) were assayed by RIA after 24 hours of culture. In vitro interactions between antiphospholipid antibodies and secretory phospholipase A2 were investigated with use of a modified ELISA for phospholipase A2. RESULT(S): Antiphospholipid antibodies reduced eicosanoid release from decidual cells in a dose-dependent fashion. In vitro assays showed that antiphospholipid antibodies bound secretory phospholipase A2 and that a competition occurred between antiphospholipid antibodies and secretory phospholipase A2 for the common substrate cardiolipin. CONCLUSION(S): In light of the critical role played by eicosanoids in decidual function, we suggest that an interaction between antiphospholipid antibodies and secretory phospholipase A2 occurring in vivo might impair important cellular communications at the decidual level in the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
