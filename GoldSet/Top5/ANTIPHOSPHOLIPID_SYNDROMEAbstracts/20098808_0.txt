Coronary thrombosis as a manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome is very uncommon. We report a 25 year-old male without known cardiovascular risk factors that suffered an acute myocardial infarction as the initial manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome. His coronary angiogram demonstrated a single thrombotic lesion in the anterior descending artery without coronary atheromatosis. Anticardiolipin, anti B2 Glycoprotein I antibodies, and lupus anticoagulant were all positive. Besides the usual management of the coronary thrombosis, the patient was treated with permanent oral anticoagulation. Three months later, a CT coronary angiogram showed complete reperfusion of the involved artery .
