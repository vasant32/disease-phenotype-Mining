We described a 10-year-old girl with SLE complicated with anticardiolipin antibody, who showed bleeding tendency since infant. Her platelet was 6 x 10(3)/microliter. The APTT was remarkably prolonged. The platelet count was normalized after steroid treatment. A false positive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, lupus anticoagulants and anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM) were positive. Her symptoms and the laboratory data fulfilled the criteria of antiphospholipid syndrome. Renal biopsy was performed because of proteinuria, hematuria and the positive of anti-nuclear antibody. The pathology of kidney showed that of lupus nephritis (diffuse membranous glomerulonephritis), and she was diagnosed SLE. She showed no laboratory findings of hyperfibrinolysis and no symptoms of thrombosis under the steroid treatment for 3 years.
