A 48-year-old woman presented to our hospital with epigastralgia and erythema on the left dorsalis pedis. Her medical history included deep venous thrombosis three months prior to admission to our hospital. Upon admission it was determined that she had severe anemia (hemoglobin level 4.6 g/dl). Bone marrow analysis indicated a markedly decreased number of erythroid progenitor cells. A skin biopsy specimen of the erythema revealed microthrombus. Anticardiolipin-beta2GPI antibody and lupus anticoagulant were positive. The patient was diagnosed with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). After steroid pulse therapy and warfarinization, her anemia and purpura improved. Three months later she developed depression with positive anti-ribosomal P protein antibody that was indicative of central nervous system lupus. Although her psychometric condition did not respond to steroid pulse therapy, improvement was seen after she received three courses of cyclophosphamide pulse therapy. We report a rare case of CNS lupus that developed during corticosteroid therapy and warfarinization in a patient with PRCA and APS.
