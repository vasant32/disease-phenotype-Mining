We describe a 29-year-old pregnant woman at 16 weeks gestation and antiphospholipid antibodies who developed nephrotic syndrome with massive hematuria. Renal biopsy evidenced chronic glomerular lesions of ischemic nature without proliferative changes and immune deposits suggestive of lupus nephritis. Anticoagulation was initiated, along supportive measures, and the patient recovered completely. This case demonstrates that chronic renal lesions of antiphospholipid syndrome may present with marked clinical manifestation including hypertension, massive proteinuria and hematuria, resembling the course of acute thrombotic microangiopathy and/or lupus nephritis.
