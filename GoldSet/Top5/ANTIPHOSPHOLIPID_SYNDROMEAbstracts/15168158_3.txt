We report on a 32-year old female patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) and several thromboembolic events despite stable doses of oral anticoagulation, good patient compliance and maintained INR values of >3. Over the preceding 3 years the patient had presented a wide spectrum of manifestations of APS, including recurrent venous and arterial thromboses, cardiac, gynecological (HELLP syndrome), neurological involvements, livedo reticularis, a mild thrombocytopenia and the most feared manifestation of the catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). Life-threatening bilateral subdural bleeding occurred while she was anticoagulated. The clinical features appeared to be refractory to oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon. They were life threatening on each occasion and she developed repetitive episodes of organ damage with cardiac insufficiency (NYHA III), pulmonary hypertension and other residual defects. Even during heparinization recurrent thromboembolism supervened as well as livedo reticularis of the extremities. Lupus anticoagulants (LAC), anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein-1 (beta(2)GPI) titers were all markedly elevated. This case report shows that recurrent episodes of thrombosis can occur despite seemingly adequate anticoagulation in patients with CAPS.
