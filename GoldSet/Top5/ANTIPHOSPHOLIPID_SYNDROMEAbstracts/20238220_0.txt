Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a disease with important relationships to autoimmune mechanisms. Although some autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, have been associated with PRCA, until this point no studies have described the association between PRCA and primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This is the first case report of PRCA associated with primary APS in a 39-year-old man with acute heart failure secondary to an anaemic condition that was diagnosed as pure red cell aplasia. The patient was later diagnosed with retinal artery and vein thromboses and bilateral deep venous thromboses of the femoral and popliteal veins. The most common causes of PRCA and other thrombophilias were ruled out in this investigation through complementary tests. This association with APS adds a new possibility to the study of PRCA pathophysiology.
