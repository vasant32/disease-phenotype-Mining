SLE patients with identified and probable APS compared with those having no APS have been found to have more significant endothelial function disorders, carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and intensity of atherosclerotic vascular impairment. At the same time antibody level to beta-2-glycoprotein 1 reliably correlates (r= 0.39, 0.38, 0.33) with endothelial dysfunction specificity and carotic artery atherosclerotic impairment. The development of structural and functional myocardial defect in SLE patients less depends on APS presence. Persons with high antibody level to beta-2-glycoprotein 1 were found to have oftener a left ventricular myocardial hyperthrophy and impairment of diastolic heart function than patients with no antibodies to beta-2-glycoprotein 1.
