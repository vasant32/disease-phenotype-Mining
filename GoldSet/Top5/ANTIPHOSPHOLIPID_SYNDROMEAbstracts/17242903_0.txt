We present the case of a woman whose psychiatric clinical picture was the major manifestation of SLE with unrecognized secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. The atypical onset and the subsequent clinical course of the psychiatric manifestations led to the diagnosis. This case demonstrates the heterogeneous progress of SLE, the increasing relevance of the antiphospholipid antibodies in the central nervous system and the difficulty in making an early diagnosis.
