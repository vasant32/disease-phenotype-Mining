Current management of primary or secondary antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) syndromes with known embolic phenomena requiring anticoagulation is empiric in the setting of elective orthopedic procedures. Short-term withdrawal of warfarin with continuance of aspirin and glucocorticoid therapy was undertaken for sequential bilateral knee replacements in a lupus patient with aPL. Her course was successfully managed without thrombo-embolic complications.
