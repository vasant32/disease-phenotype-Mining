Four cases of adrenal insufficiency due to bilateral adrenal haemorrhage in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome are reported. The 1st patient had repeated episodes of thrombosis on a background of altered general condition; he was examined by computed tomography (CT) which showed enlarged and presumably tumoral adrenal glands; adrenal insufficiency was present and improved under hormone replacement therapy; the thrombotic episodes were attributed to the antiphospholipid antibodies; after a 5-year follow-up the antiphospholipid syndrome remained alone, and further examinations showed progressive adrenal atrophy. The 2nd patient had systemic lupus erythematosus with thrombocytopenia; because of abdominal pain CT was performed, showing bilateral adrenal enlargement; treatment with intravenous pulses of cyclophosphamide and high-dose immunoglobulins combined with corticosteroids failed, and splenectomy was performed disclosing an old adrenal haematoma which was evacuated. The 3rd patient had bilateral and asymmetrical adrenal hypertrophy at CT; subsequently, systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed with anti-prothrombinase and anticardiolipin accounting for the initial findings; follow-up examinations showed the formation of pseudocysts in the adrenals; following myocardial infarction the patient died of cerebral haemorrhage, and autopsy confirmed the presence of old, bilateral adrenal haematomas. The 4th patient had recurrent vein thrombosis associated with distal ischaemia, which prompted CT in search of a neoplasia; this examination revealed 2 large adrenal haematomas while anticardiolipin antibodies were found. In patients with antiphospholipid syndrome any functional or morphological abnormality of the adrenals should prompt a search for bilateral adrenal haemorrhage. Conversely, in all cases of adrenal insufficiency a search for antiphospholipid antibodies should be part of all aetiological investigations, and this search should be carried out prior to withdrawing corticosteroids in cases of systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid antibodies.
