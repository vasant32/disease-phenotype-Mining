Unresponsive autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) may require therapy with second-line drugs. There is no consensus that any one of these agents is more effective than another. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive drug proven to be effective in reducing renal allograft rejection as well as being used in autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We describe its use in two patients who were treated with MMF for AIHA in the context of underlying SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The patients showed a good response to treatment with MMF, suggesting a possible role in the treatment of AIHA.
