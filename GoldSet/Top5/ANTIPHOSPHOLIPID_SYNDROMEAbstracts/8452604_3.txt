Two girls, 22 months and 12 years of age, presented with repeated cerebral infarctions in association with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. The younger patient also suffered from protein C deficiency, while the other one had protein S and complement C4 deficiencies. All other causes of cerebral infarction were excluded; however, vasculitis remains a possibility in one patient. Both girls developed spastic tetraparesis as a sequela of the previous infarctions. The two patients were treated with aspirin and prednisone, with remission of the infarctions during the next 8 months of observation. A primary deficiency of protein C or S is proposed which would produce cerebral thrombosis with exposure of phospholipids; this thrombosis then, like antigens, would generate antibodies acting on the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, exacerbating the thrombotic process. The association of complement C4 deficiency is an additional risk factor.
