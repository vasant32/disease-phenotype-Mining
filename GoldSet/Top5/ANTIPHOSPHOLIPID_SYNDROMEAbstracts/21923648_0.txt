In this work, we proposed to determine the association of the PTPN22*R620W SNP with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) in a case-control association study of Spanish Caucasian individuals. A total of 81 PAPS patients were compared with 81 blood-donor healthy control subjects. PTPN22 SNP (R620W) genotyping was performed by using a polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism assay. No statistically significant differences were found between control subjects and PAPS patients for the PTPN22*R620W genotypes (P = 0.214). No statistically significant differences were found according to either the presence or absence of antiphospholipid antibodies or the clinical manifestations associated to PAPS. Our results indicate that this functional PTPN22*R620W polymorphism is not associated to PAPS; it seems not to be a risk factor in our Spanish population. The effect of the PTPN22 SNP on clinical manifestations and presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in APS warrants further investigations.
