Cardiovascular catastrophes (myocardial infarction and stroke occur relatively rarely during pregnancy, but they are menacing complications that frequently result in a fatal outcome. The global pattern of vascular catastrophes determines the need for applying an interdisciplinary approach to this problem and for combining the efforts of different specialists, such as obstetricians, gynecologists, cardiologists, neurologists, and therapists. To study the causes of gestational cardiovascular events and the mechanisms of their development, to devise methods for their diagnosis, prevention, and therapy are a topical problem in the present-day medical practice. The same etiological factors may cause both ischemic and hemorrhagic complications, as well as their coconcomitant forms.
