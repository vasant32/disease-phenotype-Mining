A case of lupus anticoagulant and repeated fetal loss with a successful delivery of a healthy baby after transfer of thawed frozen embryos and intravenous immunoglobulin administration is described. The repeated fetal loss was due to vascular disturbances caused by lupus anticoagulants. Early implantation was not affected. Anticoagulants and/or steroids did not help in further establishing pregnancy. Intravenous immunoglobulin combined with heparin and aspirin led to term pregnancy and the birth of a healthy child.
