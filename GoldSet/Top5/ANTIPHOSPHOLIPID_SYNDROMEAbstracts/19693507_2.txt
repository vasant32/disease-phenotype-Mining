Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a form of reactive lymphadenopathy, which was firstly described in Japan, but is uncommon in the Western world. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of nine cases of adult or adolescent Kikuchi's disease diagnosed in a single Haematology Unit in Athens, Greece between 1990 and 2006. The median age of the patients was 25 years (14-40) and 8/9 were females. All patients presented with cervical lymphadenopathy sparing the supraclavicular fossa; one had associated axillary lymphadenopathy, seven had fever and two were asymptomatic. The median duration of lymphadenopathy before presentation was 30 days (10-45). Just palpable splenomegaly was recorded in three patients. The median value of the maximal lymph node diameter was 2 cm (1-5) and only 1/9 had nodes >2 cm in their largest diameter. Lymphadenopathy was tender in two patients; hard nodes were observed in three patients. The median leukocyte count was 4.7 x 10(9)/l (2.2-4.9) with a normal differential in 7/9 patients. No infectious agent could be demonstrated. One patient had clinical and laboratory evidence of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS). In conclusion, Kikuchi's disease represents a rare but important diagnostic possibility for patients presenting with lymphadenopathy in Greece and other western countries. In this setting, autoimmune disorders, mainly lupus and APLS, should be considered and excluded by the appropriate laboratory work-up.
