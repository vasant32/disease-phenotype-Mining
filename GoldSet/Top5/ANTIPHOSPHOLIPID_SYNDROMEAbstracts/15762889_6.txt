Lyso(bis)phosphatidic acid (LBPA) is a novel antigenic target in anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) and antibodies directed against LBPA (aLBPA) have been detected in sera from APS patients. In this study we first evaluated aLBPA in comparison with the most widely used methods (i.e. anticardiolipin [(aCL)-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)] and antibeta-2-glycoprotein-I antibodies (abeta(2)-GPI-ELISA) utilized to detect antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with primary or secondary APS, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic HCV infection and healthy subjects. We then assessed the relationship between aLBPA, lupus anticoagulant (LAC) and the main clinical manifestations of APS. Finally, we evaluated the presence of 'pure' (i.e. beta(2)-GPI-independent) aLBPA in patients with APS and controls. The results indicate that aLBPA as well as abeta(2)-GPI display higher specificity but lower sensitivity for APS compared to aCL. Moreover, serum aLBPA correlate closely with aCL and abeta(2)-GPI in APS patients and are strictly associated with LAC positivity. We demonstrate that beta(2)-GPI binds to LBPA with affinity similar to CL, and antibodies able to react with phosholipid-protein complex exist; however, 'pure' aLBPA can also be detected in sera of APS patients. Altogether these data confirm that LBPA may be an antigenic target in APS and that aLBPA are serological markers of APS with similar sensitivity and specificity compared to abeta(2)-GPI. However, the clinical utility of aLBPA detection alone or in combination with aCL and/or abeta(2)-GPI remains to be elucidated in larger and longitudinal studies.
