INTRODUCTION: Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder, defined as the association of antiphospholipid antibodies with manifestations of venous or arterial thrombosis or pregnancy loss. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome means that the patients have the same clinical symptoms and laboratory findings but they are not suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus or a closely related autoimmune diseases. Secondary antiphospholipid syndrome occurs in association with autoimmune or other diseases. AIM, METHODS, RESULTS: 31 pregnancies of 10 women are detailed. 22 pregnancies were without thromboembolic prophylaxis and only 2 pregnancies were successful (9.1%). Out of the 9 pregnancies with high dose low-molecular-weight heparin and low dose aspirin thromboprophylaxis throughout pregnancy 8 were successful (88.8%). All the newborns were healthy. In spite of the long-term low-molecular-weight heparin therapy side effects (osteoporosis or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) were not observed. CONCLUSION: Considering these results high-dose low-molecular-weight heparin and low dose aspirin prophylaxis is recommended for pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome throughout pregnancy.
