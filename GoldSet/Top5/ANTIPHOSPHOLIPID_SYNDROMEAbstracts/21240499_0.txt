The significance of beta2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) polymorphisms in the production of anti-β2GPI and other antiphospholipid autoantibodies (aPL) and in the pathogenesis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) is not well understood. We performed a study comparing the distribution of polymorphisms at codons 247 (Val247Leu) and 316 (Trp316Ser) of the β2GPI gene in a Caucasian Spanish population of PAPS patients and healthy controls, and then making correlations with the development of anti-β2GPI antibodies and other aPL and associated clinical manifestations. A total of 57 PAPS patients and 100 control subjects were included. In the analysis of Val247Leu polymorphism, alleles (V and L) and genotypes (V/V, V/L, L/L) were similarly distributed in PAPS patients and controls (P = 0.66 and P = 0.22, respectively). Regarding Trp316Ser polymorphism, we found a higher percentage of patients with respect to controls expressing S allele (11.4 vs. 5%, P = 0.02) and T/S genotype (22.8 vs. 10%, P = 0.02). However, when we compared T/T and T/S genotypes in PAPS patients, we found no differences regarding generation of anti-β2GPI, other aPL and clinical manifestations favoring any genotype. Our findings suggest that among Spanish Caucasians, polymorphisms at codon 247 (Val247Leu) do not seem to influence PAPS pathogenesis. On the contrary, polymorphisms at codon 316 (Trp316Ser), by means of an increased S allele and T/S genotype presence in Spanish Caucasian patients, might play a role in the pathogenic development of PAPS, although mechanism would not involve an increased production of anti-β2GPI and other aPL.
