Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is the association between antiphospholipid antibodies, venous and arterial thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity. Although the kidney may be affected in APS, the treatment of renal involvement is yet to be elucidated. This report describes the clinical and laboratory features of four patients with primary APS nephropathy, and the beneficial effect of immunosuppressive therapy accompanied by warfarin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. We also briefly discuss the possible mechanisms of the beneficial effects of immunosuppressives on primary APS nephropathy.
