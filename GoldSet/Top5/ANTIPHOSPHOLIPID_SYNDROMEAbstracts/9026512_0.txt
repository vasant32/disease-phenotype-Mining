OBJECTIVE: Primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is by definition associated with high obstetric risk. We performed a retrospective study of pregnancies in women with this syndrome in an attempt to define a common means of caring these patients. STUDY DESIGN: Women with APS followed in Internal Medicine Department and in Gynecology Department since 1989 were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: Fifteen women with primary APS had a total of 51 pregnancies, 39 (76%) of which ended in embryonic (n = 24) or fetal (n = 15) loss. Only 6/39 untreated pregnancies led to a live birth, including 2 cases of intrauterine growth retardation. Among the 12 pregnancies treated preventively for obstetric complications, 6 led to a live birth. The treatments used were dissimilar and included aspirin, corticosteroids and heparin, either alone or in association. Four of these 6 live births were obtained by aspirin alone. Gravidic toxemia was observed in one untreated patient. CONCLUSION: The obstetric prognosis for untreated APS is appalling. The benefit of heparin therapy in association with aspirin remains to be demonstrated, ideally in a protocol comparing aspirin alone with aspirin and heparin.
