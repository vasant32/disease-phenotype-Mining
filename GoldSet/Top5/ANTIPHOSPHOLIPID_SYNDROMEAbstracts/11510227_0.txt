We experienced a case of lupus nephritis with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. A renal biopsy specimen from this patient showed various renal histological changes, but the results of urinalysis were almost normal. The patient was a 56-year-old woman diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in 1983. In 1998, she had diarrhea and blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis. Therefore, she was admitted to our hospital and underwent renal function examination. The glomerular filtration rate was reduced(GFR: 40/ml/min), but urinalysis was almost normal. To examine her renal dysfunction, we performed open renal biopsy. Her renal tissues showed global glomerular sclerosis, mesangial cell proliferation and infiltration of cells in the tubulointerstitial area(WHO II). Furthermore, some arterioles showed organized thrombus formation and recanalization due to the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Renal biopsy of patients with lupus nephritis is useful not only for precise diagnosis, but also for the selection of appropriate treatment.
