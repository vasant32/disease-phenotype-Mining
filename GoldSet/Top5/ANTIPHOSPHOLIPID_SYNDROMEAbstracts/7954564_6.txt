Antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are often associated with thrombosis, recurrent abortions and thrombocytopenia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac valvular abnormalities in patients with SLE and to establish the relationship between the echographic findings and the presence of an antiphospholipid syndrome. A total of 52 consecutive patients with SLE and 52 healthy sex- and age-matched controls were therefore evaluated in a cross-sectional study. All underwent M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography, color-flow imaging, pulsed and continuous-wave Doppler. In the SLE group, subjects exposed to antiphospholipid syndrome (n = 20) were compared to controls. Patients with SLE had significantly more mitral (p = 0.032; RR 2.48; 1.25-5.6) and tricuspid regurgitations (p = 0.0016; RR 2.41; 1.58-8.85). There was no significant difference between either group for mitral valve thickness (p = 0.66). The antiphospholipid syndrome was significantly associated with increased relative risk for tricuspid.
