We have studied target platelet antigens in 22 patients with lupus anticoagulants and a primary antiphospholipid syndrome in order to determine whether any specificities of platelet autoantibodies are correlated with thromboembolism, and if these antibodies cross-react with phospholipids, which would suggest their role in the development of thromboembolic disease. Platelet counts were median 203 x 10(9)/l, range 100-298 x 10(9)/l. Platelet antibodies were found in six thrombocytopenic patients and in further nine patients. All these 15 patients had antibodies against GPIIb/ IIIa, five patients against GPIb/IX, and six patients against GPIV. Anti-GPIb/IX and -GPIV occurred only in combination with anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies. There was no correlation between the presence of detectable platelet antibodies or any of their glycoprotein specificity and thrombocytopenia or the history of a thromboembolic disease. Eluates from platelets contained only GPIIb/IIIa reactivities, but neither anti-GPIb/IX nor anti-GPIV. None of the eluates contained lupus anticoagulant activity. In one case, the platelet eluates contained anti-GPIIb/IIIa and anticardiolipin IgG antibodies. These results suggest that in patients with a primary antiphospholipid syndrome the presence of platelet autoantibodies neither indicate a risk for thromboembolic disorder nor have lupus anticoagulant activity.
