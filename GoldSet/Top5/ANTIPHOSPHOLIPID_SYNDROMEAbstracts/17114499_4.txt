Antiphospholipid Ab have been shown to promote thrombosis and fetal loss in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Previously, we found IgG anti-thrombin Ab in some APS patients that could interfere with inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin (AT). Considering that activated coagulation factor X (FXa) is homologous to thrombin in the catalytic domains and is also regulated primarily by AT, we hypothesized that some thrombin-reactive Ab may bind to FXa and interfere with AT inactivation of FXa. To test these hypotheses, we studied reactivity of eight patient-derived monoclonal IgG antiphospholipid Ab with FXa and the presence of IgG anti-FXa Ab in APS patients and investigated the effects of FXa-reactive mAb on AT inactivation of FXa. The results revealed that six of six thrombin-reactive IgG mAb bound to FXa and that the levels of plasma IgG anti-FXa Ab in 38 APS patients were significantly higher than those in 30 normal controls (p < 0.001). When the mean plus 3 SDs of the 30 normal controls was used as the cutoff, 5 of 38 APS patients (13.2%) had IgG anti-FXa Ab. Importantly, three of six FXa-reactive mAb significantly inhibited AT inactivation of FXa. Combined, these results indicate that anti-FXa Ab may contribute to thrombosis by interfering with the anticoagulant function of AT on FXa in some APS patients.
