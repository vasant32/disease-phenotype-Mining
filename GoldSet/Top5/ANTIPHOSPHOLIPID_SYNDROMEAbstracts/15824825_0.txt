 BACKGROUND: Thrombophilia is an alteration of hemostasis that increases the risk to venous or arterial thrombosis. This condition may be the underlying cause of retinal vein thrombosis. AIM: To study the presence of thrombophilia in patients with retinal vein thrombosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective study of 55 patients aged 22 to 86 years, with retinal vein thrombosis (central or branch). Antithrombin III, coagulant protein C, functional protein S, resistance to activated C protein, homocysteine, prothrombin G20210A gene, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were measured in all. RESULTS: Seventeen patients had thrombophilic markers (antiphospholipid syndrome in seven, hyperhomocysteinemia in six and resistance to protein C in three). Of these 17 patients, 53% had high blood pressure, 35% an abnormal serum lipid profile and 23% a personal history of thrombosis. The thrombosis was central in 12 (ischemic in four) and of a branch in five (ischemic in two). CONCLUSIONS: Thrombophilic markers must be assessed in patients with retinal vein thrombosis.
