We report the case of a young lady with primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, who had two spontaneous abortions and cerebral venous thrombosis and subsequently deep vein thrombosis of the leg veins. Three classes of antiphospholipid antibodies (IgG, IgM, IgA) were elevated. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence for other autoimmune or systemic illnesses. We are presenting the case due to the rarity of the same.
