Complement C5a, a potent anaphylatoxin, is a candidate target molecule for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, RA, and the antiphospholipid syndrome. In contrast, up until now, no specific contribution of C5a and its receptor, C5aR, was recognized in diseases of antibody-dependent type II autoimmunity. Here we identify C5a as a novel key mediator of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and show that mice lacking C5aR are partially resistant to this IgG autoantibody-induced disease model. Upon administration of anti-erythrocyte antibodies, upregulation of activating Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaRs) on Kupffer cells, as observed in WT mice, was absent in C5aR-deficient mice, and FcgammaR-mediated in vivo erythrophagocytosis was impaired. Surprisingly, in mice deficient in FcgammaRI and FcgammaRIII, anti-erythrocyte antibody-induced C5 and C5a production was abolished, demonstrating the existence of a previously unidentified FcgammaR-mediated C5a-generating pathway. These results show that the development of a full-blown antibody-dependent autoimmune disease requires C5a--produced by and acting on FcgammaR--and may suggest therapeutic benefits of C5 and/or C5a/C5aR blockade in AIHA and other diseases closely related to type II autoimmune injury.
