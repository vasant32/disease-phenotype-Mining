Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is caused by thrombotic vascular occlusions that affect both small and large vessels, producing ischemia in the affected organs as well as a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). We report a case of a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who developed massive cerebral ischemia due to this entity. Prompt and aggressive treatment may prevent and actually resolve lethal complications caused by this devastating syndrome.
