AIM: To specify detectability and clinical presentation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in young and middle aged patients with phlebothromboses (PT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Enzyme immunoassays for lupus anticoagulant, PCR determination of G1691A mutation in the gene of coagulation factor V, mutation G20210A in prothrombin gene, mutation C677T in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene were made in 97 patients (57 males and 40 females) with venous thrombosis as well as estimation of external and internal coagulation, antithrombin III activity, protein C activity, plasma fibrinogen, stimulated platelet aggregation, blood and plasma viscosity. RESULTS: APS was detected in 20.6% young and middle-aged patients with venous thrombosis, in 18.5% of them--primary APS. In APS patients acquired risk factors of thrombosis occurred significantly less frequently than in patients with venous thrombosis free of APS (30 and 70%, respectively). Recurrent pulmonary artery thromboembolism (TEPA) prevailed in APS patients. In patients with combined hemostatic disturbances (APS+mutation) TEPA was diagnosed more frequently than in APS patients and in the absence of markers of genetic thrombophilia. Plasma viscosity is most important diagnostically among rheological indices.
