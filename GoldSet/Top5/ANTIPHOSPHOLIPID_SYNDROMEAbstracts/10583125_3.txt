The occurrence of erythema multiforme (EM) in patients with lupus erythematosus (LE) has been described previously as a coincidental association. In contrast, LE with EM-like lesions and a peculiar immunological pattern, including positive rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies and a serum antibody against an extract of human tissues recently recognized as similar to Ro (SSA), constitutes an established entity named Rowell's syndrome. We describe a woman with LE and long-standing widespread vesiculobullous and necrotic haemorrhagic EM-like lesions in combination with Ro (SSA) and scl-70 antibodies and the typical laboratory findings of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), namely lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. This case could conceivably be consistent with a diagnosis of Rowell's syndrome, if the latter is regarded as a clinicopathological spectrum. However, the coexistence of LE, persistent EM-like disease and incomplete APS may also fulfil the diagnostic criteria for the 'multiple autoimmune syndromes'. We speculate that the laboratory markers of APS play a pivotal part in such an unusual clinical presentation.
