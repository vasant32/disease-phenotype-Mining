Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), one of a group of antiphospholipid antibodies which include the lupus anticoagulant (LA), may occur in association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are less commonly detected in other diseases. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and immunological features of 39 consecutive patients with abnormal aCL identified by one laboratory, to examine the spectrum of neurological disease in those patients without SLE. Fourteen patients in this category are described, 6 of whom did not have evidence of LA. All but 1 presented with neurological symptoms. Stroke and migraine dominated the clinical presentation, but many patients had features to suggest the presence of a hypercoagulable state. This study lends support to the concept of a primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
