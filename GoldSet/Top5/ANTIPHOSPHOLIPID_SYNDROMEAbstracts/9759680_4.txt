Dermatologic manifestations are among the most common signs of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The Hopkins Lupus Cohort study is a prospective study in which patients with SLE are seen on a quarterly basis for measurement of disease activity, laboratory tests, and assessment of morbidity and quality of life. This cohort has allowed unique insights into the epidemiologic factors of SLE, the presentation of dermatologic lupus, and morbidity, all of which are presented in this report. In addition, the dermatologic signs of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) are reviewed. Approaches to treatment of dermatologic lupus and APS are discussed.
