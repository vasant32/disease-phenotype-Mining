 BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APAS) remain at high risk for the development of renal thrombosis without the benefit of anticoagulation therapy. This study examines the efficacy of anticoagulation therapy in this high-risk patient population. METHOD: Of nine APAS renal-transplant patients, seven were treated with coumadin, whereas two were treated with heparin. RESULTS: Of the two patients treated with heparin, one had early allograft loss, whereas the other patient is doing fine at 5 years posttransplant. Of the seven 7 patients treated with coumadin, two patients are doing well at 2 and 3 years posttransplant, two had early allograft loss, the remaining three patients returned to dialysis after they were taken off of the coumadin at 6, 12, and 20 months posttransplant because of bleeding complications. CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulation therapy is beneficial to some but not all APAS patients. In addition, bleeding complications are a serious side effect of this therapy.
