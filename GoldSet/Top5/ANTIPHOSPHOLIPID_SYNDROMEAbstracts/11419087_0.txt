Antibodies to beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta 2-GPI) and antibodies to cardiolipin (aCL) were determined by enzyme immunoassay in 58 patients with verified SLE. Elevated level of antibodies to beta 2-GPI was associated with development of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and aCL hyperproduction. It is evident that synthesis of antibodies to beta 2-GPI is an additional marker of APS in SLE.
