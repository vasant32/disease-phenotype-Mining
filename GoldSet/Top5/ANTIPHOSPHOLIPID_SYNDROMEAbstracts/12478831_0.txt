Antiphospholipid syndrome is a thrombotic disorder in which the clinical features are venous and/or arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent fetal loss. We describe the case of a 39-year-old woman affected by antiphospholipid syndrome and acute anterior myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. The patient, after the failure of thrombolysis, was successfully treated by rescue angioplasty. The persistent thrombocytopenia of these patients may lead to safety problems in thrombolytic treatment; therefore, primary angioplasty may be considered the treatment of choice.
