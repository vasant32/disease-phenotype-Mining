An 18 year old man presented with cough and dyspnoea caused by pulmonary infarction. A large friable mass of organising thrombus in an anatomically normal right ventricle was identified as an embolic source. The acute illness was associated with raised titres of anticardiolipin antibodies, one of the antiphospholipid group. This thrombus recurred after surgical removal but subsequently was dissipated after treatment with oral corticosteroids and long-term oral anticoagulation.
