OBJECTIVE: To assess plasmapheresis with low dose prednisone on obstetric and neonatal outcomes among unsuccessfully treated pregnant women with documented antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). METHODS: Eighteen pregnant women received prednisone (10 mg/day) and plasmapheresis at 7.08+/-0.6 weeks of gestation, for 3 sessions per week, until lupus anticoagulant activity suppressed and IgG anticardiolipin lowered. Serial pulsatility indexes (PI) of umbilical and uterine arteries were performed. RESULTS: The live birth rate was 100%; mild pre-eclampsia 5.5%; preterm deliveries 22.22%; intrauterine growth restriction 11.11%; thrombocytopenia 5.5%; oligohydramnios and fetal distress 16.6%. There were no perinatal deaths, thrombotic events or lupus flare. Uterine artery PI was reduced and umbilical artery PI was >95th percentile. CONCLUSION: Plasmapheresis and low dose prednisone were associated with a low rate of obstetric and neonatal complications. Plasmapheresis may be used to treat pregnant women with documented APS when first lines (aspirin and/or heparin) fail to prevent pregnancy loss.
