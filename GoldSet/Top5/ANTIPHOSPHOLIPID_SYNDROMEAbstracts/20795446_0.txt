This retrospective review of hospital records analysed pregnancy outcome with 2 different treatments for women with recurrent miscarriage diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome in the index pregnancy. Of 64 women, 29 had received aspirin and 35 aspirin plus heparin. Pregnancy-induced hypertension, prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction and neonatal death were considered as maternal and fetal complications. There were no significant differences in antenatal and maternal complications between the groups. HOwever, there were significant differences in mean anticardiolipin IgG antibody levels. Aspirin alone or in combination with parin was equally efficacious in women with antiphospholipid syndrome and recurrent miscarriage.
