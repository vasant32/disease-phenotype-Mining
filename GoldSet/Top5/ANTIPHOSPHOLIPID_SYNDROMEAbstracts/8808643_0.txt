Heparin and heparan sulfate are related glycosaminoglycans which demonstrate high-affinity interactions with a number of proteins, including antithrombin III. The immunogenicity of heparin has been reported previously employing heparin-protein conjugates as immunogens and as antigens in solid-phase assays. Previous studies also demonstrate that anti-heparin antibodies play a role in autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus and anti-phospholipid syndrome and in patients who receive heparin for therapeutic purposes. In the current study, we investigated the expression of monoclonal anti-heparin antibodies in nonimmunized, autoimmune MRL/lpr/lpr++ mice employing a liquid-phase radioimmunoassay. The Kd of monoclonal IgG2b autoantibodies for heparin was approximately 10(-8)M. Anti-heparin antibodies were precipitating, and were not polyreactive. The IgG monoclonal antibodies described in this study represent an immunological instance of a specific, high-affinity heparin-protein interaction.
