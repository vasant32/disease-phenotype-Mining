A retrospective analysis of clinicohematologic parameters of 25 patients with lupus anticoagulant was carried out. The hematologic tests included dilute Russel viper venom test (dRVVT), kaolin clotting time (KCT), activated partial thromboplastin time, and prothrombin time. The diagnosis of lupus anticoagulants was based on the presence of prolonged KCT/dRVVT, its absence of correction with normal plasma and correction by phospholipids. Specific factor assays and platelet aggregation studies were performed wherever required. Ten patients (40%) had thrombosis, which was venous in 5 (50%) and arterial in 4 (40%). One patient (10%) had both arterial and venous thrombosis and presented with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. Eighteen female patients conceived. Four (22%) of these had recurrent first trimester abortion. Five (20%) patients had bleeding manifestations. One (4%) of these had hypoprothrombinemia and was diagnosed to have hypoprothrombinemia lupus anticoagulant syndrome. However in two of these patients, no cause of bleeding could be identified other than the presence of lupus anticoagulants. It is concluded that patients with lupus anticoagulant have a varied spectrum of hemostatic disorders. Bleeding may sometimes occur in these patients due to associated thrombocytopenia or associated factor inhibitors. Rarely, it may occur due to presence of lupus anticoagulants alone.
