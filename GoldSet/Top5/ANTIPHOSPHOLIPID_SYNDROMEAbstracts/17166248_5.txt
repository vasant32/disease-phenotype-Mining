BACKGROUND: Routinely available coagulation assays are not capable of detecting clinically defined hypercoagulable states. A number of global coagulation assays have been developed with the potential to evaluate hypercoagulability, which predisposes to the common clinical events of arterial and venous thromboembolism (VTE). OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the overall hemostatic potential (OHP) assay would show abnormal fibrin generation and lysis in patients with clinically defined hypercoagulable states. METHODS: We used the OHP assay as described by Blomb√§ck and colleagues [1,2] in 161 clinically hypercoagulable patients with arterial or VTE, pregnancy complications or autoimmune disease. Eighty patients had associated antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA). Ninety-eight normal plasma donors were tested for comparison. RESULTS: We derived three new assay parameters for correlation with hypercoagulable states: the maximum optical density, maximum slope, and delay in onset of fibrin generation. We found significantly different assay results for all patients' parameters examined when compared with controls, indicating both increased fibrin generation and reduced fibrinolysis in hypercoagulable patients. The findings were similar whether samples were collected in association with an acute thrombotic event or not. Estimated assay sensitivity for detection of a clinically defined hypercoagulable state was 96%. CONCLUSIONS: The OHP assay is a simple, inexpensive global test that is useful for assessing patients with hypercoagulable states including APLA. OHP results are significantly abnormal in hypercoagulable groups compared with controls, indicating that both increased fibrin generation and reduced fibrinolysis contribute to hypercoagulable states. The assay may ultimately assist in tailoring clinical management to patients' individual requirements.
