Antiphospholipid antibodies, including lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, are increasingly recognized as a cause of neurological morbidity.

The cases of 7 patients who were referred for evaluation of behavior abnormalities and had antiphospholipid antibodies are presented, and the potential relationships of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome to behavioral alterations are discussed.
