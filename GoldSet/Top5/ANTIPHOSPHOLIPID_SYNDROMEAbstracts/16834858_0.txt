It is generally accepted that antiphospholipid syndrome remains a major medical problem characterised by hypercoagulability, arterial and venous thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. It is unclear how best to treat these patients should they require emergency surgery. If a lupus anticoagulant is present, hypercoagulability may occur de novo but surgical interventions along with sepsis are two important predisposing factors. We describe three patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome and discuss the implications for surgery.
