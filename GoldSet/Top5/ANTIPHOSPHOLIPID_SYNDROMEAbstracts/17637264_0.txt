 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical manifestations, treatment and prognosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). METHODS: The cases of 72 patients with defined APS admitted from Jan 1990 to Jan 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: 21 patients with primary APS and 51 patients with secondary APS were studied. Vascular thrombosis was present in 43 (59.7%) of the 72 patients in this study. Cardiac abnormalities could be observed in 48 patients (66.6%). Lesions most frequently involved left-sided valves, mitral (35.4%) more commonly affected than aortic (16.7%). Cardiac involvement was significantly related to thrombosis (P = 0.007) and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (P = 0.026). Valvular involvement was significantly related to brain infarcts (P = 0.008) and thrombosis (P = 0.029). 20 APS patients with cardiac abnormalities and thrombosis received anticoagulation therapy and thrombosis did not happen any more during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Cardiac manifestations of APS are valve abnormalities (valve thickening and vegetations), occlusive arterial disease (atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction), ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac abnormalities in APS are likely to be related to hypercoagulability.
