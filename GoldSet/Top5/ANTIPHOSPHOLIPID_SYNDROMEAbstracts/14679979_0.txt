Antiphospholipids including lupus anticoagulants (LA) and anticardiolipins (ACL) are known to be able to lead to many obstetricals complications like gravidic chorea, eclampsia and repeated spontaneous abortion. Our objective was to determine place of antiphospholipids among women presenting repeated spontaneous abortion in Senegal. We tested prospectively 96 women in a breeding age with a past history of at least 2 spontaneous abortion. 14.6% and 21.1% of tese women present present respectively LA and ACL. The prevalence of antiphospholipids in among women presenting repeated abortion is higher in Senegal and similar to those previously reported confirming its place in this pathology important. A strategy of diagnosis should be defined between obstetricians and biologists in order to improve the obstetrical prognosis.
