We report on a 13-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who exhibited symptoms of severe migraine and familial moyamoya disease. Cerebral magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed stenosis and occlusion of the bilateral internal carotid arteries associated with the development of collateral circulation (moyamoya vessels). In a child, as in this case, headaches with cerebral infarction associated with moyamoya disease are unusual. Few cases of SLE associated with familial moyamoya disease have been reported, with no previous reports of such cases from Korea. There were no evidences of antiphospholipid syndrome, and activity of SLE or other risk factors for cerebral occlusion were also absent.
