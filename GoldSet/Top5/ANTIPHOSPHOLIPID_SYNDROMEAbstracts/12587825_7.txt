Autoantibodies binding beta2-glycoprotein I (B2GPI) are an important finding in the antiphospholipid syndrome. While antibodies from mice or rabbits immunized with B2GPI readily bind B2GPI coated on a polystyrene microwell plate, anti-B2GPI autoantibodies only do so when using a modified microwell plate with a negatively charged surface. This study demonstrates that, for the detection of anti-B2GPI autoantibodies in an ELISA using modified plates, an antigen coating concentration threshold exists, such that minimal or no binding occurs below a certain coating concentration of antigen, even though antigen is easily demonstrable on the plate. This is consistent with the hypothesis that autoantibodies require divalent binding to B2GPI for detection, as sufficient antigen density for two protein molecules to be sufficiently close to enable divalent binding would only be expected to occur at higher coating concentrations. Several mutant forms of B2GPI developed for epitope determination experiments are shown to have decreased binding to microtitre plates compared to wild-type. If wild-type and mutants are assayed for antibody binding near the threshold a significant diminution in binding to mutants occurs that is the result of inadequate binding to the plate, but could be misinterpreted as the result of interruption of an epitope by the mutation.
