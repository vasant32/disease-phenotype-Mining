A fourteen-year-old right-handed male with a history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) presented with alternating hemichorea. Laboratory findings included elevated anticardiolipin IgG and anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein I IgG, which were consistent with primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging revealed altered striatal metabolism in his left putamen while he was exhibiting right-sided hemichorea. His symptoms resolved on prednisone; however, his antiphospholipid antibody profile remained markedly abnormal despite being symptom-free for 26 months.
