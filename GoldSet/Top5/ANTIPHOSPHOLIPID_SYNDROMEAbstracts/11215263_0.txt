We reported a 68-year-old man with anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome who presented slowly progressive pure motor monoparesis(PMM) in left upper extremity as a sign of cerebral infarction. He had history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He first noticed clumsiness in left fingers, then weakness of left fingers with drop hand developing gradually in 2 to 6 weeks. He began to feel difficulty in raising left upper arm in 8 weeks and was admitted to our hospital. On admission, he exhibited severe weakness in distal portion and moderate weakness in proximal portion of left upper extremity. Deep tendon reflexes were slightly hyperactive in left side. Muscle strength of right upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities were normal. There was no sensory and autonomic abnormality. Laboratory examination revealed high titer of anti-cardiolipin IgM antibody. Brain MRI demonstrated a small cortical infarction in the right precentral gyrus. Cerebral angiography revealed severe stenosis in right common carotid artery. Other examinations including EMG were unremarkable. PMM in left upper extremity was considered to be caused by the ischemic lesion in the precentral motor cortex. Slowly progressive course might be explained by the hypovolemic factor due to the marked stenosis in right common carotid artery, poor collateral circulation, and abnormal coagulation caused by anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome.
