This case report we presented aims to report a-31-year-old man with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) who developed myocardial infarction (MI) and also aims to discuss the possible mechanisms. The results showed that traditional risk factors alone do not cause coronary heart disease with SLE, and SLE-related factors influence the atherogenic process. We found that although SLE patients with acute MI benefit from percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) therapy, it is very important to choose the reasonable antithrombotic strategies in patients with SLE and APS undergoing PCI who require oral anticoagulant therapy.
