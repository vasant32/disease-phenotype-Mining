A 43-year-old man presented with oliguria and hypertension. Renal arteriography showed bilateral renal artery occlusion. Circulating antiphospholipid antibodies were found together with a change in natural anticoagulant plasma levels. Immunofluorescence of examined vessels showed immune complex vasculitis. We discuss the pathogenetic mechanism leading to the development of this rare occlusive event.
