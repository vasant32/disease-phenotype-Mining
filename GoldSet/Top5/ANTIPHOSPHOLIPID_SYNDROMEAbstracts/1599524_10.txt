OBJECTIVE: We report an unusual case of primary pulmonary hypertension and review the pertinent literature. METHODS: A 25-year-old Caucasian woman presented with progressive dyspnea and was found to have pulmonary hypertension. Antiphospholipid antibodies were present. The patient had a prolonged hospital course, was unresponsive to therapy, and died suddenly. RESULTS: Postmortem examination revealed a large thrombus affecting the right main pulmonary artery, with plexogenic arteriopathy bilaterally. CONCLUSION: This appears to be the first reported case of primary pulmonary hypertension complicated by thrombosis of a main pulmonary artery in association with antiphospholipid antibodies.
