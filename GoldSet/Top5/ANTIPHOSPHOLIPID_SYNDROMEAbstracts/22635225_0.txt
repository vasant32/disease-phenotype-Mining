In this review preliminary data on the follow-up of 141 babies born to mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome are reported. In spite of maternal treatment, the rate of both preterm delivery and low birth weight were 16 and 17%, respectively. At birth, no clinical evidence of perinatal thrombosis was observed. Placental transfer of antiphospholipid antibodies occurred in 20, 25 and 43% of cases for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin and anti-Î²2-glycoprotein I antibodies, respectively. At 24 months of follow-up, four children showed behaviour abnormalities suggesting the possible need for long-term neurological evaluation in this clinical setting.
