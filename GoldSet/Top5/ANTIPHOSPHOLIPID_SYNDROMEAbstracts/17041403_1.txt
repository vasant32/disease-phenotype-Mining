We describe four patients with widespread cutaneous necrosis as a manifestation of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. In three of the patients, the lesions were the first manifestation of the syndrome, and they were located in upper and lower extremities. Vascular thrombosis was present in the skin biopsy in all of the patients. Patients were effectively treated with anticoagulants, and healing occurred within 60 days. Such widespread cutaneous necrosis is a rare manifestation of the syndrome, and it must be regarded as major thrombotic event. Long-term treatment with anticoagulants must be considered. The recognition of these lesions is important, because they may be the onset of the syndrome, allowing its early diagnosis and treatment.
