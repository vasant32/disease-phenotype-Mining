The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and to evaluate clinical significance of anticardiolipin antibodies in cohort of 60 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The measurement of autoantibodies was carried out by standardized ELISA method using MELISA anticardiolipin IgG and IgM kits (Walker Diagnostics, Cambridgeshire, UK) A positive result indicated a value in GPL or MPL U/ml more than 3 SD above the mean value obtained with control sera of 48 healthy pearsons. IgG isotype alone, and both isotupe of anticardiolipin antibodies were found in 30 percent, in 6,7 percent and in 11,7 percent of patients, respectively. High or medium levels of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were found in all 6 patients with actual venous or arterial thrombosis, but in only 3 out of 10 patients with history of thromboembolic features. All 6 patients with actual thrombocytopenia and 3 female with recent spontaneus abortion also had elevated levels of the same isotype. Total anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM) were significantly associated with recent or history of thrombocytopenia. In conclusion, we emphasize the association of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies with recent events of antiphospholipid syndrome in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
