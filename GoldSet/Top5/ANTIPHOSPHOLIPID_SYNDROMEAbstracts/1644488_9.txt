Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) frequently appear in patients with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and have also been detected in infections, neoplasia, the primary antiphospholipid syndrome, in association with certain medications and also in subjects without apparent disease. Recently, anticardiolipin antibodies have been described in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Eighty-four human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients were studied to assess the influence of risk factors for HIV infection and of the stage of HIV-1 infection on the prevalence of IgG-ACA in HIV-seropositive patients. Patients were divided in two groups, one composed of 38 asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals and the other of 46 AIDS patients. A control group of 42 healthy HIV-negative blood donors was also studied. All subjects of the control group were IgG-ACA-negative. Of the 84 HIV-positive patients, 50 were IgG-ACA positive (59.5%) and 34 IgG-ACA negative (40.5%). None of the HIV-positive patients presented any thromboembolic phenomena. No significant differences were found with respect to sex, risk factors and stage of disease when the presence of IgG-ACA in HIV-positive patients was considered. ACA does not appear to be a pronostic marker in HIV-1-infected subjects. The presence of IgG-ACA is probably related to HIV-1-infection itself, and is indicative of impaired humoral immunity in these patients.
