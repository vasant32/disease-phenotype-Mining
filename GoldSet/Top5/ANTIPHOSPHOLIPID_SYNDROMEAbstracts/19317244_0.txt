The main clinical features of primary antiphospholipid syndrome are recurrent foetal loss, arterial or venous thrombosis and thrombocytopaenia. Evan's syndrome is characterized by simultaneous or sequential association of autoimmune anaemia and thombocytopaenia, rarely reported in primary antiphospholipid syndrome. We describe 2 cases of this association. Treatment with steroids was started in both cases, the follow-up was marked by the normalization of haemoglobin value and platelet count, without relapse.
