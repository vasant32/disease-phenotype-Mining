 OBJECTIVE: To describe morbidity, organ damage, mortality, and cause of death in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). METHODS: Descriptive analysis of 135 patients. Patients were clustered according to initial event: arterial thrombosis including stroke (AT; n = 46), venous thrombosis including pulmonary emboli (VT; n = 53), or pregnancy morbidity (PM; n = 36). Disease progression according to initial event and prevalence of organ damage was observed. RESULTS: APS occurs among young individuals (mean age 33.3 Â± 11.9 yrs). One-third of the patients have APS secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or SLE-like disease. A broad spectrum of clinical manifestations mark the disease onset even before diagnosis. The pattern of initial presentation is preserved with regard to second event; VT is followed by VT (84%), AT is followed by AT (95%), and PM is followed by PM (88.9%). The highest morbidity is attributed to neurologic damage. PM is more likely to be followed by a second event, yet is associated with less organ damage than AT and VT. After a mean followup of 7.55 years, 29% of patients experienced organ damage and 5 died, with Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics score associated with increased mortality (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07-1.60, p = 0.01, per 1-unit increase); hematological malignancies occurred in 2 patients after a cumulative followup of 1020 person-years. Coexistent SLE adds significant damage in patients with APS. CONCLUSION: APS is a disease of young individuals, who experience increased morbidity. Neurologic damage is the most common cause of morbidity. AT at presentation as well as coexistent SLE are associated with poor outcome.
