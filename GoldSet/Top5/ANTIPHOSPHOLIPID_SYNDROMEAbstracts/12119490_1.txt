Diseases affecting both the lung and the kidney have grave prognosis and serious diagnostic and therapeutic consequences. Here, 3 cases of pulmonary-renal syndrome caused by antiphospholipid syndrome are reported. The patients presented with dyspnea, renal insufficiency, pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray and areas of ground glass attenuation on computed tomography of the lungs. There were no signs of infectious disease, vasculitis or myocardial insufficiency. Clinical findings, antiphospholipid levels and histological findings in transbronchial and/or renal biopsy proved the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. Antiphospholipid syndrome is a comparatively rare disorder which is relevant in the differential diagnosis of diseases affecting both lung and kidney and requires specific therapeutic measures.
