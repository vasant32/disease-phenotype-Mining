OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk factors associated with renal vein thrombosis (RVT) in Chinese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Data on clinical symptoms, renal biopsy, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome profile, and serological examinations of lupus features were examined retrospectively in six patients with RVT confirmed by angiography from a total of 625 patients with SLE over a 14 year period (1982-1996). RESULTS: The lupus patients with RVT did not have acute symptoms of severe flank pain, haematuria, and oligouria. In contrast, most patients were suspected to have RVT because of peripheral oedema and worsening proteinuria. Roentgenological examinations (including renal sonography, renal computer tomography, or renal Doppler, or all three) were positive only in some patients. Positive antiphospholipid antibody profiles were found in four of six lupus patients. By renal biopsy, only two samples were confirmed as World Health Organisation (WHO) class V lupus membranous glomerulonephritis. The others were class IV in three patients, and class III in the remaining one. No RVT was found in lupus patients without nephrotic syndrome. Peripheral thrombophlebitis was, however, noted in only one patient. CONCLUSION: Nephrotic syndrome could be a distinct risk factor in the development of RVT in Chinese SLE patients, in contrast with that reported in white populations in whom the peripheral thrombotic events were recognised as a determining factor.
