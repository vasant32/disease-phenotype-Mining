Although the precise nature of Antiphospholipid antibodies is still not clearly defined, they are known to have association with thromboembolic events and have been found in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Moreover, high prevalence of HCV infection and thrombotic risk is described in thalassemia. We aimed at investigating the prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCLAbs), lupus anticoagulant (LA), and their relation with HCV infection in Iranian thalassemic patients. Presence of anti-HCV antibody, serum HCV-RNA, aCLAbs, and LA activity was determined in 131 patients with thalassemia major (male/female: 63/68 aged 3-29 years) registered at thalassemia unit, Dastgheib Hospital, Shiraz, Iran. Sixty-one healthy controls were also included. Anti-HCV antibody was positive in 24 (18.3%), IgG aCLAbs in 56 (42.7%), and LA activity in 9 (6.9%) patients. 87.5% of patients positive for aCLAbs had a low titer of aCLAbs. Although none of the participants had a previous history of thrombosis, higher prevalence of aCLAbs was detected in thalassemic patients compared with controls. No significant difference in the prevalence of aCLAbs was found between HCV-infected and noninfected patients. A high prevalence of aCLAbs, the majority in low titers, was detected in Iranian thalassemic patients irrespective of previous history of thrombosis and presence of HCV infection.
