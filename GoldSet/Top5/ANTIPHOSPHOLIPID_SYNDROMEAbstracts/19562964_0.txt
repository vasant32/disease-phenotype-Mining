 BACKGROUND: The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APA), especially anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), antibodies against beta2-glikoprotein I and lupus anticoagulant leads to thrombotic disorders. The pathogenetic role of APA in children is not exactly explained. The frequency of occurrence of APA and antiphospholipid syndrom in children is 2 to 3 times lower than in adults. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to indicate the presence of ACA in circulating immunological complexes (CIC) from sera of patients suffering from juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 31 sera were investigated, 16 from JIA patients and 15 from JSLE patients. The free ACA IgG class, ACA bound in CIC were estimated by the ELISA method (after dissociation of CIC and y-fraction paecipitation). RESULTS: In CIC isolated from sera of JIA and JSLE patients ACA were discovered. ACA, possessing high avidity, in CIC were more frequently discovered than unbound ACA (38.7% vs. 25.8%). CONCLUSIONS: ACA in CIC were more frequent in sera of JIA patients, unbound ACA were more frequent in sera of JSLE patients.
