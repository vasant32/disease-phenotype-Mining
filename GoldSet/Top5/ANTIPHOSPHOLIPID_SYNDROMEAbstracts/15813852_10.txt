Interference of anti-phospholipid antibodies with the protein C pathway has been suggested to play a role in the development of thrombosis in the anti-phospholipid syndrome. We studied the effect of IgG preparations containing anti-prothrombin antibodies of 17 lupus anticoagulant-positive patients and 12 controls on the inactivation of factor Va (FVa) by activated protein C (APC) in a system with purified coagulation factors. Test IgG was incubated with human prothrombin, phospholipid vesicles and CaCl(2). Protein S, FVa and APC were added and the APC-dependent loss of FVa activity was monitored over time. The residual amount of FVa remaining after 10 min was 14 +/- 4% (mean +/- SD) when 1.5 mg/ml normal IgG was present and ranged between 17% and 82% with 1.5 mg/ml patient IgG. Twelve patients IgG gave values of residual FVa >22% (i.e. 2 SD above the mean of controls), indicating that APC-mediated inactivation of FVa was significantly inhibited. The inhibition was strictly dependent on the presence of prothrombin, proportional to the concentration of IgG and strongly diminished at a 20-fold higher phospholipid concentration. Most, although not all, IgG containing anti-prothrombin antibodies inhibit the APC-catalysed FVa inactivation, which may contribute to the increased risk of thrombosis in patients with the anti-phospholipid syndrome.
