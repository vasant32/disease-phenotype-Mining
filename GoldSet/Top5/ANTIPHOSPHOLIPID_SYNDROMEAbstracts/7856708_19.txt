OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study the influence of intravenous immunoglobulin on pregnancy outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnancy outcomes were evaluated in five patients with 17 unsuccessful previous pregnancies. Each patient received 400 mg/kg immunoglobulin for 5 days monthly beginning in the first or early second trimester. Four patients with previous thromboembolic events were treated with concomitant heparin prophylaxis. Four patients received 81 mg of aspirin daily. RESULTS: Short- and long-term decreases of anticardiolipin immunoglobulin G were noted in three patients. Four patients were delivered of healthy infants at term, one at 32 weeks' gestation with a diagnosis of fetal distress. Neither preeclampsia nor fetal intrauterine growth retardation were observed. The immunoglobulin therapy was not associated with major side effects. Significant placental histologic anomalies were not identified. CONCLUSIONS: The observations suggest that immunoglobulin therapy may improve pregnancy outcomes beyond that observed with heparin and aspirin. A prospective trial is encouraged.
