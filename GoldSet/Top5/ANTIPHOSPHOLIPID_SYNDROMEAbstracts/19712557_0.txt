The aim of this retrospective, observational study was to determine the impact of low-dose enoxaparin (20 mg) in conjunction with low-dose aspirin on the pregnancy outcome of women with antiphospholipid syndrome and recurrent miscarriage. The study was conducted in a tertiary referral teaching hospital. A total of 35 women with antiphospholipid syndrome were treated with low-dose enoxaparin and aspirin as soon as pregnancy was confirmed. The outcome of pregnancy was analysed. The miscarriage rate was 7/35 (20%) whereas the live birth rate was 28/35 (80%). In conclusion, low-dose (20 mg) enoxaparin in conjunction with low-dose aspirin treatment produced encouraging results. The findings in this study suggest that there is a case for randomized controlled trials to compare low-dose (20 mg) enoxaparin with higher doses.
