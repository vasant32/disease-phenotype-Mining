A 47-year-old woman with antiphospholipid syndrome was referred to us for hemostatic control at the time of extraction of teeth. After administration of intravenous gammaglobulin of 0.4g/kg daily for 5 days, lupus anticoagulant activity disappeared and platelet count slightly increased. Furthermore, she had a transfusion of platelet-rich plasma before operation and no hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications occurred. These findings suggest that gammaglobulin infusion therapy is useful in preventing the complications at operation in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.
