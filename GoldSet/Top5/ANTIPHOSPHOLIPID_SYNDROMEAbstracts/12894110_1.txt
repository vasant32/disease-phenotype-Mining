We describe a female patient with an acute purpuric and bullous eruption mainly affecting the lower aspect of the legs. Skin biopsy specimens demonstrated microvascular occlusions with fibrin thrombi but no dermal inflammation. Intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia and transient antiphospholipid antibodies were evidenced as factors of thrombophilia. The responsibility of the latter in the onset of the cutaneous lesions is discussed.
