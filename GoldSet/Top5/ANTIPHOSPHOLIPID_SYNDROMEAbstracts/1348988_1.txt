Twenty patients with eclampsia were studied for the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies by the standard microflocculation test (quantitative) used in the VDRL. Four out of 20 patients (20%) were positive for anticardiolipin antibodies. Anticardiolipin antibodies which are antiphospholipid antibodies by decreasing the prostacyclin production may damage the vascular endothelium and cause thrombosis in the vessels. Hence, the presence of anticardiolipin antibody in eclampsia may have association with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome described by Harris et al. (Lancet ii: 1211, 1983) and its central nervous system sequelae.
