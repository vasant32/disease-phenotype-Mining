 OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and of vascular diseases increases with age, and aCL may be associated with various diseases in the elderly. So the significance of aCL in the elderly remains difficult to determine. We sought to determine the significance of persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the elderly. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the files of 327 patients [149 patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS); 64 patients age >or= 65 yrs] with 2 positive aPL [lupus anticoagulant (LAC) and/or aCL]. RESULTS: The frequency of APS was 40.8% (n = 134) in our 263 young patients (< 65 yrs) and 23.4% (n = 15) in our 64 elderly patients (>or= 65 yrs). The clinical characteristics of patients with persistent aPL were the same in those under and over 65 years. LAC was positive in all but one elderly patient with APS, and occurred in this group more frequently than in the young patients (93.3% vs 44.6%; p < 0.006). The presence of LAC allowed to discriminate APS patients in our elderly population (93.3% in APS vs 48.9% in non-APS patients; p < 0.009). CONCLUSION: Interpretation of a positive determination of APL is difficult in the elderly; persistent LAC may be the most valuable biological marker of APS in the elderly.
