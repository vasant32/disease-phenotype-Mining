We present a patient with membranous glomerulonephritis, several clinical complications of the antiphospholipid syndrome and ulcerative colitis, but without lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid/cofactor antibodies. Immunological studies--other antibodies--were negative and failed to show enough criteria for any autoimmune diseases. Evaluation of her laboratory tests for hereditary thrombophilia revealed a heterozygous form of the Leiden mutation that might be associated with widespread vasculopathy. An interesting possibility is that the inherited activated protein C resistance could be an additional risk factor for vaso-occlusive manifestations appearing as a clinical sign of cardiovascular diseases and nephropathy.
