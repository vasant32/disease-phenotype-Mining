The objective of this study is to document a series of cases of occupationally derived autoimmune disease. Individuals with occupational exposure to acrylamides were evaluated clinically and biochemically/immunologically for evidence of autoimmune disease. Symptoms and signs and immuno-reactivity were monitored during exposure-free and re-exposure as part of the individuals' clinical evaluation. Six individuals with occupational acrylamide exposure had clinical and laboratory alterations characteristic of drug-induced autoimmune disease, specifically lupus, anti-phospholipid syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, and polymyositis. The similarity of the full spectrum of disease in the reported patients to that found with procainamide strongly suggests the effects of occupational exposure. This uncontrolled study suggests the need for a full epidemiologic analysis of all individuals working with such occupational exposure, including full clinical and immunological examination.
