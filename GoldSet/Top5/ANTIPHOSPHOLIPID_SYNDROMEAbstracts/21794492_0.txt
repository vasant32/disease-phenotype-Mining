Intraspinal hemorrhage is very rare and intramedullary hemorrhage, also called "hematomyelia," is the rarest form of intraspinal hemorrhage. There are few reports in medical literature. We report the case of a woman of 43 years with diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome under anticoagulant therapy that presented hematomyelia. We describe the clinical course, the findings in the image studies and surgery, and the available information in the literature.
