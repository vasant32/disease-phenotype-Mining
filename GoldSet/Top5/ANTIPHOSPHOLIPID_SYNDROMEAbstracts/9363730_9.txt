This study was conducted to determine whether drugs used for conventional treatments of pregnant women with antiphosholipid syndrome might be able to restore the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced secretion of placental human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) in vitro. We tested this hypothesis using a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an in-vitro placental culture system. Pharmacological dose of low molecular weight heparin (20 IU/ml) significantly (P < 0.02) reduced the antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) binding in the ELISA and was able to restore GnRH-induced HCG secretion (P < 0.05) in presence of aPL-containing sera. Low-dose aspirin (0.03 M) did not modify aPL binding in the ELISA, but partially restored HCG secretion (P < 0.05). These observations may help to explain the role of these treatments in antiphospholipid syndrome.
