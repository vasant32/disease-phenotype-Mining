The post-mortem neuropathological investigations were carried out on 20 female New Zealand rabbits. Two main types of changes were found: inflammatory, including meningeal and perivascular infiltrates, and thrombotic within the nervous tissue. The findings revealed that active process within the CNS persists at least 3 months after APS was evoked, however its intensity, especially necrotic changes and vessel wall thickening evidently diminish. The active APS after experiment had been finished was also confirmed in blood samples.
