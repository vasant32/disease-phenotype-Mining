Patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) have poor prognosis, and pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is considered the treatment of choice for this condition. We report a case and review the literature of successful PEA for CTEPH due to antiphospholipid syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. The definitive and decisive approach needed to treat this high-risk patient with a history of comorbidity, long-term illness and poor compliance was found with a therapy of PEA.
