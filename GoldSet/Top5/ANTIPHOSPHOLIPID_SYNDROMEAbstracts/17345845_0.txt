The paper presents diagnostic problems and therapeutic management in a case of 34 year old woman with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) connected with overlap syndrome: autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Life threatening cardiac arrhythmia was the first clinical manifestation of the disease. Pulmonary embolism occurred a few months later, with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The diagnosis of AlH and PBC was made as a result of further research of complex immunological disturbances observed in the patient and after liver biopsy.
