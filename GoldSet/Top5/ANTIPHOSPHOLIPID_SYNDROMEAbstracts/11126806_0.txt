INTRODUCTION: The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APA) is a potentially life-threatening disease in pregnancy, associated with spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), preeclampsia and foetal death in utero. One of the sequelae of the antiphospholipid-antibodies is an impaired uteroplacental circulation. We present a case where we diagnosed an antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APA) on the basis of a highly pathological Doppler flow in both uterine arteries. CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old G2P0 with a history of intrauterine foetal death in the 24th week was seen at 15 weeks in her second pregnancy for an ultrasound scan. The Doppler study of both uterine arteries showed highly pathological resistance indices and bilateral notching. Laboratory studies revealed elevated levels of antibodies against Cardiolipin and phospholipids. Therapy trials with low-dose aspirin, heparin, corticosteroids, hemodilution therapy and immunoglobulin remained unsuccessful. The foetus developed severe IUGR, anhydramnios and foetal distress. In the 26th week the parents insisted on a caesarean section because of a pathological heart rate pattern. The birth weight was 365 grams and the infant died immediately. DISCUSSION: There are several mechanisms which impair the uteroplacental circulation in an APA syndrome. Therefore it is essential to perform laboratory tests when detecting a pathological blood flow in both uterine arteries. In this case all therapies failed, and the preterm infant died due to severe IUGR and distress. The diagnosis, however, facilitated the introduction of early anticoagulation therapy for the mother, the exclusion of systemic lupus erythematodes and the counselling of the parents with regard to further pregnancies.
