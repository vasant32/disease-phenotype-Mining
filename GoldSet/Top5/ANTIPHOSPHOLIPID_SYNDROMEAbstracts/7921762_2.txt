The spectrum of the primary antiphospholipid syndrome has expanded in recent years. It has been associated with a number of non-thrombotic syndromes such as pulmonary hypertension, adrenal insufficiency, chorea and avascular necrosis of bone. Yet, it has not been described in association with inflammatory pulmonary disease. We describe a young male with definite primary antiphospholipid syndrome who developed insidious diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. The histopathologic examination of the involved lung demonstrated alveolitis and fibrosis. We suggest that this pulmonary involvement may represent another manifestation of the primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
