The case of a patient with basal ganglia infarction associated with primary human herpesvirus-6 infection is reported. Anticardiolipin antibody immunoglobulin G was elevated after human herpesvirus-6 infection and then decreased gradually. The transient elevation in the antiphospholipid antibody level suggests that the human herpesvirus-6 infection can induce antiphospholipid syndrome, thus resulting in a cerebral infarction.
