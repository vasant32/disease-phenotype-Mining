This article presents a case of a 17-year-old girl with primary antiphospholipid syndrome developing subacute signs of hand and leg ischaemia caused by radiologically verified radial and popliteal artery occlusion. She is successfully treated with a thrombolytic agent (alteplase) and recovers completely. Her laboratory results came positive for all three subtypes of antiphospholipid antibodies. This kind of antiphospholipid syndrome presentation is a very rare entity in itself. Shortly afterwards her mother is diagnosed with primary antiphospholipid syndrome as well. A familial form of antiphospholipid syndrome is suspected. Combination of a familial antiphospholipid syndrome presenting as bivessel arterial thrombosis is a unique case, to the best of our knowledge, never described in the literature before.
