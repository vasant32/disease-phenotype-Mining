Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is characterized by the association of recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis or recurrent fetal wastage and the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies, detected as anticardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant. The authors report an 8-year-old girl, who presented with central retinal artery occlusion and live do reticularis and was diagnosed as APS. Despite the proper anticoagulant treatment she had several cerebral ischemic events and died 29 months after the diagnosis. A larger number of pediatric case investigations will be required for better understanding and treating this rare thrombotic disorder.
