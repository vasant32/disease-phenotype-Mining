Acute myocardial infarction is relatively uncommon in patients under the age of 40 years. Unlike the older patients where rupture of coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque is the main underlying pathology, the pathogenesis in younger patients can be varied and may require different diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Hypercoagulable state associated with nephrotic syndrome and antiphospholipid syndrome can lead to the development of occlusive coronary artery thrombus in absence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Acute myocardial infarction in such a setting can sometimes be the first manifestation of an underlying disease. We describe a case of myocardial infarction in a young man with both nephrotic and antiphospho-lipid syndromes and present a brief literature review.
