We report a rare case of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in a 43-year-old man presenting as recurrent acute coronary stent thrombosis and complicated by three myocardial infarctions. As illustrated in this report, in APS patients recurrent life-threatening arterial thrombotic events may occur in spite of recommended anticoagulant therapy. We conclude that the APS should be considered as a potential cause of acute coronary syndrome, particularly in young individuals with a history of recurrent thrombotic events and/or with abnormal coagulation test results. Further studies are needed to determine the best therapeutic strategy for APS patients with acute coronary syndrome.
