We report a case of a 69-year-old woman with mycosis fungoides (MF), who presented with clinical and histological features of cutaneous lupus, and for 6 years was treated for this, until repeated biopsies and gene-rearrangement studies confirmed a diagnosis of MF. In addition, she developed thromboemboli and was found to have lupus anticoagulant antibodies. The possible biological relationship between antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and MF is considered. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of MF masquerading as cutaneous lupus.
