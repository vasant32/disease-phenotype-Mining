 BACKGROUND: Antiphospholipid syndrome is important as a cause of ischemic stroke, although clinical characteristics of the syndrome are not well documented. METHODS: We analyzed differences in clinical characteristics between 40 antiphospholipid-antibody (aPL)-positive and 40 aPL-negative stroke patients. RESULTS: Stroke patients with aPL were significantly younger and were more likely to be women in comparison with stroke patients without aPL. Valvular heart disease, neurological complications and hematological disorders were more frequent in the aPL-positive group. The mean value of thrombin-antithrombin III complex was significantly lower in the aPL-positive group. Cerebral infarctions in the carotid system were less and large-artery lesions more frequent in the aPL-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke patients with aPL have clinical characteristics distinct from stroke patients without aPL.
