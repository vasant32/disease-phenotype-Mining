 OBJECTIVE: To determine the polymorphism at position 247 of the beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) gene in Mexican patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and to compare these data in patients with or without antibodies to beta(2)GPI and with the clinical manifestations of APS. METHODS: We studied 39 patients with primary APS and compared them with 106 clinically healthy subjects. Polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The presence of "true" anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies, beta(2)GPI-dependent aCL antibodies (IgG and IgM), and phospholipid-free anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies (IgG isotype) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing nonirradiated ELISA plates. Clinical manifestations associated with antiphospholipid antibodies were also evaluated. RESULTS: We found no significant differences in the genotype expression between the control group and the primary APS patients (13% with VV, 52% with VL, and 35% with LL versus 23% with VV, 51% with VL, and 26% with LL, respectively). In contrast, anti-beta(2)GPI-positive patients had significantly higher frequencies of the VV genotype and V allele expression than the control subjects and the anti-beta(2)GPI-negative patients. These genotype and allele frequencies were also significantly higher in patients with arterial thrombosis than in patients without it. Anti-beta(2)GPI-negative patients without arterial thrombosis did not express the VV genotype. We found no differences in the Val/Leu(247) polymorphism of the beta(2)GPI gene in primary APS patients with or without "true" aCL antibodies or in primary APS patients with or without beta(2)GPI-dependent aCL antibodies. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the VV genotype at position 247 of the beta(2)GPI gene may play a role in the generation of anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies and perhaps in the expression of arterial thrombosis in primary APS.
