The Catastrophic Anti-phospholipid Syndrome (CAPS) is a rare acute clinical syndrome associated with serum anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL). It is rarely preceded by a precipitating event. It may occur as a primary event or be associated with auto-immune diseases. We report a fatal case occurring post-endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) in a patient with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), positive lupus anticoagulant and negative IgG with positive IgM anti-cardiolipin titres. The diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties of such cases is addressed.
