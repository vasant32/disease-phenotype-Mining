Thrombohemorrhagic balance is maintained by complicated interactions between the coagulation and fibrinolytic system, platelets, and the vessel wall. Dr. Virchow provided approach for investigating and managing thrombotic disorders. He proposed stasis, vascular injury, and hypercoagulability as causes for thrombosis. In 1965, antithrombin deficiency was described. After two decades, protein C and protein S deficiencies, mutations of factor V Leiden, and factor II were described. If we distinguish patients at high risk and low risk of thrombosis, we can optimize therapeutic decisions. There is currently no evidence to say that laboratory abnormality should influence intensity of anticoagulation. In this article we reviewed the risk factors and need for thrombophilia screening in patients. Screening general population for thrombophilia is not justified or recommended at this time.
