INTRODUCTION: We conducted a prospective study to determine the prevalence and the prognosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in patients with retinal venous occlusion (RVO). PATIENTS: Consecutive patients presenting with retinal vein occlusion were screened for vascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) and for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL): anticardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-glycoprotein I, and lupus anticoagulant. Patients with a serum sample positive for aPL returned at least 6 weeks later for a new screening to determine the prevalence of antiphospholipid syndrome. All patients were followed to determine the outcome. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients presented with RVO, 16 had vascular risk factors for RVO. After two screenings for aPL, nine cases of antiphospholipid syndrome associated with RVO were diagnosed (13.2%). Eight patients were over age 50 years and none had a previous thrombotic event before RVO. All patients were treated with aspirin (160 mg/day). With a mean follow-up of 26.1+/-8.2 months (range, 16-36 months), there were no recurrences. CONCLUSION: Retinal venous occlusion is multifactorial in origin. In patients aged 50 years and older, without previous thrombotic event, aPL might not be predictive of recurrences and treatment with aspirin might be sufficient. In such patients, the routine screening for aPL does not appear warranted, but a randomized study should be conducted to really ascertain the pathogenic role of aPL and the most appropriate treatment in RVO.
