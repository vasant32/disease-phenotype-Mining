Because of importance of early diagnosis of antiphospholypid syndrome (APS) we present two case histories from clinical practice of Scientific-Practical Center of Rheumatology. The first clinical case (male, born in 1961, diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus and secondary APS) shows that verification of diagnosis in men is much harder than in women. The patient was diagnosed with secondary APS only 8 years after the onset of the disease. The second clinical case (female, born 1959, diagnosed with primary APS) is interesting because during many years the patient was diagnosed with SLE and secondary APS. We performed careful analysis of the case and made the diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Nowadays the patient is given an adequate treatment and his health is stable, but the risk of recurrent thrombosis still remains. Presented case histories show the variety of clinical symptoms and the complexity of diagnosis of APS.
