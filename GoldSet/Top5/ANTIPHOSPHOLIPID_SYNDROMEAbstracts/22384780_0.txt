A rare clinical case of intraplacental intervillous hemorrhage (Kline's hemorrhage) is presented. After delivery of a premature newborn (810 g/35 cm) in 27th week of uncomplicated pregnancy, peripartum observation of the premature placenta (270 g, 16 x 16 x 1.8) suggested multiple intraplacental cavernae with semifluid blood and fresh coagula and fresh marginal (partial) placental abruption. The possible etiologic causes of recent microembolism include thrombophilia, microangiopathy diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and severe preeclampsia.
