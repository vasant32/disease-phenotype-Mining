 OBJECTIVES: To compare the serum concentrations of the selected cytokines from subsequent trimesters of antiphospholipid syndrome complicated pregnancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 43 pregnant women (23 patients diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and 20 controls). IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, INF-gamma, TNF-alpha, and class I sHLA concentrations were analyzed by ELISA in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester RESULTS: INF-gamma levels were below the method detection threshold and therefore were not included in the final analysis. No significant changes in IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and class I sHLA concentrations were observed in subsequent trimesters in the group of women with antiphospholipid syndrome. Significant decrease in IL-10 in the 2nd trimester along with significant increase in TNF-alpha in the 3rd trimester were noted amongst the control subjects. The only significant inter-group difference was observed in the 1st trimester when mean TNF-alpha level was significantly higher among antiphospholipid syndrome women if compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The observed lack of significant differences between antiphospholipid syndrome affected and control group pregnancies in their sHLA class I and cytokine concentrations may be related to the fact that the treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome was implemented early and continued throughout all trimesters of the pregnancy.
