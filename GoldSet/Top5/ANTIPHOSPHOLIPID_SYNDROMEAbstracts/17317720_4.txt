BACKGROUND: Little is known on the actual diagnostic and therapeutic management of recurrent miscarriage and the impact of introducing guidelines on this topic. The objective of this study was to evaluate any changes in the management of recurrent miscarriage among Dutch gynaecologists after the introduction of the Dutch guideline 'Recurrent Miscarriage' in 1999. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to all practices for obstetrics and gynaecology in the Netherlands. Data concerned definition, diagnosis and treatment of recurrent miscarriage. Results were compared with a similar study conducted before the introduction of the guideline and with the recommendations in the guideline. RESULTS: The response rate was 83%. Regarding gestational age, only 3% of the respondents used the definition as advised in the guideline. After the introduction of the guideline, thrombophilia factors were tested more frequently, anticoagulants were prescribed more frequently and more respondents reported to correct uterine malformations. Therapies not described in the guideline, e.g. donor insemination and oocyte donation, were still applied. CONCLUSIONS: The adherence to the Dutch guideline 'Recurrent Miscarriage' was rather poor, presumably due to guideline-related as well as physician-related barriers. Too many diagnostic tests and ineffective therapeutic interventions were performed. This study demonstrates the importance of appropriate implementation and revision.
