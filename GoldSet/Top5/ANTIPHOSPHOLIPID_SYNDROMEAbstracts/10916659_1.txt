The authors report a case of a 48 year old woman admitted to hospital because of digital ischemia, in a context of antiphospholipid syndrome. The electrocardiogram-triggered electron beam computed tomography revealed an apical thrombus associated with a thinning left ventricular wall, suggesting painless myocardial infarction. The diagnosis was secondary confirmed by coronarography.
