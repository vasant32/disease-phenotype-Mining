The syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) is estimated to occur in 0.01-0.2% of pregnancies and is considered a severe form of preeclampsia. It is associated with considerable risk of maternal and foetal mortality. HELLP syndrome associated with antiphospholipid syndrome is known to occur early in the pregnancy. We report a case of severe HELLP syndrome complicated by multiple hepatic infarctions and portal vein thrombosis in the second trimester in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome.
