Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune prothrombotic disorder associated with autoantibodies to phospholipid (PL)-binding proteins, such as beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI). We have recently reported that binding of beta(2)GPI to anionic PL facilitates processing and presentation of the cryptic beta(2)GPI epitope that activates pathogenic autoreactive T cells. To clarify mechanisms that induce sustained presentation of the dominant antigenic beta(2)GPI determinant in patients with APS, T-cell proliferation induced by beta(2)GPI-treated phosphatidylserine liposome (beta(2)GPI/PS) was evaluated in bulk peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures. T cells from patients with APS responded to beta(2)GPI/PS in the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies derived from APS plasma, and this response was completely inhibited either by the depletion of monocytes or by the addition of anti-FcgammaRI antibody. These findings indicate that efficient presentation of the cryptic determinants can be achieved by monocytes undergoing FcgammaRI-mediated uptake of beta(2)GPI-bound anionic surfaces in the presence of IgG anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies. Finally, beta(2)GPI-bound oxidized LDL or activated platelets also induced the specific T-cell response. Continuous exposure to these anionic surfaces may play a critical role in maintaining the pathogenic anti-beta(2)GPI antibody response in patients with APS.
