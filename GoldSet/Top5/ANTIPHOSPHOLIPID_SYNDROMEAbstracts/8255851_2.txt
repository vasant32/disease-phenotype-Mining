A patient with the anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome and digital clubbing is described. No recognized cause for the clubbing was found. It is suggested that platelet aggregation and microthrombi formation as a result of anti-phospholipid antibody may be involved in the pathogenesis of the digital clubbing. This may be a new feature of the anti-phospholipid antibody.
