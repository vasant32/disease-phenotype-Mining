We studied the prevalence, isotype distribution, and clinical significance of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2glycoprotein I (anti-beta2GPI) antibodies in two populations of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 160 Colombians and 160 Spaniards. All sera were tested in our laboratory by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgG, IgM, and IgA aCL, as well as IgG and IgM anti-beta2GPI. Positive results for at least 1 of the 3 aCL isotypes were found in 40 Colombians (25%) and 55 Spaniards (34%). IgG aCL was the predominant isotype in both populations. Positive results for at least 1 of the anti-beta2GPI isotypes were found in 34 Colombians (21%) and 29 Spaniards (18%). IgG anti-beta2GPI was the dominant isotype in Colombians, while IgM was predominant in Spaniards. Positivity for anti-beta2GPI in aCL-positive patients was present in 77% in the Colombian group and 50% in the Spaniard group. Among Colombians, IgG aCL and anti-beta2GPI correlated with thrombosis, fetal loss, and thrombocytopenia. Among Spaniards, IgG aCL and IgG anti-beta2GPI correlated with thrombosis, fetal loss, and livedo reticularis. For detecting thrombosis and fetal loss, aCL ELISA was more sensitive than anti-beta2GPI in Spaniards, and anti-beta2GPI ELISA was more specific than aCL in both populations.
