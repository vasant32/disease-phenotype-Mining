An 87-year-old woman with antiphospholipid syndrome accompanied by cortical blindness and thalamic syndrome resulting from infarction of the posterior cerebral artery is reported. She was hospitalized because of laceration of the head. Two months later, she complained of loss of visual acuity, sharp pain and numbness involving the left half of the body except her face. New right posterior lobe infarction and the existence of old left infarctions were confirmed by serial CT scans. Helical CT scan revealed embolization of the posterior cerebral artery with atherosclerotic stenosis. Serological examination showed biologically false-positive and positive findings for lupus anticoagulant. She was treated with warfarin potassium and clonazepam.
