We describe the case of a young woman with a known history of thrombocytopenia, who developed respiratory and circulatory failure thought to be caused by sepsis. She subsequently was shown to have high titres of anticardiolipin antibodies as well as lupus anticoagulant. Serological tests for various connective tissue diseases were negative. Multiple cerebral ischaemic lesions led to a poor outcome. This case highlights the potential difficulties in differentiating catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome from disseminated intravascular coagulation.
