This study provides evidence that cardiolipin (CL) molecules are expressed on the surface of apoptotic cells and are recognized by antiphospholipid antibodies, purified from patients with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). CL expression on cell surface was demonstrated by high performance thin layer chromatography analysis of phospholipids from plasma membrane purified fractions and by the positive staining with the CL-specific dye nonyl-acridine orange. This finding was complemented with the observation that aCL IgG purified from patients with APS bind to the surface of apoptotic cells. This staining shows a clustered distribution mostly localized on surface blebs. Interestingly, CL exposure on the cell surface preceded the DNA fragmentation, as shown by cytofluorimetric analysis. These findings demonstrate that exposure of CL molecules on the cell plasma membrane is an early event of the apoptotic cellular program that may represent an in vivo trigger for the generation of aCL.
