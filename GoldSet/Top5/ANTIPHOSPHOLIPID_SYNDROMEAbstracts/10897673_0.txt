The clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome(APS) include arterial and venous thrombosis and a fetal loss, but the pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. To clarify the mechanism of thrombogenic state in APS, we investigated the markers for thrombosis including thrombin-antithrombin complex(TAT) in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies(aPL). Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2(F1 + 2) in patients with APS and in autoimmune disease patients with aPL increased significantly compared with those obtained in autoimmune disease patients without aPL or in control subjects. However, there was not a significant difference in the TAT level of each group, suggesting that the formation of TAT was impeded in APS. To investigate which aPL is responsible for the disturbance of the TAT formation, the ratio of F1 + 2/TAT was calculated. The ratio increased in patients with lupus anticoagulant, especially with prolonged kaolin clotting time, and furthermore the ratio strongly increased in patients with IgG type-anticardiolipin antibodies(aCL). Our results suggest that IgG-aCL is associated with thrombogenic state in APS because free thrombin is present in patients' blood by impeding the formation of TAT by mainly IgG-aCL.
