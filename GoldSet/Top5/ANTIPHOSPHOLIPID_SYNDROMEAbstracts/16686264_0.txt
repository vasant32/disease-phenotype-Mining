It has been widely accepted that the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune hypercoagulability syndrome in which a variety of venous and arterial thrombotic events may occur. Peripheral obliterating arterial disease characterized by aortoiliac steno-occlusion occurring in young women, is reported in the literature under the name of Small Aorta Syndrome (SAS). Although it remains unclear whether SAS represents a separate entity, the small size of the distal aorta increases the risk for aortoiliac occlusive disease. A 41-year old white woman was admitted with acute digital ischemia of the left foot. She had positive lupus anticoagulant and IgG anti-cardiolipin antibodies (61 UI/mL), but antinuclear antibodies and anti-ds-DNA antibodies were negative. She previously had two deep venous thromboses of the legs and, despite the oral anticoagulant therapy, pulmonary embolism occurred. Shortly thereafter, abdominal angio-magnetic resonance imaging suggested that the infra-renal aorta was narrowed more than 50%, without thrombotic occlusion of the terminal aorta and common iliac arteries. These findings were compatible with the features of SAS. There were no atherosclerotic changes in the artery wall and no other prediposing risk factors such as smoking, oral contraceptive or hyperlipidemia. After adequate anticoagulation and intravenous prostacyclin treatment the patient's symptoms and the ischemic lesions improved markedly. To our knowledge this is the first report of the association of SAS and primary APS. The occurrence of SAS in patients with APS may dramatically increase the risk of trombothic events.
