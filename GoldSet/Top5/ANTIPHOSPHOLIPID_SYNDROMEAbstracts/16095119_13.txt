OBJECTIVE: Livedo reticularis (LR) is a skin vasculopathy that has been frequently described in patients with anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) and reported to be present in association with valvular heart pathology and strokes (i.e. Sneddon's syndrome). METHODS: In a cohort of APS patients we investigated the possible association of LR with various clinical aspects of APS such as pregnancy morbidity, central nervous system (CNS) and cardiac manifestations. RESULTS: Livedo reticularis was found in 50/308 (16%) of APS patients, and there was a significant association with cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), migraines and epilepsy (p = 0.01, 0.002, and 0.02 respectively). A similar association was also detected between LR, and the presence of cardiac valve thickening and vegetations (p = 0.001). No association with venous thrombosis, recurrent fetal loss, IUGR or toxemia was found. CONCLUSION: Livedo reticularis is a frequent cutaneous manifestation in patients with APS. Its high association with cardiac and CNS thrombosis may suggest that LR-APS patients compose a subset at higher risk for thrombosis, and thus may require a closer follow-up and a more aggressive anticoagulation.
