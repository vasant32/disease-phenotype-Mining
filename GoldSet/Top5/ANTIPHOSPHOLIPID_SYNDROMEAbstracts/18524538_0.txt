Magnetic resonance images (MRI) of 103 patients were examined to reveal whether positive antinuclear antibody is a risk factor for cerebral ischemia. The most common MRI formation was the presence of small high-intensity spots. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus was significantly low. Although seven cases had no medical risk factors; they showed an abnormal MRI reading. Eleven cases exhibited signs of cerebral stroke. Positive antinuclear antibody cases are suggested to be part of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Various types of cerebral arterial occlusion may occur, showing lacuna, atheroma generation, and a recurrent major vessel occlusion.
