Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients with systemic immune-mediated diseases (SID) affecting the central nervous system (CNS) are heterogeneous and lack diagnostic specificity. In the present study, we evaluated the potential role of cervical cord MRI for increasing confidence when making a diagnosis of SID. Sagittal, T2-weighted images of the cervical cord were obtained in patients affected by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with (NSLE, n=9) and without clinical CNS involvement (n=15), Beh√ßet disease (BD, n=5), Wegener granulomatosis (WG, n=9), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLAS, n=6) and multiple sclerosis (MS, n=10). Spinal cord hyperintense lesions were found in 9/10 MS patients, while no lesions were visible in the cervical cord of any patient with SID, regardless of the presence or absence of brain abnormalities. Cervical cord MRI can be useful in diagnosing patients suspected of having a SID.
