The mechanisms underlying clinical abnormalities associated with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APAS) have not been elucidated. We measured plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], the active form of plasminogen activator inhibitor (active PAI), thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) and soluble thrombomodulin (TM), to investigate the relationship of these factors to thrombotic events in APAS. Mean plasma levels of Lp(a), TAT, active PAI and TM were all significantly higher in patients with aPL than in a control group of subjects. Plasma levels of Lp(a) and active PAI were significantly higher in patients with aPL and arterial thromboses than in patients with aPL but only venous thromboses. There was a significant correlation between plasma levels of Lp(a) and active PAI in patients with aPL. These findings suggest that patients with aPL are in hypercoagulable state. High levels of Lp(a) in plasma may impair the fibrinolytic system resulting in thromboses, especially in the arterial system.
