Eight patients, 3 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or "SLE-like" disease, 1 with sarcoidosis, and 4 with no connective tissue disease had transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or cerebral infarctions associated with high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA). Cerebral ischemic events included amaurosis fugax, recurrent hemispheric TIA, cerebral infarction, and multi-infarction dementia. Treatment with acetylsalicylic acid was ineffective in 3 patients. Warfarin, alone or in combination with dipyridamole or steroids, may reduce the risk of further cerebrovascular events.
