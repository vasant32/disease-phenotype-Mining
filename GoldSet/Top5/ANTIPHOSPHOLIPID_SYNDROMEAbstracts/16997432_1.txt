INTRODUCTION: Acute adrenal insufficiency during antiphospholipid syndrome is usually due to a bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. For a patient, an unilateral involvement has induced an acute adrenal insufficiency. CASE REPORT: A patient with an antiphospholipid syndrome has developed an acute adrenal insufficiency with an unilateral adrenal hemorrhage. This complication was caused by a concurrent steroid therapy, for an associated lupus, which resulted in a suppression of the contralateral adrenal gland. CONCLUSION: In patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and concurrent steroid therapy, usually for lupus, unilateral adrenal hemorrhage can cause acute adrenal insufficiency. Withdrawal of steroid might be difficult in case of undetected bilateral hemorrhage.
