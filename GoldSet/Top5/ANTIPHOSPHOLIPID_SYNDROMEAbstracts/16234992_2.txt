Transverse myelitis is a rare manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome, usually secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (Rheum Dis Clin North Am 20:129-158, 1994). Only about 110 reports of this complication have been reported (Lupus 10:851-856, 2001). A connection has been demonstrated between positive serology for antiphospholipid and transverse myelitis (Lupus 8:109-115, 1999). Herein, we report of a young patient admitted with deep vein thrombosis and neurological manifestations of transverse myelitis with negative serology for systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid, who developed positive anticardiolipin antibody during pulse therapy with cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone.
