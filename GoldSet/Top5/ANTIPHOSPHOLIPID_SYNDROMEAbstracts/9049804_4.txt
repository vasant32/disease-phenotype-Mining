To investigate cerebral lesions in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies only complaining of mild headaches, but without any neurological abnormalities or abnormal computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging findings, brain single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) using N-isopropyl-p-[123I] iodoamphetamine was employed as a sensitive method. Focal low perfusion areas and/or non-uniform radioisotope uptake could be shown on brain SPECT in all patients. Quantification of cerebral blood flow with a microsphere method revealed decreased cerebral blood flow. Hypoperfusion areas might be caused by microarterial thrombosis, microvenous thrombosis or vascular spasms. Early detection of cerebral abnormalities allows steps to be taken to protect against irreversible progress of cerebral blood flow. Therefore, brain SPECT should be performed in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies.
