The antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) are a heterogeneous group of immunoglobulins that have been related with alterations in blood coagulability in recent years. Patients with elevated titers of these antibodies have a high probability to develop thrombotic events, including cerebral infarct (CI). The tests currently used to detect these antibodies are the lupus anticoagulant and ELISA for anticardiolipin antibodies which have a larger proportion of positivity among young patients with CI. In our study we tested 66 patients with cerebral infarcts whose ages ranged from 15 to 40 years for the presence of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies. The results showed that eleven (16.65%) patients were positive for aPLs and three (4.55%) of them fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for primary antiphospholipid syndrome. These data point out to the importance of investigating aPLs in young patients with CI and its high prevalence in this group compared with healthy population.
