Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by recurrent fetal loss, arterial and venous thromboses, thrombocytopenia and circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. Few patients have a rapidly progressive, fatal outcome. We report two young patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibodies who died after a short course of disease. Although clinical and laboratory findings differed in both patients--small vessel thromboses and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia mimicking thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura predominated in one of the patients while small and medium size vessel thromboses without hemolysis were present in the other case--autopsy revealed widespread visceral thromboses in both of them, features consistent with a diagnosis of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. This syndrome has not been reported to occur in association with Pneumocistis carinii pneumonia as we describe in one of our patients.
