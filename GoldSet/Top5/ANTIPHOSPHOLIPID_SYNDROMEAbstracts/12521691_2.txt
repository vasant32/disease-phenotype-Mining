The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that autoantibodies to phospholipids and to oxidised low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) are increased in pre-eclamptic and eclamptic women compared with normal pregnancy. Serum concentrations of autoantibodies to ox-LDL and to cardiolipin were measured in 21 non-pregnant controls, 29 pregnant controls, 21 pre-eclamptic and six eclamptic women. Concentrations of IgG antibodies to ox-LDL and to cardiolipin were not significantly different in women with eclampsia as compared with the non-pregnant controls, pregnant controls and pre-eclampsia. Concentrations of IgM antibodies to cardiolipin were significantly lower in women with pre-eclampsia compared with non-pregnant controls and eclampsia. All three pregnant states differ markedly from the non-pregnant controls, of whom only 5% (1 of 21) had "high positive" IgG antibodies. These results suggest that ACAs rise as a result of the pregnant state rather than as a result of preeclampsia or eclampsia. According to these results, there is no evidence of increased production of serum autoantibodies against modified LDL in African women with pre-eclampsia, which may reflect reduced lipid peroxidation involving lipoproteins or no link at all. In addition, IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies have no diagnostic value in preeclampsia and eclampsia.
