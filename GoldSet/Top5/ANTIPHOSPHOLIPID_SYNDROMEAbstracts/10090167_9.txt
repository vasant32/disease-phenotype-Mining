OBJECTIVE: Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are thrombophilic risk markers in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The risk factors for recurrent venous or arterial thrombosis and indications for longterm anticoagulation therapy are debated. We hypothesized that carrying a second thrombophilic defect, factor V Leiden mutation, would increase the risk for thrombosis in patients with aPL. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with primary APS and 83 with SLE and aPL with or without thrombosis followed at 2 university hospitals were studied. Factor V mutation rate was analyzed in patients and in 200 healthy blood donors by polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of factor V Leiden mutation in patients with SLE and aPL or primary APS was similar to controls. Patients with deep vein thrombosis or arterial thrombosis did not have a significantly increased rate of factor V mutation compared to controls or to patients with aPL without thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Factor V Leiden mutation is not significantly associated with vein thrombosis in patients with aPL. However, due to the sample size we cannot rule out synergy between both factor V Leiden and aPL. A trend toward increased risk for thrombosis was detected in patients with the mutation and this should be analyzed in a larger study.
