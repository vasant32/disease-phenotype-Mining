Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by thrombosis and pregnancy loss in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), mainly anticardiolipin, anti-beta2-glycoprotein I and lupus anticoagulant. However, similar to systemic lupus erythematosus, APS is also characterized by multiple other autoantibodies including 'non-classical' aPL, as well as other antibodies. Herein we describe the autoantigen properties, prevalence and clinical importance of 30 different antibodies in APS. Among the other antibodies characterizing APS are autoantibodies directed to platelets, glycoproteins, various coagulation factors, lamins, mitochondrial antigens and cell surface markers. Few of these autoantibodies are correlated with the presence of other antibodies, and some may have an additive role in the pro-thrombotic tendency of the syndrome. This autoantibody explosion might be important in early identification of the syndrome and its manifestations.
