DESIGN: We have analyzed the frequency of HLA class I and II antigens in high-risk pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Altogether, 22 gravida hospitalized at the Department of Pathology of Pregnancy and Labour, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin formed group I (PE) with 12 cases of preeclampsia and group II with 10 cases of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The control group included 40 multigravida. Typing of HLA class I and II antigens was done using the two-stage microcytotoxic test (NIH) of Mittal. RESULTS: Antigen B35 was found more frequent in preeclampsia and antiphospholipid syndrome groups than in multigravida. Furthermore, a statistically significant difference in the frequency of homozygotes for the HLA-DR locus was noted between groups PE and APS on one hand, and controls on the other. CONCLUSIONS: Identical HLA-DR3, DR4 and DR5 antigens were found more frequently in preeclampsia, while identical DR4 and DR6 in the antiphospholipid syndrome.
