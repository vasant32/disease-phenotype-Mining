Pregnancy is a risk factor for deep and superficial venous thrombosis because of hemodynamic changes and modifications of the coagulation and fibrinolitic systems. In case of a patient suffering from a congenital or acquired thrombophilia, risk of severe and recurrent thrombosis becomes much higher, with the possibility of a life threatening complication as pulmonary embolism. Recently a number of congenital thombophilic syndromes have been described, in particular congenital hereditary deficit of coagulation inhibitors. Among the acquired pathologies, the antiphospholipid syndrome has been recently object of studies. Diagnostic and therapeutic options are still controversial. The authors present a case of recurrent deep vein thrombosis in pregnancy treated with positioning of a caval filter for the prophylaxis of pulmonary embolism. Diagnostic difficulties are discussed, as the patient presented with low levels of the coagulation inhibitor protein S, and also circulating antibodies anticardiolipin.
