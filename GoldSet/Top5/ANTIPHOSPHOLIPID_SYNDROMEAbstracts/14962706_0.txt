We describe two patients who developed stroke and ischemia of the left lower limb, related to intracardiac thrombi, as the first manifestation of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed intracardiac thrombi as abnormal hyperechogenic, nonmobile masses, firmly attached to the left atrial appendage and the anterior part of the mitral annulus, respectively. Our patients received high-intensity oral anticoagulant therapy (INR 3.0-4.0), which resulted in the rapid disappearance of clinical symptoms, without subsequent recurrence of thromboembolic manifestations, and the disappearance of intracardiac thrombi on TEE. Our findings underscore that PAPS should be suspected in patients presenting with intracardiac thrombi, even if they have no previous history of thromboembolic disorders. Moreover, because intracardiac thrombi may precede other manifestations of PAPS, this finding in young patients without underlying heart disease should invoke a search for both antiphospholipid and anticardiolipin antibodies.
