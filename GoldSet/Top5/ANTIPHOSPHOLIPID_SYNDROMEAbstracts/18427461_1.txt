Antibodies to phospholipids (ABPL) were studied in 40 patients, aged from 17 to 65 years, with symptomatic epilepsy. Those with primary or secondary antiphospholipid syndrome and with diffuse diseases of connecting tissues were not included in the study. All patients underwent clinical, neurological, electroencephalographic and immunological examination, the latter including the determination of ABPL level, namely the level of AB to cardiolipin in the blood serum using ELISA. It was shown that the ABPL level was 1,5-2,0 times higher in patients comparing to the controls. This increase was observed in patients with moderate and high frequency of seizures and a history of at least 2 seizures. Moreover, the ABPL level was depended on the etiologic factor and epileptic EEG activity. In conclusion, the results obtained suggest that ABPL not only interact with vessel endothelium but caused the immunologically mediated damage of cortical neurons that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of symptomatic epilepsy.
