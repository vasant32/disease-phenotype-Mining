Autoantibodies targeting beta2-glycoprotein l (beta2-GPI), a component of the atherosclerotic plaque, are commonly found in patients with acute ischemic syndromes. Serum samples from APS (antiphospholipid syndrome) patients and from cardiovascular patients exhibiting acute atherosclerotic syndromes were analyzed for IgG and IgA antibodies in both anti-beta2-GPI and anticardiolipin (aCL) ELISA assays. All of the APS samples used here were positive in both assays. Serum samples from 382 atherosclerosis patients were also analyzed for IgG and IgA antibodies in the same assays. In sharp contrast to the APS samples, we found that only 1% of the samples from atherosclerosis patients were positive for IgA aCL, and 1.6% positive for IgG aCL, whereas 35.6% were positive for IgA anti-beta2-GPI and only 1.6% for IgG anti-beta2-GPI. The antigenic specificity of 29 serum samples from atherosclerosis patients was evaluated. Six different recombinant domain-deleted mutants (DM) of human beta2-GPI and full-length human beta2-GPI (wild-type) were used in competitive inhibition assays to inhibit the autoantibodies from binding in the anti-beta2-GPI ELISA assays. Domain-deleted mutants D--345 and D--45 inhibited the binding in the IgA anti-beta2-GPI assay, suggesting that these autoantibodies recognize domain 4 of the beta2-GPI molecule. These results clearly show that IgA anti-beta2-GPI autoantibodies from atherosclerotic patients are distinct from IgA autoantibodies found in APS samples.
