The association of lymphoma and autoimmune manifestations has been predominantly studied in adults affected by non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Few publications exist in the literature concerning Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly in children and adolescents. The objectives of this study were to define the characteristics of the link between Hodgkin disease and autoimmunity in childhood. The present 25-year retrospective study was conducted in all centers affiliated with the French Society of Paediatric Oncology (SFCE). Eleven children with Hodgkin disease presented manifestations of disimmunity preceding or following their diagnosis. Four patients had thrombocytopenic purpura, the remaining 7 each had a different autoimmune pathology: lupus syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome with transient ischemic attack, Evans syndrome, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thyroiditis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Lymphoma relapse occurred in 3 patients. Two children died, death being directly attributed to the autoimmune disease in 1 case. Our data suggest that development of autoimmunity is related to significant morbidity. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms include lymphocyte proliferation secondary to chronic inflammation, cell-mediated immune deficiency in Hodgkin disease, molecular mimetics, and antineoplastic phenomena are discussed. A study with a larger patient population is needed to identify the group of children at high risk of autoimmunity for whom additional investigations and modified therapy may be indicated.
