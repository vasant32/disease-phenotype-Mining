AIM: To study characteristics of cardiovascular affection in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial included 28 patients with APS and NBTE (26 females, mean age 44 <+/- 13 years). Primary APS was diagnosed in 21 patients, secondary APS associated with systemic lupus erythematosus--in 7 patients. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in all the patients, transesophageal echocardiography--in 86% of them. Statistic processing was made with logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: All the patients had structural valvular changes: leaflet thickening, sclerosis, vegetations, focuses of calcinosis and valvular dysfunction. Vegetations located on mitral and aortic valves in 64% and occurred on damaged heart valves in 36% patients. An important problem in APS with NBTE was systemic embolism (54%), especially with involvement of central nervous system. Logistic regression revealed association of NBTE with structural changes of aortic and mitral valves, myocardial focal fibrosis and valvular insufficiency. CONCLUSION: APS with NBTE is characterized by absolute predominance of valvular heart lesion with vegetations location on the left heart valves and high risk of embolic complications.
