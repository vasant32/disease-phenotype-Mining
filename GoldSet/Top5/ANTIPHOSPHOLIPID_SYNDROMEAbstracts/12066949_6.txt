We present three pregnancies in which massive perivillous fibrous deposition (MPVFD) and maternal floor infarction (MFI) occurred in patients with primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (PAPS) attending a recurrent miscarriage clinic, and who were treated with low dose aspirin and heparin. We hypothesise that PAPS may be a predisposing factor to the development of this condition. The increased prevalence of late pregnancy complications in PAPS patients with a history of early miscarriage suggests that aspirin and heparin therapy does not eradicate the underlying pathological process but merely reduces the severity. Therefore, untreated early pregnancy losses may be converted into treated pregnancies with late antenatal complications. Some patients with PAPS may therefore be prone to suffer either the previously reported complications of the uteroplacental vasculature, such as pre-eclampsia, and/or specific complications related to the environment of the intervillus space, such as MPVFD/MFI.
