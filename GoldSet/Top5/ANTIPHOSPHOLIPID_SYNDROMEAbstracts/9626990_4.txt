Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by the presence of a heterogeneous class of antibodies directed against phospholipids and associated with high occurrence of thrombotic complications. Antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECAs) have been identified in various autoimmune disorders including APS, but their reactivity patterns remain unclear. We used eluted endothelial membrane-bound antibodies (EC eluates) to investigate possible cross-reactivity of AECAs and their pathogenic effects on endothelial cell integrity. The heterogeneous and nonspecific nature of AECAs was confirmed by our finding that they cross-react with fibroblasts and platelets and bind to cardiolipin. In addition, platelet-bound antibodies from sera of patients with APS reacted with endothelial cells. A dose-dependent binding of human monoclonal anticardiolipin antibody was demonstrated, but this antibody did not compete with AECAs in EC eluates, indicating that only small portion of AECAs are directed against cardiolipin. Although sera from APS patients prolonged coagulation tests, EC eluates did not affect coagulation, suggesting that AECAs may belong to antiphospholipid antibodies subsets that does not interfere with coagulation. Vascular damage is a common feature of autoimmune disorders associated with AECAs. Possible effects of AECAs on vascular perturbance were investigated by cytotoxicity, attachment, and migration assays. Although AECAs were not shown to be cytotoxic or to affect cell attachment, sera from APS patients caused reduced cellular migration (by 30%), and EC eluates caused even more significant inhibition (by 50%). These findings suggest possible interference of AECAs in vascular repair mechanisms and provide an explanation for the thrombotic complications frequently seen in APS patients.
