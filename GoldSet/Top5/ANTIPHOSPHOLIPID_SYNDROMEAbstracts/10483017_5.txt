We describe a 50-year-old woman who developed severe pain of the left lower limb after an episode of thrombophlebitis. Bone scintigraphy and thermography showed results indicative of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Laboratory analysis revealed the presence of the lupus anticoagulant. The patient was diagnosed as antiphospholipid syndrome complicated with reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the left lower limb. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with reflex sympathetic dystrophy with underlying antiphospholipid syndrome.
